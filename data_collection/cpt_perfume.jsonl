"Note Group: citrus smells -- Most often by citrus in perfumery we describe the whole spectrum of hesperidic fruits (Hesperidia), named after the Hesperides, nymphs from Greek mythology. These are fruits or citrus-smelling raw materials (notably verbena and lemongrass) and a few are among the most ancient ingredients in perfumery alongside resins. The more modern variations, such as pomelo, grapefruit, yuzu and hassaku, are relatively recent developments in the area of perfume extraction. The citrus essences are expressed or cold-expressed in most cases to preserve their inherent freshness. Petitgrain is an exception, as it comes from the steam distillation of the twigs and leaves of the bitter orange tree. Citruses provide a refreshing and effarvescent quality to fragrances, accounting for the top note which tickles our noses with pleasure. They're helpful for clearing one's mind and feel sunny and optimistic, lending an air of easy elegance and cleanness. Bergamot especially is an integral part of the classic Eau de Cologne formula. Citruses are a classic companion to more tenacious floral and resinous notes in oriental fragrances and they also provide a good companion to other fruity notes, cutting the sugar and injecting tartness.more..."
"Note Group: fruits, vegetables and nuts -- Fruity notes beyond citrus (which form a class of its own) have become so popular in recent years that they deserve a category of their own. Vegetable notes are more unusual, sometimes rendered through illusion: an example would be the turnip note that iris rhizome sometimes produces. As a rule fruits and vegetables are resistant to distillation and extraction processes due to the very high percentage of water in their natural make-up, and they remain a reconstructed note in fragrances. Their effect ranges from the refreshing to the succulent, all the way to the musty and mysterious. Fruits and vegetables provide a nuanced texture and a refreshing feel in fragrances. Fruits especially have been extremely popular in the floral fruity category in the 2000s, while peach and plum have been major components in classical perfumers' \"bases\" (such as the famous Persicol) which produced many of the iconic fragrances of the first half of the 20th century. Nuts in perfumes usually include the very popular almond (sometimes confused with the cherry-pie tree, which is a heliotrope and most often replicated through the same materials used for heliotrope and mimosa reconstructions), peanuts (as in Bois Farine), hazelnuts (as in Praline de Santal and Mechant Loup). They are all recreated notes. Nutty notes can be beautiful anchors to more ethereal or earthy materials, such as vetiver, as evidenced in Vetiver Tonka in the Hermessences. more..."
"Note Group: flowers -- A self-evident category of fragrance notes, directly smelling of fragrant blossoms, often rich in nuance: from the banana top note of ylang-ylang, the wine nuances in fresh roses and the powdery, almond-like character of heliotrope, to the camphorous side of freshly-picked tuberose, all the way through the apricot scent of osmanthus, the lemony touches of magnolia and the caramelic facets of lavender, flowers can present surprising sides which never cease to fascinate not just insects, but humans as well. Many of the flowers are rendered through natural sources: Rose and jasmine are notoriously prized for their incomparable essences, rendered through many different techniques (solvent extraction, enfleurage, distillates). The other natural flower extracts include broom, tuberose, lavender, osmanthus, immortelle, ylang ylang and marigold. Other flowers refuse to yield their core aroma, or the yield is so minute that replicating the scent in the lab is the way to go. Violet, lotus and water lily do produce an absolute, but it's very expensive and the yield is so small that only niche and artisanal/all-natural brands can afford to use them. The following flowers are typically reconstructed in the lab via several synthetic molecules: freesia, peony, lily of the valley, mimosa, heliotrope, violet (most of the time), jonquil, narcissus, hyacinth... Floral scents add a romantic and often feminine touch to a composition, augmenting the feel of natural beauty derived from smelling a composition, fanning the fleeting top notes onto a tapestry where everything has its place and alleviating some of the heaviness of more tenacious materials, such as resins and balsams. Natural flower extracts also work with the psyche, if we are to believe aromatherapy, in ameliorating the contact with the natural world and providing spiritual uplift. Flowers play an important role in the floral fragrance family, obviously, but they manage to enter almost all perfume compositions in one form or another, from the lightest eau de cologne to the most lush oriental, even in some masculine colognes. They notably play an intriguing part in \"floral orientals\" (florientals), where they shine clearest amidst the opulence of materials of Eastern origin. more..."
"Note Group: white flowers -- This is a subgroup within the Flowers group, but it merits its own entry due to the fact that \"white flowers\" are the basis for a whole fragrance sub-category: the \"white florals.\" By white flowers, we refer to orange blossom, jasmine, gardenia, tuberose, frangipani. Even though honeysuckle can actually be yellow-colored in nature, its scent profile is not that of yellow flowers (such as mimosa, and it's typified by the sweet, nectarous headiness of white flowers. Lily of the valley, although white in color, is classified as a \"green floral\" as it lacks some of the characteristics of the other white florals and shares facets with other members of the \"green floral\" groups (according to Edmond Roudnitska's classification): hyacinth and narcissus. White flowers have the most narcotic scent of all flowers; lush, opulent and truly intoxicating, almost a code for intense femininity in any fragrance they star in. more..."
"Note Group: greens, herbs and fougeres -- By the term \"green\" we refer to notes of snapped leaves and freshly-cut grasses, which exude a piquant quality. In this classification we find some of the classic pungent essences, such as galbanum, which is actually a resin from a tall type of grass with a bracing, piercingly bitter green odor profile. This is the decidedly spring-like top note of vintage Vent Vert by Balmain where it was first put to use in a starring role. Fig leaf is a unique note rendered through synthetics which gives the modern \"fig\" fragrances their bitter-green-allied-to-coconut-sweet scent. Another peculiar leaf note that has a special character is tomato leaf, featured in Eau de Campagne by Sisley, Folavril by A.Goutal and Liberte Acidulee by Les Belles de Nina Ricci. Violet leaf is a modern green \"leaves\" note which is very popular. It gives an aqueous feel reminiscent of freshly-cut cucumber to many compositions, especially masculine ones. A subcategory apart are tea leaves notes which infuse blends with their unique aromatic profile, according to which variety the perfumer picks (green, red, white, black, Oolong, etc). Herbs are refered to as \"aromatic notes\" by perfumers. These include herbs which we know from cooking, such as rosemary, thyme, mint, tarragon, marjoram, fennel, basil (which is considered a spicy note thanks to its eugenol content), sage, anise. Others, such as artemisia, calamus, angelica and spikenard (jatamansi) have an intensely herbaceous quality that is so distinctive as to immediately characterize the compositions in which they enter. Fern is the anglification of the fragrance term foug\u00e8re (fern in French), which is not exactly derived from nature (ferns have minimal scent themselves) but from an historical \"accord\" between lavender-oakmoss-coumarin which was devised to produce the mysterious note of a green, damp forest. The archetype of this type of fragrance is Foug\u00e8re Royale by Houbigant, created by Paul Parquet in 1882. The effect was an interplay between sweet and bitter with a woody, damp and cool character, establishing foug\u00e8res as the quintessential masculine fragrances. Ferny fragrances recreate the earthy, damp and dark scents of a forest and largely rely on fantasy notes, even though extraction with volatile solvents of the Aspidium fern is possible, though hardly satisfactory in quantity. The subcategory of aromatic foug\u00e8res, adding spices and herbal notes to the classic structure, is perhaps the most populated masculine colognes category thanks to its pliability. more..."
"Note Group: spices -- The Spices group is a familiar category of perfume notes, thanks mainly to their long-standing inclusion in food. Some of them have pride of place in any self-respecting kitchen spice cabinet, such as cinnamon, pepper, cloves, coriander, ginger. Others are more unusual, from the precious hand-picked saffron, to tamarind and caraway and the very gentle, rose-hued pink pepper. True spices are always dried, but there are some herbs which have a spicy tang to them, such as oregano. These can be used both fresh or dry. Spices are classified as \"hot/short\" (intense and burning for a short duration) such as cinnamon, and \"cold/long\" (gentler, giving a cooling sensation rather than burning, with a prolonged aftertaste) such as coriander, caraway and cardamom. This helps the perfumer give the desired effect when handling spices according to his or her concept of a fragrance. They can be coupled with similar materials to reinforce their message, or they can provide a juxtaposing element. more..."
"Note Group: sweets and gourmand smells -- This succulent group of scent notes has really established itself and multiplied henceforth with the advent of \"gourmand\" fragrances, a sub-division of the Oriental fragrance group, in the 1990s and 2000s. These fragrances, largely built on vanilla, are reminiscent of foody smells, specifically sweets and desserts; ranging from the simpler chocolate, fresh cream and caramel smells to complex or more exotic recipes such as macaroons, cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e, the ever popular cupcakes and chewy nougat. The first successful \"gourmand\" fragrance was Angel, launching in 1992, which produced a caramel and chocolate effect through the use of ethyl maltol (the scent of cotton candy/sugar caramel), natural patchouli (which has a cocoa facet) alongside industry standard ethyl vanillin. From then on, given Angel's commercial success, dessert smells flourished and this group of notes is among the most important in contemporary perfumery. Although some natural materials do present facets that are sweet or foody, the vast majority of these notes are reproduced via clever intermingling of naturals and synthetics. Although mostly used in feminine fragrances, which can more easily encompass sweeter notes, gourmand notes are not excluded from masculine or shared scents.  These edible notes produce a feeling of euphoria and playfulness, resulting in a tingling of the taste buds in addition to the nostrils, thus confirming the fact that flavor is a combination of taste and smell. They make us see our perfume in a completely novel way and are intriguing when used by a skilled perfumer who can manipulate them to create increasingly complex aromas. more..."
"Note Group: woods and mosses -- Woody notes are dependable and pliable, a sort of a Jack in the deck of a skilled perfumer, providing the bottom of a composition and reinforcing the other elements according to their olfactory profile. Precious few of the woody notes can serve as a top note or middle note, namely rosewood. The scent profile of woods ranges wildly across the different trees. Some of them can be tarry and phenolic smelling, like guiacwood. Others are austere and reminiscent of a case of new pencils; think cedarwood. Others still are creamy, milky, nuzzling and deeply soft, like sandalwood. And there are those woody notes which are so individual that they can characterise the whole composition: Agarwood/Oud, rather the byproduct of the Aquillaria tree's fighting of a fungus disease, is so rich and complex that it encompasses nutty, woody, musty, even camphoraceous scents. Or think how pine or fir reminds us of specific seasons, thanks to their associations. Thought some woody notes are produced via natural means, such as maceration and distillation of the actual wood chips, several other notes, as well as some of the ones that could be produced via the natural product, are produced via lab synthesis. The reasons include sustainability, cost efficiency and safety. Vetiver and patchouli are interesting exceptions in the group of woody notes, in that vetiver is actually a grass with an intricate root system and patchouli is the leaf of an Eastern bush, but their scent profile is woody, hence the classification. Woody notes are par excellence the domain of masculine fragrances, thanks mostly to the robust association the trees bring to mind and less due to their scent, but their pliability makes them an essential component in feminine and shared fragrances are well. Indeed there are very few fragrances not boasting at least one woody note in their make-up. Mosses comprise a sub-group, as they consist of parasitical lichen organisms growing on trees, such as oakmoss (Evernia prunastri) and tree moss (Evernia furfuracea). The scent profile of mosses is irreplaceable, though major efforts are made in the fragrance industry to produce scent-identical molecules now that these raw materials have fallen under rationing from the International Fragrance Association (IFRA). Mosses are inky-bitter in scent, with a deep, disturbing murkiness, darkly green, replicating the forest floor during autumn. For this reason they're notoriously used as the backbone of the chypre and foug\u00e8re fragrance families; indeed, oakmoss is one foot of the triad of the accords which comprise the skeleton of these two categories. Their properties are grounding, pensive, introspective and darkly sensual, giving retro fragrances a distinctive quality. more..."
"Note Group: resins and balsams -- The raw materials falling under the umbrella of resins and balsams are among the most ancient components of perfumes, often the basis of the Oriental family of scents. They are classified into different olfactory profiles according to their aromatic properties. Soft balsamic-smelling ingredients include vanilla, benzoin, Peru balsam, Tolu balsam (close to Peru but a little sweeter and fresher). They have a gentle tone, while at the same time they're softly enveloping and have a pronounced character. They fix flowers into lasting longer, and thanks to their properties when used in large quantities, they produce the semi-Orientals or the florientals (in conjunction with rich floral essences). Resinous balsamic ingredients include opoponax, frankincense/olibanum, myrrh, birch tar, elemi and styrax. These materials are deeper, with a lingering trail which adds originality and projection to a composition. Since they themselves come from the bark of trees in the form of crystalised resin \"tears,\" they pair very well with woody scents.more..."
"Note Group: musk, amber, animalic smells -- The term \"animalic\" refers to both raw aroma materials and \"fantasy\" notes (derived from synthesis in the lab) which directly evoke a scent reminiscent of animals\u2014either real ones, or more metaphorically, the libidinous nature of our own human animal instincts\u2014and their primal force. In perfumery, animal notes were traditionally rendered through deer musk, castoreum, ambergris and civet cats, but nowadays, ethical concerns for these animals' welfare have rendered their use obsolete and the substitution with synthetic variants a rule. (Only ambergris is by its nature cruelty-free, being naturally expelled by the sperm whale itself in the ocean, but it's a very rare and expensive ingredient for most commercial use, so synthetics replicating its aroma are the standard practice). Musk especially has been synthesized in the lab in hundreds of variants, resulting in slightly different odor profiles for each (Galaxolide, Habanolide, Ethyl Brassylate, Allyl Amyl Glycolate etc). Amber notes are different from ambergris in that the former is a mix of resins producing a warm, sweetish and very deep scent (most often in the \"Oriental\" family), while the latter is a rather salty, subtly skin-like deep note with no great sweetness to it. A few cases of animals indirectly used for animalic notes\u2014with absolutely no harm rendered to the animal in question\u2014are hyrax (the petrified excrement of which is used), goat hair tincture, roasted sea shells and beeswax from beehives. Some plants, such as Angelica and Ambrette Seeds, also produce animalic-smelling compounds that replicate musk. Last but not least, perfumery makes use of \"fantasy notes,\" rendered through creative mixing of various ingredients or single synthetic reconstitution, that recall the ambience of some scents with animal inferences, such as milk, caviar, starfish, skunk cabbage, bacon, bbq cuts, leather or suede hide.more..."
"Note Group: beverages -- Fragrances often recreate the scent of popular beverages in some part of their formula, from the festive fizz of Champagne and the caramelized toasty flavor of Coca Cola, to the tropical delights of Pina Colada or the creaminess of a good cup of cappuccino. These recreations are made possible by: * utilization of ingredients that make up part of the recipe for a given drink (Coca Cola, for instance, in which lime juice, vanilla extract, cinnamon, neroli, orange, coriander and nutmeg feature prominently) * the association of some raw materials with scents we know from beverages (i.e. the wine-like note in some rose essences, or the gin-like scent of juniper berries, because the latter are actually used to aromatize the former, etc.) * synthetic molecules which have been engineered to produce the desired effect. Beverage notes in fragrances provide a succulent, appetizing effect, often combined in fruity floral blends or \"gourmand\" fragrances which seduce the taste buds as well as the nostrils.more..."

"Note: Frangipani -- Frangipani, also known as the Hawaiian Lei flower or Plumeria, has been used in perfumery since the 16th century, usually as a top or heart note. The flowers from a frangipani tree are either white, yellow, pink, or multi-color. The name, frangipani, comes from the Italian nobleman, Marquis Frangipani, who created a perfume used to scent gloves in the 16th century. When the frangipani flower was discovered its natural perfume reminded people of the scented gloves, and so the flower was called frangipani. Radiant and captivating, Frangipani is an irresistibly, timeless and enticing fragrance. Nothing evokes that tropical feeling like the serene scent of Frangipani. Frangipani also known as Plumeria, is perhaps the queen of all tropical flowers. For centuries, Frangipani has been one of the great plants for human adornment.

In perfumery, Fraser Fir is esteemed for its vibrant and refreshing fragrance profile, which perfectly captures the essence of pine forests. This makes it a favored choice in crafting fragrances that aim to evoke the invigorating freshness of the outdoors and wintery landscapes. The oil extracted from Fraser Fir is typically obtained through steam distillation of the needles, which is the most effective method to capture its complex scent profile consisting of clean, woody, and earthy notes. This essential oil is utilized in various fragrance compositions, particularly in those belonging to the woody fragrance family. It is adept at blending with other fragrance notes, including woody, spicy, and citrus, to create a multi-dimensional olfactory experience.

"Note: Galbanum -- Galbanum is an aromatic gum resin and a product of certain umbelliferous Persian plant species in the genus Ferula, chiefly Ferula gummosa and Ferula rubricaulis. Galbanum-yielding plants grow plentifully on the slopes of the mountain ranges of northern Iran. Its use in perfumery goes back millennia: galbanum appears in the Old Testament as an ingredient in holy incense, and was an ingredient of the Egyptian perfume Metopian. Galbanum essential oil is quite different to the gum: intensely green, slightly bitter, earthy. This resin is a must-have for ingredient in the chypre family of fragrances, in a marriage with patchouli, bergamot and oakmoss: rich, green, mysterious, woody. A little dry, but with hints of pine in there, too. It evolves over time and is very complex, and requires a perfumer's deftest touch \u2013 but it's incredibly valuable to 'noses' as a fixative. It works wonderfully in floral accords alongside hyacinth, iris, narcissus, violet and gardenia \u2013 and blends well with spices, too."
"Note: Galbanum Leaf -- Galbanum Leaf, distinct from the resin of the Ferula plant, brings its own unique characteristics to fragrances.

"Note: Gardenia -- Gardenia, also known as the Hawaiian Lei flower, is a popular ingredient in perfumes. It gets its name from the US botanist Dr. Alexander Garden. The use of gardenia in perfumery can be traced back to ancient China, where the flower was used to make tea, incense, and perfumes. It takes around three to four thousand kilos of gardenia flowers to produce a kilo of 'concrete' (solid perfume) from gardenia plants \u2013 so not surprisingly, this heady white flower is one of the priciest ingredients in a perfumer's arsenal. Not surprisingly, a synthetic version's often used. Alternatively, perfumers can mix other white flowers to create a gardenia-esque effect \u2013 tuberose, jasmine and orange blossom do the trick. Gardenia flower oil was used in fragrances in the early part of the 20th century. Today gardenia flower oil is scarcely produced, and synthetic compounds are used more often."
"Note: Gentiana -- Gentiana, commonly referred to as gentian, is a genus of flowering plants notable for their strikingly vibrant blue flowers. The scent profile of gentian is not as widely recognized as its visual appeal because the flowers themselves are not typically fragrant. However, in perfumery, the concept of a \"Gentiana note\" often conveys a blend of aromatic, bitter, and cool scent qualities, reminiscent of the flavor of gentian root, which is used in liqueurs. The use of Gentiana in perfumery is more about evoking the alpine freshness and natural bitterness associated with the plant and its herbal extracts.

Europe saw ginger for the first time in the 1st century when the ancient Romans traded with India. Over a thousand years before the birth of Christ, dried ginger and other spices were traded from India to the Middle East via Arabia, but the true sources of these aromatics were kept secret by the crafty traders for another thousand years. In the world of fragrances, ginger is bracing, uplifting and almost nose-tinglingly spicy. It pairs beautifully with vanilla, woody notes and citrus, as well as white flowers like jasmine and neroli. This spice is used quite widely in perfumery."
"Note: Ginger Flower -- Ginger Flower, known for its distinctively spicy and fresh floral scent, is used in perfumery to add an exotic and vibrant touch.

It is commonly used in gourmand perfumes to enrich the composition with its inviting, homely scent, making it particularly popular in winter-themed or holiday fragrances. The note is typically created using a blend of synthetic molecules designed to mimic the complex aroma of baked gingerbread, as distilling the actual spices in their cookie form to extract essential oils isn\u2019t practical for perfumery purposes."
"Note: Ginkgo -- Ginkgo, derived from the leaves of the Ginkgo biloba tree, is known for its unique, fresh, and green scent. In perfumery, ginkgo adds a botanical and earthy dimension, reminiscent of a damp forest floor and freshly cut greenery.

Younger Ginseng plants exhibit a milder aroma, while the scent intensifies as the plant ages.

Although technically a member of the citrus family, grapefruit's invigorating yet elegant scent is both unique and diverse from others of its ilk. White grapefruit notes are bitter and sharp, while pink and red grapefruit tones are sugary and sensual. As a top note in many formulations, its character renders a fresh, crisp and juicy initiation to the notes that follow. Unlike other citrus fruits that have rich, colorful and ancient histories, grapefruit is a fairly new species that was first seen in Barbados and documented in 1750. A lover of nature, he was on a personal mission to discover the tree from the Garden of Eden. He was reminded of the biblical golden apple when he saw large grapefruit dangling from tree branches, and this fanciful notion helped to foster the popularity of the grapefruit and the belief that it was the \u201cforbidden fruit\u201d from the Garden of Eden. Grapefruit was brought to Florida in 1823 by business man, Count Odet Philippe, who was the first permanent, non-native settler in the state. To this day, Florida is the world's leading producer of grapefruit. At first, it was not popular due to its unusually thick skin. Floridians also found it to be too sour, and it was not widely planted. It was considered an exotic novelty fruit until the late 1920s when the burgeoning citrus industry was rapidly expanding. Grapefruit has been a household favorite in the United States since the 1940s."

The aim is to replicate the crisp, fresh, and sometimes slightly bitter or herbal qualities of greenery. Perfumes featuring a Green Accord are often characterized by their freshness and vitality, reminiscent of a walk through a lush garden or a forest after the rain. The Green Accord can vary from grassy and sharp to soft and dewy, depending on the combination of ingredients used. It adds a natural and often invigorating dimension to fragrances, making it a popular choice in various scent compositions, especially in the spring and summer collections."
"Note: Green Almond -- Green Almond refers to the unripe stage of almonds and is known for its distinctly fresh, slightly bitter, and nutty aroma. This unique scent profile distinguishes it from the sweeter and warmer aroma of ripe almonds. The use of Green Almond in perfumery is relatively niche. Its fresh and mildly sharp scent adds an interesting dimension to fragrance compositions, often lending a sense of raw, crisp freshness. This makes it a choice ingredient for perfumers aiming to introduce a green, slightly astringent, and natural note to their creations. In fragrances, the inclusion of Green Almond contributes to a natural, green, and subtly bitter undertone. It pairs well with floral, fruity, and woody notes, offering a counterpoint to sweeter or heavier scents. The use of Green Almond is particularly effective in compositions seeking to evoke the freshness of spring or the natural aroma of a garden."
"Note: Green Apple -- Green Apple, scientifically known as Malus domestica, is a popular ingredient in fragrances. It is native to Central Asia, where it has been grown for thousands of years. Green Apple has a fresh, crisp, mouthwatering quality, reminiscent of biting into an apple itself. Apples have been a part of fragrance creation right back to the medieval era of Arab perfumery. It isn't just the fruit that's used: apple blossom gives a soft, floral air to fragrances \u2013 and lately, there's been a trend to using something called an 'apple tree' note: in fact, a synthetic, 'fantasy' ingredient which delivers a fruity-woodiness. Through the rise in popularity of fruity-floral fragrances, apple's been having a moment in the sun. Green apple is probably the most underrated fragrance note. It's there in shampoos, perfumes, candles, and even agarbattis, but we don't give this fresh, fruity, clean, juicy, and cool scent its due. In truth though, we really should, because it's incredibly uplifting, delicious, and refreshing."
"Note: Green Fern -- Green Fern in perfumery is appreciated for its natural, earthy, and lush green aroma. This scent evokes the freshness of damp forests and shaded undergrowth, contributing to a fragrance's overall sense of natural wilderness. Used to add a verdant and crisp character, Green Fern notes capture the essence of a cool, dense forest.     The aroma of Green Fern is typically derived from natural sources, capturing the essence of the fern plant. In fragrances, it is used to contribute a fresh, green aspect, often found in compositions that aim to evoke a sense of being in nature."
"Note: Green Leaves -- Green Leaves in perfumery often represent the essence of freshness and naturalness. The concept of green notes in fragrances, which includes elements like green leaves, traces its origins back to the period following World War II. This was a time when there was a collective yearning for renewal and hope, and the fresh, dynamic character of green notes like those of green leaves resonated with this sentiment. Green leaves in fragrances capture the essence of nature, often evoking the scent of a crumpled leaf, the freshness of wet grass, or the aroma of a lush, green garden. Perfumers use green notes, including green leaves, to impart a sense of crispness and sharpness to their creations. These notes are typically utilized in the top or heart notes of a perfume, where they bring vibrancy and liveliness. The use of green leaves can be complex; it involves balancing their natural freshness with other elements in the fragrance. Too little, and their volatile nature may fade quickly, but too much can lead to a bitter and overpowering scent. When skillfully blended, green leaves add a unique freshness, enhancing floral, chypre, or even fruity fragrances, making the perfume come \"alive\" with natural energy."
"Note: Green Lemon -- Green Lemon is a vibrant and zesty ingredient in the world of perfumery. Its aroma is characterized by a sharp, fresh, and tangy scent, reminiscent of unripe lemons. This makes it distinctly different from the more commonly used ripe lemon scent, offering a greener, more vegetal quality. In fragrance formulations, Green Lemon imparts an invigorating and lively freshness. It is often used to add a burst of energetic citrus to the top notes of a perfume, setting the stage for a refreshing sensory experience. Its natural acidity and brightness make it an excellent complement to other citrus and green notes, enhancing the overall crispness and vibrancy of the fragrance. Green Lemon's role in perfumery extends to creating an atmosphere of rejuvenation and spontaneity. It is especially popular in fragrances designed for spring and summer, capturing the essence of youth and natural vitality."
"Note: Green Lilac -- Green Lilac in perfumery is a synthetic creation designed to evoke the scent of traditional lilacs with a fresh, green twist.

Its use in fragrances adds a dimension of spring-like freshness, marrying the familiar with the innovative."
"Note: Green Lily -- Green Lily is a fragrance note derived from the scent profile of the lily flower, particularly emphasizing the fresher, greener aspects of the plant. Unlike the more traditional, heavily floral lily scent, Green Lily captures the crispness of green leaves and the freshness of dew on lily petals. Historically, lilies have been a staple in perfumery due to their rich and intoxicating aroma, but the Green Lily variant focuses on bringing out the youthful and vivacious side of the flower, making it a popular choice in modern fragrances aimed at a fresh and clean scent profile. Green Lily is typically used to add a vibrant, spring-like freshness to fragrances, evoking a sense of renewal and nature\u2019s awakening. Its use in perfumery can be traced back to the desire for lighter, less overwhelming floral scents that can appeal to a broader audience, including those who may find traditional floral notes too intense."
"Note: Green Mandarin -- Green Mandarin, also known as Citrus Reticulata, is a very sunny citrus note. This citrus has more character than bergamot, and is also more bitter and greener. This note is different because its scent is impregnated with the skin of the citrus fruit, it brings a big smile to the fragrance. Green mandarin fruits are the first to appear on the tree and therefore contain less natural sugar. The higher levels of acidity in this fruit make the scent sharper and more distinctly citrusy. Because of this, we often use it in fragrances and cleaning products. And it's usually cold-pressed rather than steam distilled. The name mandarin came from China, where the fruit was once given as a gift to Mandarins during the holidays. During the Chinese New Year, the mandarin is considered as a symbol of abundance. It is often used as a decoration and given as a gift to family and friends. This citrus fruit native to China was introduced to Europe in the 19th century, much later than the orange tree. Mandarin is a prominent note in L'Instant by Guerlain, developed by Maurice Roucel and created in collaboration with Sylvaine Delacourte. This exotic white floral fragrance for women is composed of jasmine, tuberose and magnolia, with a sensual and oriental base note of vanilla created with benzoin resin."
"Note: Green Mango -- Green Mango in perfumery captures the essence of the unripe fruit, offering a unique blend of tangy, crisp, and slightly sour notes that convey freshness and vibrancy. Unlike its ripe counterpart, which is often lush and sweet, green mango provides a zestier and more refreshing profile. This makes it a perfect choice for perfumes designed to evoke a sense of youthful energy and spontaneous adventure. The use of Green Mango in fragrances is typically achieved through synthetic recreations to ensure consistency and longevity in the scent profile. These synthetic versions adeptly mimic the sharp, invigorating aroma of a freshly cut green mango, enhancing fragrances with a clean and bright aspect. It's a popular note in the creation of summer scents or tropical-themed fragrances, often paired with other fruity and citrus notes to enhance the overall perception of freshness."
"Note: Green Notes -- Green Notes in fragrances refer to a family of fragrances that started appearing after WWII. These fragrances feature fresh and lively notes that evoke freshly cut grass or stems, green leaves, foliage, mosses, green tea or other green vegetal scents. The first use of green notes in fragrance dates back to turbulent days following the Second World War, symbolising life and a sense of renewal, much needed at the time. One particularly interesting green note is called galbanum, a plant native to Iran and the Middle East. Similar to fennel, it produces a fragrant gum resin. It is quite pungent and harsh but when used in small quantity, galbanum conjures up the smell of crushed leaves, ivy, green beans and damp earth, all reminiscent of spring smells. Green notes can also come from aromatic herbs. A scent is considered 'aromatic' when it's herbal in nature. Fresh & uplifting, they contain herbaceous ingredients such as rosemary, lavender, thyme, sage, basil and more. Fresh aromatics combine these herbs with citrussy elements for an airy outdoorsy feel. Aromatics can also be complemented by woody elements such as mosses, patchouli and resins."
"Note: Green Orchid -- Green Orchid is a sophisticated and elegant fragrance note inspired by the lush and vibrant orchids found in nature. In perfumery, Green Orchid captures the fresh, green, and slightly floral aroma of orchid leaves and stems, evoking the essence of blooming orchids in a verdant garden. This note adds a crisp, vegetal quality to fragrances, bringing a sense of tranquility and natural beauty. While not derived from direct extraction, Green Orchid is crafted synthetically to replicate the intricate scent profile of orchid foliage. Historically, orchids have symbolized luxury and refinement, and their inclusion in fragrances reflects these attributes. Green Orchid enhances floral, green, and woody compositions, providing depth and a refreshing lift that balances sweeter and heavier notes. Its versatile nature allows it to blend seamlessly with citrus, herbal, and aromatic elements, contributing to a well-rounded and harmonious scent."
"Note: Green Pear -- Green Pear in perfumery brings a fresh, sweet, and crisp dimension. This note is derived from the essence of unripe pears, capturing the fruit's natural greenness and subtle sweetness. Unlike its ripe counterpart, Green Pear offers a lighter, more refreshing aroma. The use of Green Pear in fragrances is a relatively modern trend, aimed at creating a youthful and vibrant olfactory experience. It's often employed in the top notes, giving the initial burst of fragrance a juicy, uplifting character. This makes it popular in spring and summer collections, where freshness and lightness are key.

The scent of Green Tea in fragrances is typically captured from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant through natural extraction methods. These methods ensure the true essence of green tea is represented, contributing to fragrances with a fresh, herbal, and rejuvenating profile."
"Note: Green Violet -- Green Violet is a sophisticated fragrance note that captures the fresh, green, and slightly floral aroma of violet leaves. Unlike traditional violet notes that emphasize the sweet and powdery aspects of the violet flower, Green Violet focuses on the crisp, leafy, and herbaceous facets, evoking the essence of lush gardens and vibrant foliage. In perfumery, Green Violet adds a nuanced vegetal quality that enhances the depth and complexity of fragrances. Historically, violet notes have been cherished for their elegance and versatility, but the introduction of Green Violet offers a modern twist by emphasizing the green, natural elements associated with the plant. This note is commonly used in green, floral, and fresh fragrance compositions, where it complements other botanical and citrus notes, providing a balanced and invigorating scent profile.

"Note: Hedione -- Hedione, a synthetic molecule used in perfumery, was first synthesized by Swiss fragrance and flavor company Firmenich in the 1960s. It was created as a cost-effective and stable substitute for the expensive fragrance ingredient jasmine, replicating its fresh and floral scent. The story of Hedione began in 1957 when Firmenich researcher Edouard Demole identified methyl jasmonate as the heart of a jasmine flower fraction. He soon synthesized its dihydro derivative, methyl dihydrojasmonate, which was commercialized as Hedione. The first significant usage of Hedione was seen in Christian Dior Eau Sauvage, created by Edmond Roudnitska in 1966. Today, due to its versatility, power and ever more affordable pricing, the ingredient is used at increasingly higher doses in fine fragrance and has been applied in all perfumery segments. Hedione combines remarkably well with various perfumery materials."
"Note: Heliotrope -- Heliotrope, a natural ingredient with a sweet, floral, and slightly nutty aroma, was first utilized in perfumery during the 19th century after it was introduced by European explorers and botanists. Its popularity led to widespread use in various products such as perfumes, cosmetics, skin care and traditional medicines. When you smell something sweet, powdery, fluffy-little-cloud-like in a perfume, chances are there's a touch of heliotrope in there. Or do you get a whiff of almond\u2026? Maybe that's chameleon-like heliotrope, in the blend\u2026 A touch of vanilla? That could be heliotrope, too. The use of this gloriously purple-coloured plant in perfumery goes right the way back to Ancient Egypt. Technically, heliotrope can be still extracted by maceration (or through solvent extraction, the modern form of enfleurage), an echo of those times \u2013 but today it's synthetic heliotropin \u2013 which perfumers rely on. Heliotrope's teamed with violets and iris for a talcum-powdery, lipstick-esque sweetness \u2013 but as you may now have guessed, it's actually very versatile, becoming almost mouthwatering when used alongside bitter almond, each ingredient turbo-charging the other's marzipan-ish qualities. Put it with frangipani or vanilla, though, and their mutual sweetness comes out\u2026"
"Note: Hemlock -- \n\nHemlock is derived from the plant known botanically as Conium maculatum, which is notorious for its toxicity. Despite its dangerous attributes, hemlock has been explored as a fragrance note due to its unique and distinctive aromatic profile. The scent of hemlock is green, deeply earthy, and somewhat spicy, which makes it intriguing in the formulation of perfumes, particularly those that aim to evoke natural, wild landscapes or convey a sense of the forbidden. The history of hemlock in human culture is ancient and mostly infamous, primarily because of its use as a method of execution in ancient Greece, most notably in the death of the philosopher Socrates. In perfumery, its use is far more modern and considerably safer, focusing on capturing the aromatic elements of the plant without its toxic properties. Hemlock's fragrance is used to add depth and an element of mystery to a composition, often employed in small quantities to give a dark, green twist to fragrance bouquets. Hemlock notes in perfumery are typically synthetic due to the inherent risks associated with the plant's natural toxins. This allows perfumers to evoke the scent of hemlock safely, using a blend of aroma chemicals to mimic its clean, crisp, and slightly bitter green scent.\n"

Hibiscus is commonly utilized in floral and fruity fragrance families, adding a fresh, tropical touch to the compositions."
"Note: Holly -- Holly, primarily associated with its bright red berries and dark, glossy leaves, is a plant symbolically linked to winter and Christmas traditions. Scientifically known as Ilex aquifolium, holly is not traditionally known for its fragrance in the natural world but has been creatively interpreted in perfumery. The scent associated with holly in fragrances is often a blend of green, slightly sharp, and woody notes, imagined to evoke the crisp, vibrant atmosphere of a holly-adorned landscape in winter.\n\nThe use of holly as a fragrance note is quite innovative and modern, stemming from the desire to capture the essence of winter and the nostalgic sentiments tied to holiday decorations and themes. In perfumery, holly adds a fresh, green, and subtly spicy dimension, often complemented with other wintry notes like pine, cedar, and spices to enhance the festive feel.\n\nThe creation of a holly scent in perfumes is purely synthetic, as the actual plant does not yield an essential oil or extract that is usable in fragrances. This synthetic approach allows perfumers to idealize the scent, adding layers of imagination and seasonal charm to a fragrance."

Its inclusion in a fragrance can convey a sense of lushness, tranquility, and natural beauty. While the extraction of Hortensia's scent is not as straightforward as more traditional flowers, its essence is sometimes captured synthetically to bring its subtle floral notes to perfumes."
"Note: Hyacinth -- Hyacinth, one of spring's favourite flowers, gets its name from the Greek language: 'flower of rain'. There's a romantic Greek legend woven around hyacinth, actually: according to myth, the flower grew from the blood of Hyacinthus, a youth accidentally killed by Apollo.  In the world of perfumery, hyacinth displays an intensely sharp and multifaceted green floral note that can become more potent as the flower blooms. This unique fragrance has been used in various perfumes, such as Mugler Supra Floral and Penhaligon's The Revenge Of Lady Blanche.  Flower lovers began cultivating hyacinths more than 400 years ago. During the 18th century, they were the most popular spring bulbs in the world, and Dutch growers offered more than 2000 named cultivars.  Today, hyacinth compounds or their components are still used in cosmetic, toiletry and soap fragrances, but mostly as components of sophisticated fragrances adapted to the line."
"Note: Hyssop -- Hyssop, botanically known as Hyssopus officinalis, is used for its aromatic profile which offers a sweet, camphoraceous top note with a warm, spicy undertone, somewhat similar to lavender yet distinctly sharper.

The essential oil is obtained through steam distillation of the leaves and flowers, contributing to middle notes in perfumes, introducing a clean, bright, and slightly medicinal aspect to fragrance blends."
"Note: Ice -- In the context of perfumery, 'Ice' is not a literal ingredient but a conceptual term used to describe a scent note that evokes the sensation of coldness, freshness, and purity.

Perfumers create the impression of 'Ice' using various ingredients and aroma chemicals that contribute to a cooling, crisp, and clean scent. These can include notes like menthol, certain citrus elements, and other components that provide a sharp, fresh olfactory experience. The use of 'Ice' in fragrances is aimed at invoking the refreshing and invigorating qualities of cold environments, such as snow-capped mountains, frozen lakes, or the brisk air of winter mornings.

"Note: Icing -- Icing as a fragrance note is a delightful, whimsical addition to perfumery that captures the sweet, creamy essence of frosting.
