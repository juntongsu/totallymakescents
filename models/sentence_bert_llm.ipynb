It also has a green, herbaceous tone in it, which is probably courtesy of the basil. The fig note is also there underneath giving it a bit of creaminess, which made me realize that neroli and fig could make a really interesting and pleasant combination. I unfortunately haven\\'t smelled vetiver in isolation, hence I can\\'t comment on its contribution. \\\\nOverall, this is a really pleasant, likable and easy to wear scent that one can wear on a daily basis. It\\'s my approachable clean girl fragrance, lol...i really like it though.\", \\'It has a screechy opening that actually induces headaches. The dry down though is sweet - it could be the fig.\\', \\'I agree with the comment below.\\\\nThis one is really challenging. Way too sharp and green while the white floral aspect is subdued.\\\\nAlso this is nothing like Neroli Amara by VCA. Surely, they both have as a main note the neroli, but I find Nerolia Vetiver more complex and challenging because of the green and sharp quality it has.\\\\nNeroli Amara is fresh and citrusy, easy-going and more rounded scent. \\\\nFor me Nerolia Vetiver is not a safe blind buy.\\', \\'Oooh this is a tough one. I recognize it is beautiful because I can discern natural notes of neroli, vetiver and basil. But as a fragrance, it is not for me. I find it really sharp and masculine-leaning in the opening. It reminds me a lot of 4711 Eau De Cologne, but stronger. The drydown is more mellow, but soapy.\\', \"Vetiver and neroli are beautiful scents. If the usual vetiver scents are too prickly for you, you should try this Guerlain. Gentle, slightly soapy, unisex and a little creamy. It actually reminds me a little of Creed\\'s Vetiver. This perfume is a little insider tip.\", \\'I prefer this to the Forte or Harvest version, as those contain orange blossom, which Iâ\\x80\\x99m not a fan of, and make the neroli seem sweeter and less fresh. This has phenomenal performance, good longevity and projection for an EDT so I bought a 125 ml on sale. The fig in this smells like fig nectar.\\', \"I love this fresh green floral that is not sweet or cloying. I really enjoy the sharpness of the top neroli note, and find that it lasts a surprisingly long time for a this type of scent, or any Aqua Allegoria I\\'ve tried. Every time I wear it I ask myself why I don\\'t wear it more often!\", \\'I have this and each time I wear it I question if I like it, but then get addicted to sniffing it throughout the day. It smells clean, strongly of citrus, though it is a bit â\\x80\\x9cdryâ\\x80\\x9d of a smell (possibly the vetiver), with some inoffensive (quite pretty actually) florals and slight sweetness rounding things off. There is something bitter (if you could smell bitter!) in the opening. Maybe thatâ\\x80\\x99s why I always question whether I like it or not. Anyway, this isnâ\\x80\\x99t a perfume I choose to wear often, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad to have it, because it is very enjoyable in the summer. It smells very realistic, not fake or cloying. I also own 2 other Aqua Allegoria and I get the best performance and silage out of this one, about 5 hours on skin, 8 on clothing. I consider that very good for such a light, fresh, citrusy eau de toilette. Perfectly enjoyable, perfectly unisex.\\', \"There are some very strange \\'noses\\' and interpretations on this below.\\\\nI know we all have different noses, brains and body chemistry but come on, some of you are surely not smelling the same fragrance.\\\\nIt\\'s these wildly different and bizarre reviews that make this review section all pretty pointless. \\\\nCleaning product? Pledge? Same vetiver as Guerlain Vetiver? FFS.\", \\'The only one in the entire Aqua Allegoria range that actually has a hint of sweetness to it! What a lovely fragrance - ethereal, simply divine.\\', \\'To me the opening vetiver note smells alot like the vetiver in guerlian vetiver which I expected but overall smells alot like an aqua di Parma scent I donâ\\x80\\x99t hate it but itâ\\x80\\x99s a bit boring and generic and becomes redundant nothing too special about it\\', \\'I need this for summer. It is fresh, but not the usual boring citrus. It is soapy and clean. I could not imagine someone not liking it. My next purchase for sure.\\', \"I got a sample of this from a travelling sample box (EU) which is a very cool idea and is administered here in Fragrantica in one of the forum threads (under Perfume Splits and Member Giveaways). This was my nr. 1 finding among nearly 200 samples. I had searched for a green scent and didn\\'t even know what to look for. I had experiences with something extremely green before, like Demeter\\'s To Yo Ran Orchid and Dandelion which basically smell like cut flowers and cut grass (harsh green!), besides they were oil-based, leaving marks on clothes. Having smelt the sample of this was like a revelation: this is the one I want! I bought a full bottle immediately and wasn\\'t disappointed at all! Even though it has the same soapy ingredient -- whatever it is, like in Pierre Balmain\\'s Vent Vert, that I don\\'t enjoy that much -- I still like it a lot. I probably understand why this reminds many others some cleaning product: because of the soap smell here. But I personally haven\\'t used any such in the past and I don\\'t have such associations, I only generally recognise the soap that everybody knows. \\\\nRecently I went to a department store and smelt the other scents of the same Aqua Allegoria line. There weren\\'t all of them but about 6-7. I realised that Nerolia Vetiver is very different from the rest, there\\'s nothing sweet-smelling in this one. I don\\'t really know what is a niche scent but maybe this is one, even if the producer is not considered one. It is exactly for me, a green scent that is worth being named green and having a light green colour. \\\\nAlso, this scent was a revelation to me in the sense I realised by smelling a sample of another vetiver scent (which I ordered among other samples just because this scent had vetiver mentioned in the name and is very good) that vetiver is the ingredient I like most, at least in a certain category of scents to me. I had tried one neroli scent but it wasn\\'t that impressive, maybe I have to try more to understand what that is. Now I know where to head on to find other excellent scents among so many of them: they have to contain vetiver!\", \"I love neroli, I love vetiver, and despite having access to so many raw materials, I never thought to put these together. I LOVE mandarine basil, pamplune, bergamote ... I was sure I\\'d LOVE this so I bought a whole bottle, mostly because a 30 ml option was unavailable. My first reaction was very negative -- a muddy, compost-like terroir. It started giving me a headache, which was odd snce I was pretty sure it was one of the more natural offerings in the range. I thought about returning it, then thought I\\'d try layering it with other Aqua Allegoria scents and that helped to mellow it out. On future wears, I also made sure to walk into a spritz since I really couldn\\'t handle the scent of it applied directly. I regret buying it, but think it will be a helpful stop as I learn to step away from blending things with amber, oakmoss and/or labdanum all the time\", \\'Very nice. Soapy clean with a touch of sweetness. Smells relaxing and natural. Really unisex. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a good scent for hot days. Itâ\\x80\\x99s nothing groundbreaking but itâ\\x80\\x99s well blended.\\', \\'This is my least favourite in the aqua allegoria line. It flat out smells like laundry detergent powder, it induced a headache.\\', \"NEROLI CREAM. Not what I was expecting, but this is gorgeous. I just have a tester spray, but I get the neroli & vetiver, but the fig note is actually more of a buttercream monoi oil that smells like tiare on the skin and gives it a beachy facet that altogether could read as vintage white-floral for some. In the air I get the neroli more, but softer and sweeter than usual, along with a fruity aspect from the vetiver. If you\\'re looking for that punchy, sharp citrus cleaness like Neroli Portofino Tom Ford, this isn\\'t the same thing, it\\'s something different. But if you spray Neroli Portofino Tom Ford and Jardins de Bagatelle Guerlain side by side you would be in the ballpark for the first hour-and-a-half, although this is well blended. The neroli doesn\\'t last too long in that sharply clean way but fades into a creamier ghostly pale-green version of itself, while the vetiver and buttercream keep it alive for several hours. A few hours in, I get a soft pale-green & faintly citrus scent that reads like a green-tea scent to my nose and more similar to Aqua Allegoria Bergamote Calabria Guerlain. It\\'s a love for me. Enjoy!\", \"If you like Neroli Portofino or even the original 4711 - go for it. For me it\\'s just too much neroli which I don\\'t like in perfumes. The color of the juice is soothing. Even the forte version of this is nice.\", \"I love it. But I\\'m not difficult, I love neroli and vetiver in general. And even that little bit of green fig leaf I smell is adorable. Men should love this too. But, it\\'s June and over 30*C and I oversprayed it because it\\'s what you do with Allegoria stuff...it was gone in 15 minutes. Not even the original 4711 does that.\\\\nI did wore it before, in early spring, end of winter and I got 3-4 h without problem.\\\\nI will try the Forte version, but I\\'m not a bit fan of tonka in summer, it\\'s too heavy.  \\\\nAnd I\\'m pissed at new prices, Aqua Allegorias are eau de colognes at their best, except maybe Mandarine Basilic. They decided to make even more money. Well, it works for Tom Ford, everyday freshies are so ridiculously overpriced that only fragrance snobs and crazy enthousiasts buy them over and over. \\\\nFrashies work great in heath, you spray or dab or whatever every few hours. That\\'s the point of eau de colognes! That\\'s what they were made for! And that\\'s why they are reasonably priced! Or they should be!\", \\'Couldnâ\\x80\\x99t love it more. It gets a lot of hate but then why is it always sold out ? Hmmm. I tried all the aquas and truly like each I think they are simple and elegant and very reasonable priced. I loved this though I can smell each note yes but they blend into this seamless concoction that gives expensive green frangranced sunscreen. No tropical banna boat vibes here (which hey they have their place! ). It reminds me of a soap at hotel cote de cap. Incredibly and distinctly European maybe even Mediterranean bc of the basil and fig. Definitely a summer frag. But honestly this could work nicely with fresh snow, a clean white juxtaposition. Doesnâ\\x80\\x99t last an eternity but impressive for an EDT. If the EDP has lasting power thinking of making this my half year signature.\\', \\'A weak & generic green scent...go for the Forte\\', \\'Soapy coconut with grassy herbal elements . Some white florals . Gives me a tanning lotion vibe . I would not want to smell like this\\', \\'Smells great and so well blended unlike any other harsh nerolis you find left and right. I get whiffs of bright greenery along with a gentle but prominent neroli. Fresh vetiver backbone makes this even more fun and solidifies it as a warm weather staple. Longevity is questionable, I do get anosmic to it after wearing it a little while.\\', \"If you like this but can\\'t afford it, try the og 4711. Similar and affordable.\", \\'Really stands out among all the neroli dominated perfumes on the market!  \\\\nOpens with a lovely sweet neroli!!! It stands out with the earthy vetiver and juicy mouthwatering fig joined in!!! So good I usually hate fig in EVERY perfume~ but Guerlainâ\\x80\\x99s fig accord is the one that I can really appreciate it! The dry down is where the magic starts really like the earthy vetiver it balances with the sweet neroli and stopped the neroli to be so cloying which it often makes me headache with neroli dominated perfume\\', \\'Wow, what a beautiful scent!\\', \"I tried it for the Neroli, which is beautiful but very short-lived, but fell in love with this scent for the darker dry-down. It\\'s completely unexpected and is very sexy.\", \"For about 15 minutes I thought this was going to be the exceptional neroli that didn\\'t turn to cigarette ash on me. Nope, it\\'s faint but at the 15 minute mark I started to smell the acrid scent of ashes. I\\'m so disappointed, because until that point it was a gorgeous fresh scent. I get the same ash note from Nerolia Portofino and Escale a Portofino.\", \"This is a fresh, green scent which reminds me of holidays in Italy. You could easily share a bottle with your spouse, because it\\'s not completely male or female. It\\'s nice!\", \"I recently tried Nerolia Vetiver\\\\xa0by\\\\xa0Guerlain at Sephora. It\\'s such a beautiful floral neroli scent. In the opening, the neroli note is more pronounced. I really like Guerlain\\'s neroli note for being crisp and sparkling. In a few minutes the neroli\\'s prominence is behind us and in the dry down we have a very nice fresh floral scent. I think the scent is rounded off by a mellow vetiver note and to less extent the fig note. \\\\nOverall it is a pleasant fresh floral that is unisex but slightly leans on the feminine side. I prefer this for day wear during warmer months.\", \"I\\'ve been sampling this, and I can say Nerolia Vetiver has gone into the top of my list of amongst my favourite Aqua Allegorias. Just as its name implies, on myself Nerolia Vetiver is a superb blend of neroli and vetiver. The floral aspect is beautiful and most prevailing during the first hour, with some woody background. As time progresses, the composition slowly transforms towards the impression of bitter leaves and stems done in a wonderful way. The aroma is tender but present. Even though it\\'s not mentioned in the composition, there is something soft like a delicate powdery feel, very Guerlain style. It exudes elegance and grace.  \\\\nIt reminds me of Bvlgari Eau ThÃ© Vert, but with way better performance. Nerolia Vetiver lasts at least 6 hours on me (which is great for an Aqua Allegoria), while Eau ThÃ© Vert sadly only about 10 minutes. At some stages it also reminds me of Dior Pure Poison, though I greatly prefer Nerolia Vetiver. Pure Poison ends up with an ugly synthetic drydown on myself, while Nerolia Vetiver stays beautiful throughout its transformations throughout the hours.\", \\'I have been searching for this scent for a long time! It is a reminder of younger days but without smelling juvenile. This is summer in a bottle for me! Fresh, floral but soft- not harsh or loud. Itâ\\x80\\x99s classy yet casual. I get a bit of a gardenia vibe from the combination of notes. I imagine wearing this with a sundress in the hot weather! Definitely one to add to my buy list!\\', \"It\\'s a good fresh scent, very light and clean at first, more feminine leaning and pure poisony after few minutes. \\\\nPerfect for an elegant old lady (which I plan to be, but not now) or a young bride.\", \\'This is the second Allegoria that gets my attention; first one is Nettare di Sole (which I wore on a city trip to Valecia; perfect match!). On the way back, at the airport, I came across the one.\\\\nAt first sniff, I got an instant flasback... this reminds me so much of Trussardi Skin that I used to have years ago... Never before came across a \"dupe\" until now. It\\\\\\'s not quite identical but definitely close! Smells green/yellow to me, much like the Trussardi bottle!\\\\nI definitely like it a lot, hope to buy a full size one day. I would prefer this perfume for summer though. It\\\\\\'s happy and uplifting.\\', \"Beautiful, simple and refreshing. This would be the freshie to end all freshies for me if BV Tonka Solaire wasn\\'t taking that spot already. I think it reminds me a more high quality version of Rare Pearls (maybe thats why this is reminding some people of pure poison) even though I havent smelled it in a while, I feel like I\\'ve definitely worn something similar in my teens.\", \\'I like it, very refreshing and unique. No reason not to wear it on a nice autumn/winter day too.\\', \"Beautifully simple and transparent white floral. The opening of this fragrance is a sharp and bright neroli with green basil dancing around it. As it warms up the sweetness of the fig and the dirty, earthy, slightly spicy vetiver come through and marry with the neroli and basil to make a beautifully light and refreshing yet grounded scent. Something about this takes me right to summer days. I can\\'t wait for the spring and summer to enjoy this is the sun and heat.\", \\'To me, it smels like pure poison, by dior.\\', \\'I could have written the recipe for this myself! All of my favourite ingredients at last in one fragrance! As soon as I discovered this existed, I showered, slopped on unscented deodorant, sunscreen and body lotion and schlepped off down to the shops to find it. That was a chore, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you! I braved a â\\x80\\x9crain eventâ\\x80\\x9d that is covering most of Australia and going in a circle that is â\\x80\\x9cdefinitely not a cycloneâ\\x80\\x9d to schniff this juice. It wore well for at least eight hours, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve already informed my dearest husband what Santa might like to put on top of the Christmas list as Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been a very good girl this year.\\', \"I received a complimentary mini bottle from Guerlain. I don\\'t know what to think. This is such a rare scent. It smells very green but not bright green. It smells a little bit grey. It is not a happy and uplifting scent. This is a smoky vetiver, with a very harsh neroli in the beginning, later there is this sweetness coming from the fig leaves and fig pulp, it is a little bit spicy, almost like...if the figs had a bit of cinnamon sugar.\\\\nI don\\'t know. It is interesting but not my cup of tea. Probably on a man it would be great.\", \"The scent is fresh and invigorating but somehow there\\'s a faint sweetness I can\\'t get enough of. At first it is a bit sharp, and turns sweeter over time and I can smell more and more of the figs. If you spray too much the sharpness can be overwhelming like a cleaning product as some have said, but when sprayed in moderation it almost smells ~expensive~ and ~high class~. Makes me feel like a model, like a woman in dark shades, dressed in a sleek, unisex designer suit. I don\\'t wear perfume heavily as I have a sensitive nose so this is just right for me.\", \\'Lately Iâ\\x80\\x99ve immersed myself in all things Guerlain, especially Mon Guerlain and itâ\\x80\\x99s many sweet vanilla based flankers. This is the antithesis of Mon Guerlain. \\\\nThe first spray is a rather harsh Neroli, wood and citrus. Very unisex. Very un-sweet. My first impression was it was nothing I would wear. But as it warmed on my skin, I warmed to it and changed my mind. I like to wear a scent for all occasions, and this would be perfect for outdoors and exercise. A whiff of this on a hike would be invigorating. After an hour it has become a warm wood - floral skin scent. Pleasant. Still not sure if I would spent the money for a bottle.\\', \\'I love both Neroli and Vetiver so I was very excited when this came out. Until I tested it, such a disappointment. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a very citrusy Neroli, Vetiver is only somewhere in the background and the end result is a boring low performance summer scent. Donâ\\x80\\x99t waste your money.\\', \\'Sharp bitter citrus. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not a huge citrus fan so not for me, but it may be someone elseâ\\x80\\x99s cup of tea.\\', \"Stuff is great. Bright, juicy, green, neroli and fig leaf. Fresh and clean and uplifting, grassy. It\\'s beautiful.\", \"Nice, well balanced and refined fragrance in its semplicity. The neroli is the main protagonist here. Unlike other reviews, at my nose the vetiver is quite prominent, creating the perfect base for beautiful neroli. Basically, it is all about the duo neroli and -half strp behind- vetiver. It does not evolve so much, maybe the vetiver unfolds a bit more with the time, whereas the neroli looses a bit its citrusy facet and the sharpness. I don\\'t pick up precisely basilic, but I think contribuites to an idea of greeness. Fig is the big absent to me, thus there isn\\'t any note adding sweetness to contrastate the sharpness and bitterness of the neroli. To my nose, this is an added value, I am tired of sweetness everywhere, moreover neroli and vetiver are amongst my fav notes, so it is nice to see them as protagonists! I guess, however, this is also the reson why some comments say \\'old lady\\' and \\' scrubber\\'. The scents does not project much, but linger quite at lot close to the skin, for this kind of product. It is nice? Yes, very nice. It is unique? No. To be honest there are also good neroli edt in lower cost brand. Thus, as it is sold at full price in physical shops is overpriced (sorry, I love Guerlain, but the brand\\'s name alone is not a good justification for over priced products like this), but with a good sale online could be considered.\", \"Beautiful aroma! Well this deserves much higher rating! I\\'m amazed of some of the bad descriptions below. \\\\nToilet cleaner? Artificial lemony soap? Old lady.... Jesus! Probably because you like completely different scents and don\\'t understand Neroli nor vetiver. \\\\nIf you can\\'t see the soft sophisticated beauty in this scent and call it artificial, I think you should stay far away from Neroli. The Neroli here is creamy, discreet and well blended with the other notes, I can smell the fig which give a touch of sweetness and traces of basil/vetiver. The vetiver is clean and barely noticeable and this is why many people would like this much more than other vetiver scents. I\\'\\'m actually surprised that the named it Nerolia Vetiver... I would have chosen to name it perhaps Nerolia Fig instead. Like someone else said, I also get the feeling of orange-blossom in this composition, because of the fruity creaminess it has compared to dry bitter Neroli heavy scents. And yes, in the drydown I can also see a touch of luxurious sunscrren.\\\\nBUT, the scent is kind of week and on me it became a skin scent within 30 minutes at first test, maybe I got a bit noseblind due to sticking my nose to close too fast... \\\\nI totally agree with some reviewers below: \\\\n-Unisex. Maybe slightly feminine leaning. Great for summer days. Fresh and uplifting. You get Neroli then juicy fig and clean and soapy vetiver. Maybe Basil in the background.\\\\n-Wow, this is such an elegant summer fragrance! I perceive neroli, and even some orange blossom, to be the most prominent notes.\\\\nBTW I like this soo much better than Herba fresca which to me is really feminin, and the herbs and toothpaste feeling was a bit to much really. I swaped to this and I\\'m lucky that i discovered a new summer favorite.\\\\nI will say, that I\\'m a big fan of Ferrari Bright Neroli also, that\\'s why I like this I guess. This is weeker but more sophisticated and cleaner than Bright Neroli.\\\\nSummary: You must appreciate neroli/ orangeblossom/fig to like this one :)\", \\'Great for layering as wel just like the mandarin basil one . Itâ\\x80\\x99s really similar to that one . Itâ\\x80\\x99s make every sent beter more luxe . When I layer it with la vie est belle you get a fragrance between miss Dior 2017 and scandal by night . It makes a fragrance more citrus but in a warm and comforting way , and you can smell the vetiver .\\', \"Somehow I thought it is going to be somewhere like Limone Verde with its fig and neroli notes but is completely something different and more closer to Herba Fresca with its dry fresh nonsweet aroma. \\\\nWhat I get is a blast of neroli which I\\'m crazy for, and vetiver which I\\'m learning to love with the help of this frag. \\\\nNo sweetness, no prettiness, it\\'s kind of hard core fresh dry grassy neroli vetiver. \\\\nThe dry down is gentle fresh vetiver that is a bit manly, but i think it is because I associate vetiver with manly frags. \\\\nSomewhere in the middle I can catch of something fruity and figgy that hides in the structure but, this release is focused on neroli and vetiver just as it says on the bottle. \\\\nOverall it is not trying to be likable, it is old classic vibes with modern construction, dry fresh airy soapy that sings a beautiful vetiver aura in the drydown, and it last quite some time. \\\\nNot a drop of mainstream here, just a fabulous creation for those who love it. \\\\nUpdate: after wearing it a while I learned to recognize the fig note, the dry down is vetiver with semisweet fig. Gorgeous drydown..\", \\'Smells like a grandma in the middle of a humid summer. I just donâ\\x80\\x99t understand this one maybe lol. Itâ\\x80\\x99s way too mature & soapy.\\', \\'Itâ\\x80\\x99s a big difference how this parfum smells in skin then paper. On paper is more neroli / fruity, but on my skin is fig tea to me very similar to Jo Malone black tea and cucumber. Also they say â\\x80\\x9cingredients from natural origin â\\x80\\x9c and many people are confuse and think itâ\\x80\\x99s natural, ingredients from natural origin is not the same with natural extract. I think this is just a business think for Guerlain to justify somehow the high\\\\nprince for this weak and short lasting tea parfum\\', \\'The reviewer wst below nailed it. I can just add that it is surprisingly long-lasting for an Aqua Allegoria. Projection is rather mild but fits this type of scent. Well done, Guerlain! It is just regretable that the Aqua Allegorias get quickly discontinued (I would like to have Passiflora and Teazzura back!). So if you really like one stock up, it might not be available anymore next year.\\', \"Received a sample with an online purchase. Vile, articificial lemony aroma reminiscent of cheap soap. Guerlain what ever happened - is it cost cutting or am I the only person who doesn\\'t want to smell of toilet cleaner?\", \\'I like it. Unisex. Maybe slightly feminine leaning. Great for summer days. Fresh and uplifting. You get Neroli then juicy fig and clean and soapy vetiver. Maybe Basil in the background.\\', \"The first spray gives me Nettare di Sole vibes, I can smell a sunscreen undertone that must be the fig although I wouldn\\'t be able to identify it as such if I hadn\\'t read the notes. The basil is pungent and spoils the pleasant vetiver/neroli combination. Very underwhelming to my nose and a total pass as it gave me an inmediate headache and sinus issues.\", \\'I am a devotee of classic Guerlain fragrances, and bought one of those. I received a sample of this AA along with my purchase. I have concluded that Thierry Wasser is not my cup of tea. I have sniffed his â\\x80\\x9cCherry Bombâ\\x80\\x9d, which goes under the name of â\\x80\\x9cPetite Robe Noireâ\\x80\\x9d in some jurisdictions. I can douse myself in Cherry Coke for far less expense and get a more subtle effect. \\\\nThis Nerolia Vetiver is exceptionally frustrating, because one can detect that the ingredients are high quality. But the overall effect is high end hotel shampoo. A sickly sweet showoff smell. After dry down, it is less sweet, but some kind of sweaty funk appears. The overall effect is juvenile and nasty. I need to scrub it off.\\', \\'Wow, this is such an elegant summer fragrance! I perceive neroli, and even some orange blossom, to be the most prominent notes, followed by vetiver. Fig and basil stay in the background and add to the allure. I definitely see the resemblance to 4711 Original Eau de Cologne, but Nerolia Vetiver is a bit sweeter and less citrusy sharp. When I smelled this fragrance for the first time, I was immediately transported back to the Amalfi coast and Ischia at sunset time. I think this is a must-try for lovers of cologne scents! \\\\nSo, it is a few days later and I have just visited a Guerlain counter where the sales associate sprayed Nerolia Vetiver together with Epices Exquises to demonstrate that Epices Exquises could also be suitable for a summer eveningâ\\x80¦. and I must say that this combination is really beautiful! It transforms Nerolia Vetiver into a woodier composition while bringing the fig note to the forefront.\\', \\'HUMMMMM!!!!! UN VRAI DELICE FRAIS PROPRE. ON SENT BIEN LE NEROLI ET EN MEME TEMPS LE VETIVERT.JENE SENT PAS DE FIGUE. J AI TESTE L ECHANTILLON VAIS COMMANDER LES 75ML CAR RAFRAICHIT PENDANT LES FORTES CHALEURS. A ACHETER SANS SOUCIS EN BUY BLIND\\', \\'This is one of the better from Aqua Allegoria. I can identify the neroli note but could not seem to smell any of the other listed notes (fig/basil/vetiver) at all. It smells like some laundry or toilet cleaning products and, frankly, a bit old fashioned. Rather sweet and warm. More suitable for the evening.\\', \"I don\\'t think this smells like Promenade des Anglais as a scent overall, but the fig accord definitely smells like it\\'s plucked from that scent. Rather than the fig taking center stage with iris, like in that scent, an herbal and semi-sweet neroli is front and center and the sweet, creamy, green fig accord hums along in the background. I smell basil, crushed leaves and greenery, a bit of citrus, and the aforementioned orange blossom. Vetiver is actually not super prominent to me. Ionones/violet add body but not powder. A really nice scent that I\\'m going to enjoy refreshing frequently throughout the summer. In terms of longevity--the main fireworks of the scent are brief...but the next morning, the place where I sprayed it still had a beautiful residue of sharp, sweet neroli and some of the green, herby fig.\", \\'Starts great, ends meh like everything of the line. The fig note is prominent in the drydown\\', \\'Wearing a sample today. It starts off quite herbal and dries down to be a bit sweeter, slightly floral/musky. I could smell it on myself for the first few hours but by 5/6 hours itâ\\x80\\x99s a skin scent. I enjoyed this one, smells clean, great for a Spring day, not overpowering. Will think about getting a bottle.\\', \\'After spraying this made me happy because it gives me a sunny beach vibe. Not like Sel Marin, but bright and clear. Later on the musc comes up joined by white florals and a slightly bitter green, very pleasant. However, after this fase it becomes more and more soapy and this lasts for hours. And although very nice, soapy is not my thing.\\', \\'On the first spray : Â«\\\\xa0WAOUH\\\\xa0Â». I need the biggest bottle i can found, i think this will be my next summer signature scent.\\\\nIn the opening, it smells like a bar soap in the best way possible and the dry down is a unisex type fresh floral i would say.

Nerolia Vetiver is just different from most of the other recent releases (no citrus, no obvious fruit, no \"solar\" nor \"aquatic\" notes thank God) and to me seems like an overdue return to the heart of what the Aqua Allegoria range is supposed to smell like: nature. \\\\nThis is a slightly paradoxical scent because to me it is vegetal, floral and the key adjective I would use is \"balm-like\". It smells cooling and soothing but is not acidic or fresh like a citrus, rather more like plant sap or dew. It\\\\\\'s not particularly feminine or overtly floral, but the neroli and vetiver blend to create this soothing, serene scent which reminds me of smooth pebbles in a gently running stream. It\\\\\\'s calming, it\\\\\\'s unisex, it\\\\\\'s natural-smelling and it has surprising character for such a brief notes list. I can\\\\\\'t smell any fig at all and the basil is hiding if it is there, but I think these notes just contribute to the greener half of the scent, with the neroli filling in the space with its white, cloud-like uplift. \\\\nThis is not miles away from most other colognes/ green scents I can think of but this is actually far better than most of them (in my honest opinion). Longevity, like most AAs, is not considerable but you will get strong projection for an hour and then a soft aura for another three or four hours. If you\\\\\\'re someone who likes Aqua Allegorias in general you will enjoy this, and I\\\\\\'m glad to see Guerlain slow down a little and make something really very lovely.\\', \\'So sad!

Not sure why name say Divine, rather I can imagine woman\\'s apartment with clean wood furniture in background. Somewhat unique, maybe because it\\'s bit old fashion scent since this is from 2000\\'s, but it\\'s inoffensive, still interesting and wearable. At first it smells quite terrible, but wait some 10 minutes for it to develop. More time passes more softer and cheap fruity-floral it gets.

I really love Divine fresh and clean smell, but sadly it\\'s only last 2 hours on my skin, while if it\\'s on clothes could last about 4 hours. I like to wear this perfume right after shower in the morning, it gives a feeling like you enter a spring garden full of white flowers. But, yeah... it\\'s not long lasting, you should respray it again after 2 or 3 hours to keep the silage there. I like the bottle, kinda sexy curve, but not so travel friendly as it is quite tall bottle for such a tiny make up pouch. Overall, this perfume is something I can wear everyday during the day time, or before going to sleep. But it\\'s less prominent for an evening special occasion. Repurchase? Of course, as I wear this quite often for daily use.\", \"This is a very weak, watery scent. A few minutes after initially applying it to my wrists, I could barely smell it on my skin, but the sillage is better - I get wafts of it every now and again, with different notes emerging as it develops. \\\\nDivine is a simple, clean floral scent with a hint of fruity sweetness. Fresh, green, watery white florals make up Divine, with a squeeze of natural fruit juice. Freesia is the most prominent note to my nose, and water hyacinth (a note I haven\\'t smelled before, but judging from its description) is a close second. It is aquatic, slightly aromatic and green. Bamboo adds a very light, green woodiness, complementing the other notes nicely. The drydown is musky as the aquatic florals fade. I do get a hint of plum in the base too. Longevity is short-lived and sillage is intimate-to-moderate while it lasts. \\\\nLinear, fresh and extremely subtle, this scent has no sharp edges (unlike, for example, D&G Light Blue). Discreet and softly feminine, it would likely suit people who don\\'t like strong scent. For summer days. Too weak for my taste, but not bad. 2/5.\", \"It\\'s such a clean, sophisticated floral scent. At first, it can come off as a little bit strong but in the dry down, it\\'s very pleasant, sensual, and cozy.\", \\'This is so watered-down. Simple floral smell imo. Not overly sweet. Not overly anything. Just light. Non-offensive, turns into a skin scent fast. Takes quite a bit for the perfume alcohol smell to go away.

Old not as is no. 5 but as in Lady Million, Flora Gucci, Lancome Hypnose. Nonetheless, it is a well done perfume of violets, bright fresh notes and something really interesting, the bamboo I guess.

I like them both. However, the EDP is lighter and crispier and thus, more suitable for all day round wear.

Something you\\\\'d buy at any street market somewhere in Asia/South America (too bad we do not have a lively street market in the USA). If you want a nice and long lasting amber on a budget, go for Frank Olivier Amber. Black Oud has a soft projection for about an hour, then it sits close to skin for another 3-4 hours. I get a very, very faint oud in the drydown, but you gotta know what oud smells like to identify it. Cheap blind buy but not worth my money, in my opinion.', \\\"A new fave, blind acquired based on reviews here. This fragrance makes me never want to pay more than $20 for a scent ever again! Quality and performance of this 'cheapie' suit me better than all of the spendy niche ouds I have been considering (Montale, Roja, Nasomatto, Guerlain). A true oud, complete with acrid medicinal bite in the opening, Monotheme Black Oud mellows out to a politely wearable cool woody floral experience, light and clean where other perfumes bearing similar name and notes tend to be overbearingly dark and tarry. This is the only oud perfume I have tried (other than TF Oud Minerale, which hardly qulifies) that I would consider bringing out in warm Spring and Autumn weather. In the absence of any funky horse barn cast or overtly synthetic spoilers, the bitter oud note blends pleasantly with sandalwood, smoke, spices, and rose, lending the composition the faintest tinge of edgy danger, without the risk of rolling over into a body odor situation. On its own, this fragrance is elegant, subtle and yet distinctive for mature wearers of all genders. As an under layer, it successfully adds depth and niche-like performance quality to lighter fruit, citrus, aromatic, fougere, and floral perfumes. For mixology purposes, this will supercede my Demeter Oud, which smells more like black truffle in comparison. Definitely recommended for those who love both a good oud perfume and a great value.\\\", \\\"I found that one on price of 9 euros so I said.. Oud with 9 euros how good can it be? So it's reaaally good! I had compliments from the first time I wear it and everybody thought that it was expensive oudy fragrance! Sweet ambery oud great for cold nights and only 9 euros! Also good longevity and sillage! If you find it just buy it! It worths a lot more!\\\", \\\"REVIEW | 100 ml purchased from M&S \\\\nExcellente!!! ...as they say at the Ambassadors party. ;) \\\\nI blind bought this from M&S for only \\u00c2\\u00a317.00. On first spray I was quite taken aback by how good it smells. It really reminds me of Penhaligon's Cairo on first spray, it settles down really nicely too, but diverges from Cairo to nearer Guerlain's Oud Essentiel, in fact the mid/dry down is almost identical to Oud Essentiel. Considering that Cairo is about ten times the price of this you'd be churlish to complain about value for money. \\\\nProjection wise, it's not totally in your face but still pretty good. I do get exceptionally good longevity with it - though I'm not sure if that's attributable to my particular skin PH factor or the batch of the bottle I purchased. In fact, I was so pleased with it's performance that I bought another bottle.\\\", \\\"I heard good things about this so blind bought due the the lack of a tester in M & S Bristol. I wish I hadn't. Weak performer so much so its not worth the investment. Really dissapointed. As too the smell difficult to say as it sits so close to the skin. I would say there is a a problem with this fragrance. Just so you know my batch is 1356081. \\\\nupdate.....once i had regained my composure... a very light oud with some floral powdery notes but really poor performance very little projection\\\", \\\"The top is the best. Too bad it doesn't last long.

This past year has been the 50th anniversary of the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cStonewall Riots\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\\\n4. His partner, Francis Menuge, died of AIDS 30 years ago this year.\\\\n5.

Majority of people who buy this are club kids and dads/wives for their husbands. \\\\n8. JPG is the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cEnfant Terrible\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d for being an expressionist and accepting nonconformative beauty, which is a lot to do with why Le Male was popular in the gay community, including lesbians (Classique wasn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t associated with the gay community). It\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s appropriate for such a significant fragrance that was very much intertwined to the gay community to be sporting a rainbow flag.\\\\n9. Fragrance is a form of expression and LM is still a top 10 fragrance in most countries, which gives the statement a large visual platform to spread recognition. Even if the Ltd Ed bottle doesn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t sell, it makes a statement about the brand and face. When conservative societies see this scent as a cult classic, such as those in the UAE, and acknowledge most designers are gay, but still choose to wear their fashions due to style and popularity, I don\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t think they\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll make a big fuss over knowing that JPG launched a bottle with a pride flag. \\\\n************* \\\\nIndividuals who are skeptical to wear Le Male due to insecurities about sexuality, aren\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t skeptical of Le Male alone, but fragrance in general. Over the years of being in the industry, those individuals are afraid of wearing anything that they find may be too feminine. These individuals are more prone to wearing Axe deodorant as their fragrance of choice and avoid traditional/designer fragrance in general. \\\\nMovements such as gay rights, women\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s equality and black rights are still prevalent wotj different severity in different regions, because they\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re still a major issue. Movements will gain and lose traction, but as long as the inequality exists, things such as this Ltd Ed are still relevant.

If ever there was a brand and particular product for which it seems appropriate it's this one. I can only imagine the reactions if something like Greed Aventus or Dior Sausage came out in rainbow flags. For that I would grab a bag of popcorn and watch the online meltdown.  \\\\nFor Le M\\u00c3\\u00a2le it seems to make sense, let's be honest love it or loathe it, the bottle is so iconic that no matter the colour scheme or 'dressing' it's going to be a collector's item.  \\\\nAs for the scent, seems it's going to be the same, not really my kind of scent but I respect it as a real show-stopping fragrance, instantly recognisable, somehow compelling (even to me) and hugely influential. The lavender, mint, orange blossom and vanilla quartet are really something else here, extremely powerful stuff and a landmark release. Chapeau monsieur JPG (and Kurkdjian of course).\\\", 'no perfume fits this design better. why so many negative comments? le male was perhaps the first modern perfume metrosexual.io will buy the bottle. is beautiful.\\\\nwhy so many negative performance ratings? the juice is always the same.', 'Must admit I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m surprised at the level of hate for this bottle.

You get to live with that.', \\\"Please keep your fragile masculinity (like a glass slipper) inside your home. This is just a commemorative bottle made only and only for those who want to buy. Your opinions about the fragrance could already be in the original bottle. No gay man went there to requisition the sailor's sexuality. kisses of light!\\\", \\\"I'm just here to add this is fantastic! I have/had vintage JPG bottles from the 90's and 00's and this right here makes them redundant - not even kidding. I purposely sought this formulation out (Puig/France, I think? Would have to check my bottle at home) and it's excellent. It's Le Male through and through as far as I'm concerned. If you don't want to hunt vintage Le Male, then this is it. Snag a bottle!\\\", \\\"I love it. Custom bottle and tin can. This is half the price of Le Male in the OG bottle, but its the same juice. No-brainer buy!  \\\\nToo many insecure men offended by a mere rainbow, while all their favorite designers are gay themselves. It's appalling.\\\", 'When is it going to be over JPG? Nothing against Pride month of the LGBTQ community, my younger brother is gay and I love him so much and I respect other people\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s choices because everyone deserves happiness and love. \\\\nThis is about putting the same juice or tweaked it a little and then change the color of the torso bottle, use a different flanker name and then market it as something different or unique. \\\\nPlease give us something really new and exciting to wear. I am so tired of this formula, it was great and I enjoyed it for more than 10 years and I thank you for that, but I think it\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s time for something new. \\\\nMake something from scratch even the iconic torso bottle needs to retire (just take a hiatus) for a few years.', 'Not a good fragrance. Loud but in an obnoxious way.
