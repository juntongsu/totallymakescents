It also has a green, herbaceous tone in it, which is probably courtesy of the basil. The fig note is also there underneath giving it a bit of creaminess, which made me realize that neroli and fig could make a really interesting and pleasant combination. I unfortunately haven\\'t smelled vetiver in isolation, hence I can\\'t comment on its contribution. \\\\nOverall, this is a really pleasant, likable and easy to wear scent that one can wear on a daily basis. It\\'s my approachable clean girl fragrance, lol...i really like it though.\", \\'It has a screechy opening that actually induces headaches. The dry down though is sweet - it could be the fig.\\', \\'I agree with the comment below.\\\\nThis one is really challenging. Way too sharp and green while the white floral aspect is subdued.\\\\nAlso this is nothing like Neroli Amara by VCA. Surely, they both have as a main note the neroli, but I find Nerolia Vetiver more complex and challenging because of the green and sharp quality it has.\\\\nNeroli Amara is fresh and citrusy, easy-going and more rounded scent. \\\\nFor me Nerolia Vetiver is not a safe blind buy.\\', \\'Oooh this is a tough one. I recognize it is beautiful because I can discern natural notes of neroli, vetiver and basil. But as a fragrance, it is not for me. I find it really sharp and masculine-leaning in the opening. It reminds me a lot of 4711 Eau De Cologne, but stronger. The drydown is more mellow, but soapy.\\', \"Vetiver and neroli are beautiful scents. If the usual vetiver scents are too prickly for you, you should try this Guerlain. Gentle, slightly soapy, unisex and a little creamy. It actually reminds me a little of Creed\\'s Vetiver. This perfume is a little insider tip.\", \\'I prefer this to the Forte or Harvest version, as those contain orange blossom, which Iâ\\x80\\x99m not a fan of, and make the neroli seem sweeter and less fresh. This has phenomenal performance, good longevity and projection for an EDT so I bought a 125 ml on sale. The fig in this smells like fig nectar.\\', \"I love this fresh green floral that is not sweet or cloying. I really enjoy the sharpness of the top neroli note, and find that it lasts a surprisingly long time for a this type of scent, or any Aqua Allegoria I\\'ve tried. Every time I wear it I ask myself why I don\\'t wear it more often!\", \\'I have this and each time I wear it I question if I like it, but then get addicted to sniffing it throughout the day. It smells clean, strongly of citrus, though it is a bit â\\x80\\x9cdryâ\\x80\\x9d of a smell (possibly the vetiver), with some inoffensive (quite pretty actually) florals and slight sweetness rounding things off. There is something bitter (if you could smell bitter!) in the opening. Maybe thatâ\\x80\\x99s why I always question whether I like it or not. Anyway, this isnâ\\x80\\x99t a perfume I choose to wear often, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad to have it, because it is very enjoyable in the summer. It smells very realistic, not fake or cloying. I also own 2 other Aqua Allegoria and I get the best performance and silage out of this one, about 5 hours on skin, 8 on clothing. I consider that very good for such a light, fresh, citrusy eau de toilette. Perfectly enjoyable, perfectly unisex.\\', \"There are some very strange \\'noses\\' and interpretations on this below.\\\\nI know we all have different noses, brains and body chemistry but come on, some of you are surely not smelling the same fragrance.\\\\nIt\\'s these wildly different and bizarre reviews that make this review section all pretty pointless. \\\\nCleaning product? Pledge? Same vetiver as Guerlain Vetiver? FFS.\", \\'The only one in the entire Aqua Allegoria range that actually has a hint of sweetness to it! What a lovely fragrance - ethereal, simply divine.\\', \\'To me the opening vetiver note smells alot like the vetiver in guerlian vetiver which I expected but overall smells alot like an aqua di Parma scent I donâ\\x80\\x99t hate it but itâ\\x80\\x99s a bit boring and generic and becomes redundant nothing too special about it\\', \\'I need this for summer. It is fresh, but not the usual boring citrus. It is soapy and clean. I could not imagine someone not liking it. My next purchase for sure.\\', \"I got a sample of this from a travelling sample box (EU) which is a very cool idea and is administered here in Fragrantica in one of the forum threads (under Perfume Splits and Member Giveaways). This was my nr. 1 finding among nearly 200 samples. I had searched for a green scent and didn\\'t even know what to look for. I had experiences with something extremely green before, like Demeter\\'s To Yo Ran Orchid and Dandelion which basically smell like cut flowers and cut grass (harsh green!), besides they were oil-based, leaving marks on clothes. Having smelt the sample of this was like a revelation: this is the one I want! I bought a full bottle immediately and wasn\\'t disappointed at all! Even though it has the same soapy ingredient -- whatever it is, like in Pierre Balmain\\'s Vent Vert, that I don\\'t enjoy that much -- I still like it a lot. I probably understand why this reminds many others some cleaning product: because of the soap smell here. But I personally haven\\'t used any such in the past and I don\\'t have such associations, I only generally recognise the soap that everybody knows. \\\\nRecently I went to a department store and smelt the other scents of the same Aqua Allegoria line. There weren\\'t all of them but about 6-7. I realised that Nerolia Vetiver is very different from the rest, there\\'s nothing sweet-smelling in this one. I don\\'t really know what is a niche scent but maybe this is one, even if the producer is not considered one. It is exactly for me, a green scent that is worth being named green and having a light green colour. \\\\nAlso, this scent was a revelation to me in the sense I realised by smelling a sample of another vetiver scent (which I ordered among other samples just because this scent had vetiver mentioned in the name and is very good) that vetiver is the ingredient I like most, at least in a certain category of scents to me. I had tried one neroli scent but it wasn\\'t that impressive, maybe I have to try more to understand what that is. Now I know where to head on to find other excellent scents among so many of them: they have to contain vetiver!\", \"I love neroli, I love vetiver, and despite having access to so many raw materials, I never thought to put these together. I LOVE mandarine basil, pamplune, bergamote ... I was sure I\\'d LOVE this so I bought a whole bottle, mostly because a 30 ml option was unavailable. My first reaction was very negative -- a muddy, compost-like terroir. It started giving me a headache, which was odd snce I was pretty sure it was one of the more natural offerings in the range. I thought about returning it, then thought I\\'d try layering it with other Aqua Allegoria scents and that helped to mellow it out. On future wears, I also made sure to walk into a spritz since I really couldn\\'t handle the scent of it applied directly. I regret buying it, but think it will be a helpful stop as I learn to step away from blending things with amber, oakmoss and/or labdanum all the time\", \\'Very nice. Soapy clean with a touch of sweetness. Smells relaxing and natural. Really unisex. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a good scent for hot days. Itâ\\x80\\x99s nothing groundbreaking but itâ\\x80\\x99s well blended.\\', \\'This is my least favourite in the aqua allegoria line. It flat out smells like laundry detergent powder, it induced a headache.\\', \"NEROLI CREAM. Not what I was expecting, but this is gorgeous. I just have a tester spray, but I get the neroli & vetiver, but the fig note is actually more of a buttercream monoi oil that smells like tiare on the skin and gives it a beachy facet that altogether could read as vintage white-floral for some. In the air I get the neroli more, but softer and sweeter than usual, along with a fruity aspect from the vetiver. If you\\'re looking for that punchy, sharp citrus cleaness like Neroli Portofino Tom Ford, this isn\\'t the same thing, it\\'s something different. But if you spray Neroli Portofino Tom Ford and Jardins de Bagatelle Guerlain side by side you would be in the ballpark for the first hour-and-a-half, although this is well blended. The neroli doesn\\'t last too long in that sharply clean way but fades into a creamier ghostly pale-green version of itself, while the vetiver and buttercream keep it alive for several hours. A few hours in, I get a soft pale-green & faintly citrus scent that reads like a green-tea scent to my nose and more similar to Aqua Allegoria Bergamote Calabria Guerlain. It\\'s a love for me. Enjoy!\", \"If you like Neroli Portofino or even the original 4711 - go for it. For me it\\'s just too much neroli which I don\\'t like in perfumes. The color of the juice is soothing. Even the forte version of this is nice.\", \"I love it. But I\\'m not difficult, I love neroli and vetiver in general. And even that little bit of green fig leaf I smell is adorable. Men should love this too. But, it\\'s June and over 30*C and I oversprayed it because it\\'s what you do with Allegoria stuff...it was gone in 15 minutes. Not even the original 4711 does that.\\\\nI did wore it before, in early spring, end of winter and I got 3-4 h without problem.\\\\nI will try the Forte version, but I\\'m not a bit fan of tonka in summer, it\\'s too heavy.  \\\\nAnd I\\'m pissed at new prices, Aqua Allegorias are eau de colognes at their best, except maybe Mandarine Basilic. They decided to make even more money. Well, it works for Tom Ford, everyday freshies are so ridiculously overpriced that only fragrance snobs and crazy enthousiasts buy them over and over. \\\\nFrashies work great in heath, you spray or dab or whatever every few hours. That\\'s the point of eau de colognes! That\\'s what they were made for! And that\\'s why they are reasonably priced! Or they should be!\", \\'Couldnâ\\x80\\x99t love it more. It gets a lot of hate but then why is it always sold out ? Hmmm. I tried all the aquas and truly like each I think they are simple and elegant and very reasonable priced. I loved this though I can smell each note yes but they blend into this seamless concoction that gives expensive green frangranced sunscreen. No tropical banna boat vibes here (which hey they have their place! ). It reminds me of a soap at hotel cote de cap. Incredibly and distinctly European maybe even Mediterranean bc of the basil and fig. Definitely a summer frag. But honestly this could work nicely with fresh snow, a clean white juxtaposition. Doesnâ\\x80\\x99t last an eternity but impressive for an EDT. If the EDP has lasting power thinking of making this my half year signature.\\', \\'A weak & generic green scent...go for the Forte\\', \\'Soapy coconut with grassy herbal elements . Some white florals . Gives me a tanning lotion vibe . I would not want to smell like this\\', \\'Smells great and so well blended unlike any other harsh nerolis you find left and right. I get whiffs of bright greenery along with a gentle but prominent neroli. Fresh vetiver backbone makes this even more fun and solidifies it as a warm weather staple. Longevity is questionable, I do get anosmic to it after wearing it a little while.\\', \"If you like this but can\\'t afford it, try the og 4711. Similar and affordable.\", \\'Really stands out among all the neroli dominated perfumes on the market!  \\\\nOpens with a lovely sweet neroli!!! It stands out with the earthy vetiver and juicy mouthwatering fig joined in!!! So good I usually hate fig in EVERY perfume~ but Guerlainâ\\x80\\x99s fig accord is the one that I can really appreciate it! The dry down is where the magic starts really like the earthy vetiver it balances with the sweet neroli and stopped the neroli to be so cloying which it often makes me headache with neroli dominated perfume\\', \\'Wow, what a beautiful scent!\\', \"I tried it for the Neroli, which is beautiful but very short-lived, but fell in love with this scent for the darker dry-down. It\\'s completely unexpected and is very sexy.\", \"For about 15 minutes I thought this was going to be the exceptional neroli that didn\\'t turn to cigarette ash on me. Nope, it\\'s faint but at the 15 minute mark I started to smell the acrid scent of ashes. I\\'m so disappointed, because until that point it was a gorgeous fresh scent. I get the same ash note from Nerolia Portofino and Escale a Portofino.\", \"This is a fresh, green scent which reminds me of holidays in Italy. You could easily share a bottle with your spouse, because it\\'s not completely male or female. It\\'s nice!\", \"I recently tried Nerolia Vetiver\\\\xa0by\\\\xa0Guerlain at Sephora. It\\'s such a beautiful floral neroli scent. In the opening, the neroli note is more pronounced. I really like Guerlain\\'s neroli note for being crisp and sparkling. In a few minutes the neroli\\'s prominence is behind us and in the dry down we have a very nice fresh floral scent. I think the scent is rounded off by a mellow vetiver note and to less extent the fig note. \\\\nOverall it is a pleasant fresh floral that is unisex but slightly leans on the feminine side. I prefer this for day wear during warmer months.\", \"I\\'ve been sampling this, and I can say Nerolia Vetiver has gone into the top of my list of amongst my favourite Aqua Allegorias. Just as its name implies, on myself Nerolia Vetiver is a superb blend of neroli and vetiver. The floral aspect is beautiful and most prevailing during the first hour, with some woody background. As time progresses, the composition slowly transforms towards the impression of bitter leaves and stems done in a wonderful way. The aroma is tender but present. Even though it\\'s not mentioned in the composition, there is something soft like a delicate powdery feel, very Guerlain style. It exudes elegance and grace.  \\\\nIt reminds me of Bvlgari Eau ThÃ© Vert, but with way better performance. Nerolia Vetiver lasts at least 6 hours on me (which is great for an Aqua Allegoria), while Eau ThÃ© Vert sadly only about 10 minutes. At some stages it also reminds me of Dior Pure Poison, though I greatly prefer Nerolia Vetiver. Pure Poison ends up with an ugly synthetic drydown on myself, while Nerolia Vetiver stays beautiful throughout its transformations throughout the hours.\", \\'I have been searching for this scent for a long time! It is a reminder of younger days but without smelling juvenile. This is summer in a bottle for me! Fresh, floral but soft- not harsh or loud. Itâ\\x80\\x99s classy yet casual. I get a bit of a gardenia vibe from the combination of notes. I imagine wearing this with a sundress in the hot weather! Definitely one to add to my buy list!\\', \"It\\'s a good fresh scent, very light and clean at first, more feminine leaning and pure poisony after few minutes. \\\\nPerfect for an elegant old lady (which I plan to be, but not now) or a young bride.\", \\'This is the second Allegoria that gets my attention; first one is Nettare di Sole (which I wore on a city trip to Valecia; perfect match!). On the way back, at the airport, I came across the one.\\\\nAt first sniff, I got an instant flasback... this reminds me so much of Trussardi Skin that I used to have years ago... Never before came across a \"dupe\" until now. It\\\\\\'s not quite identical but definitely close! Smells green/yellow to me, much like the Trussardi bottle!\\\\nI definitely like it a lot, hope to buy a full size one day. I would prefer this perfume for summer though. It\\\\\\'s happy and uplifting.\\', \"Beautiful, simple and refreshing. This would be the freshie to end all freshies for me if BV Tonka Solaire wasn\\'t taking that spot already. I think it reminds me a more high quality version of Rare Pearls (maybe thats why this is reminding some people of pure poison) even though I havent smelled it in a while, I feel like I\\'ve definitely worn something similar in my teens.\", \\'I like it, very refreshing and unique. No reason not to wear it on a nice autumn/winter day too.\\', \"Beautifully simple and transparent white floral. The opening of this fragrance is a sharp and bright neroli with green basil dancing around it. As it warms up the sweetness of the fig and the dirty, earthy, slightly spicy vetiver come through and marry with the neroli and basil to make a beautifully light and refreshing yet grounded scent. Something about this takes me right to summer days. I can\\'t wait for the spring and summer to enjoy this is the sun and heat.\", \\'To me, it smels like pure poison, by dior.\\', \\'I could have written the recipe for this myself! All of my favourite ingredients at last in one fragrance! As soon as I discovered this existed, I showered, slopped on unscented deodorant, sunscreen and body lotion and schlepped off down to the shops to find it. That was a chore, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you! I braved a â\\x80\\x9crain eventâ\\x80\\x9d that is covering most of Australia and going in a circle that is â\\x80\\x9cdefinitely not a cycloneâ\\x80\\x9d to schniff this juice. It wore well for at least eight hours, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve already informed my dearest husband what Santa might like to put on top of the Christmas list as Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been a very good girl this year.\\', \"I received a complimentary mini bottle from Guerlain. I don\\'t know what to think. This is such a rare scent. It smells very green but not bright green. It smells a little bit grey. It is not a happy and uplifting scent. This is a smoky vetiver, with a very harsh neroli in the beginning, later there is this sweetness coming from the fig leaves and fig pulp, it is a little bit spicy, almost like...if the figs had a bit of cinnamon sugar.\\\\nI don\\'t know. It is interesting but not my cup of tea. Probably on a man it would be great.\", \"The scent is fresh and invigorating but somehow there\\'s a faint sweetness I can\\'t get enough of. At first it is a bit sharp, and turns sweeter over time and I can smell more and more of the figs. If you spray too much the sharpness can be overwhelming like a cleaning product as some have said, but when sprayed in moderation it almost smells ~expensive~ and ~high class~. Makes me feel like a model, like a woman in dark shades, dressed in a sleek, unisex designer suit. I don\\'t wear perfume heavily as I have a sensitive nose so this is just right for me.\", \\'Lately Iâ\\x80\\x99ve immersed myself in all things Guerlain, especially Mon Guerlain and itâ\\x80\\x99s many sweet vanilla based flankers. This is the antithesis of Mon Guerlain. \\\\nThe first spray is a rather harsh Neroli, wood and citrus. Very unisex. Very un-sweet. My first impression was it was nothing I would wear. But as it warmed on my skin, I warmed to it and changed my mind. I like to wear a scent for all occasions, and this would be perfect for outdoors and exercise. A whiff of this on a hike would be invigorating. After an hour it has become a warm wood - floral skin scent. Pleasant. Still not sure if I would spent the money for a bottle.\\', \\'I love both Neroli and Vetiver so I was very excited when this came out. Until I tested it, such a disappointment. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a very citrusy Neroli, Vetiver is only somewhere in the background and the end result is a boring low performance summer scent. Donâ\\x80\\x99t waste your money.\\', \\'Sharp bitter citrus. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not a huge citrus fan so not for me, but it may be someone elseâ\\x80\\x99s cup of tea.\\', \"Stuff is great. Bright, juicy, green, neroli and fig leaf. Fresh and clean and uplifting, grassy. It\\'s beautiful.\", \"Nice, well balanced and refined fragrance in its semplicity. The neroli is the main protagonist here. Unlike other reviews, at my nose the vetiver is quite prominent, creating the perfect base for beautiful neroli. Basically, it is all about the duo neroli and -half strp behind- vetiver. It does not evolve so much, maybe the vetiver unfolds a bit more with the time, whereas the neroli looses a bit its citrusy facet and the sharpness. I don\\'t pick up precisely basilic, but I think contribuites to an idea of greeness. Fig is the big absent to me, thus there isn\\'t any note adding sweetness to contrastate the sharpness and bitterness of the neroli. To my nose, this is an added value, I am tired of sweetness everywhere, moreover neroli and vetiver are amongst my fav notes, so it is nice to see them as protagonists! I guess, however, this is also the reson why some comments say \\'old lady\\' and \\' scrubber\\'. The scents does not project much, but linger quite at lot close to the skin, for this kind of product. It is nice? Yes, very nice. It is unique? No. To be honest there are also good neroli edt in lower cost brand. Thus, as it is sold at full price in physical shops is overpriced (sorry, I love Guerlain, but the brand\\'s name alone is not a good justification for over priced products like this), but with a good sale online could be considered.\", \"Beautiful aroma! Well this deserves much higher rating! I\\'m amazed of some of the bad descriptions below. \\\\nToilet cleaner? Artificial lemony soap? Old lady.... Jesus! Probably because you like completely different scents and don\\'t understand Neroli nor vetiver. \\\\nIf you can\\'t see the soft sophisticated beauty in this scent and call it artificial, I think you should stay far away from Neroli. The Neroli here is creamy, discreet and well blended with the other notes, I can smell the fig which give a touch of sweetness and traces of basil/vetiver. The vetiver is clean and barely noticeable and this is why many people would like this much more than other vetiver scents. I\\'\\'m actually surprised that the named it Nerolia Vetiver... I would have chosen to name it perhaps Nerolia Fig instead. Like someone else said, I also get the feeling of orange-blossom in this composition, because of the fruity creaminess it has compared to dry bitter Neroli heavy scents. And yes, in the drydown I can also see a touch of luxurious sunscrren.\\\\nBUT, the scent is kind of week and on me it became a skin scent within 30 minutes at first test, maybe I got a bit noseblind due to sticking my nose to close too fast... \\\\nI totally agree with some reviewers below: \\\\n-Unisex. Maybe slightly feminine leaning. Great for summer days. Fresh and uplifting. You get Neroli then juicy fig and clean and soapy vetiver. Maybe Basil in the background.\\\\n-Wow, this is such an elegant summer fragrance! I perceive neroli, and even some orange blossom, to be the most prominent notes.\\\\nBTW I like this soo much better than Herba fresca which to me is really feminin, and the herbs and toothpaste feeling was a bit to much really. I swaped to this and I\\'m lucky that i discovered a new summer favorite.\\\\nI will say, that I\\'m a big fan of Ferrari Bright Neroli also, that\\'s why I like this I guess. This is weeker but more sophisticated and cleaner than Bright Neroli.\\\\nSummary: You must appreciate neroli/ orangeblossom/fig to like this one :)\", \\'Great for layering as wel just like the mandarin basil one . Itâ\\x80\\x99s really similar to that one . Itâ\\x80\\x99s make every sent beter more luxe . When I layer it with la vie est belle you get a fragrance between miss Dior 2017 and scandal by night . It makes a fragrance more citrus but in a warm and comforting way , and you can smell the vetiver .\\', \"Somehow I thought it is going to be somewhere like Limone Verde with its fig and neroli notes but is completely something different and more closer to Herba Fresca with its dry fresh nonsweet aroma. \\\\nWhat I get is a blast of neroli which I\\'m crazy for, and vetiver which I\\'m learning to love with the help of this frag. \\\\nNo sweetness, no prettiness, it\\'s kind of hard core fresh dry grassy neroli vetiver. \\\\nThe dry down is gentle fresh vetiver that is a bit manly, but i think it is because I associate vetiver with manly frags. \\\\nSomewhere in the middle I can catch of something fruity and figgy that hides in the structure but, this release is focused on neroli and vetiver just as it says on the bottle. \\\\nOverall it is not trying to be likable, it is old classic vibes with modern construction, dry fresh airy soapy that sings a beautiful vetiver aura in the drydown, and it last quite some time. \\\\nNot a drop of mainstream here, just a fabulous creation for those who love it. \\\\nUpdate: after wearing it a while I learned to recognize the fig note, the dry down is vetiver with semisweet fig. Gorgeous drydown..\", \\'Smells like a grandma in the middle of a humid summer. I just donâ\\x80\\x99t understand this one maybe lol. Itâ\\x80\\x99s way too mature & soapy.\\', \\'Itâ\\x80\\x99s a big difference how this parfum smells in skin then paper. On paper is more neroli / fruity, but on my skin is fig tea to me very similar to Jo Malone black tea and cucumber. Also they say â\\x80\\x9cingredients from natural origin â\\x80\\x9c and many people are confuse and think itâ\\x80\\x99s natural, ingredients from natural origin is not the same with natural extract. I think this is just a business think for Guerlain to justify somehow the high\\\\nprince for this weak and short lasting tea parfum\\', \\'The reviewer wst below nailed it. I can just add that it is surprisingly long-lasting for an Aqua Allegoria. Projection is rather mild but fits this type of scent. Well done, Guerlain! It is just regretable that the Aqua Allegorias get quickly discontinued (I would like to have Passiflora and Teazzura back!). So if you really like one stock up, it might not be available anymore next year.\\', \"Received a sample with an online purchase. Vile, articificial lemony aroma reminiscent of cheap soap. Guerlain what ever happened - is it cost cutting or am I the only person who doesn\\'t want to smell of toilet cleaner?\", \\'I like it. Unisex. Maybe slightly feminine leaning. Great for summer days. Fresh and uplifting. You get Neroli then juicy fig and clean and soapy vetiver. Maybe Basil in the background.\\', \"The first spray gives me Nettare di Sole vibes, I can smell a sunscreen undertone that must be the fig although I wouldn\\'t be able to identify it as such if I hadn\\'t read the notes. The basil is pungent and spoils the pleasant vetiver/neroli combination. Very underwhelming to my nose and a total pass as it gave me an inmediate headache and sinus issues.\", \\'I am a devotee of classic Guerlain fragrances, and bought one of those. I received a sample of this AA along with my purchase. I have concluded that Thierry Wasser is not my cup of tea. I have sniffed his â\\x80\\x9cCherry Bombâ\\x80\\x9d, which goes under the name of â\\x80\\x9cPetite Robe Noireâ\\x80\\x9d in some jurisdictions. I can douse myself in Cherry Coke for far less expense and get a more subtle effect. \\\\nThis Nerolia Vetiver is exceptionally frustrating, because one can detect that the ingredients are high quality. But the overall effect is high end hotel shampoo. A sickly sweet showoff smell. After dry down, it is less sweet, but some kind of sweaty funk appears. The overall effect is juvenile and nasty. I need to scrub it off.\\', \\'Wow, this is such an elegant summer fragrance! I perceive neroli, and even some orange blossom, to be the most prominent notes, followed by vetiver. Fig and basil stay in the background and add to the allure. I definitely see the resemblance to 4711 Original Eau de Cologne, but Nerolia Vetiver is a bit sweeter and less citrusy sharp. When I smelled this fragrance for the first time, I was immediately transported back to the Amalfi coast and Ischia at sunset time. I think this is a must-try for lovers of cologne scents! \\\\nSo, it is a few days later and I have just visited a Guerlain counter where the sales associate sprayed Nerolia Vetiver together with Epices Exquises to demonstrate that Epices Exquises could also be suitable for a summer eveningâ\\x80¦. and I must say that this combination is really beautiful! It transforms Nerolia Vetiver into a woodier composition while bringing the fig note to the forefront.\\', \\'HUMMMMM!!!!! UN VRAI DELICE FRAIS PROPRE.

I can identify the neroli note but could not seem to smell any of the other listed notes (fig/basil/vetiver) at all. It smells like some laundry or toilet cleaning products and, frankly, a bit old fashioned. Rather sweet and warm. More suitable for the evening.\\', \"I don\\'t think this smells like Promenade des Anglais as a scent overall, but the fig accord definitely smells like it\\'s plucked from that scent. Rather than the fig taking center stage with iris, like in that scent, an herbal and semi-sweet neroli is front and center and the sweet, creamy, green fig accord hums along in the background. I smell basil, crushed leaves and greenery, a bit of citrus, and the aforementioned orange blossom. Vetiver is actually not super prominent to me. Ionones/violet add body but not powder. A really nice scent that I\\'m going to enjoy refreshing frequently throughout the summer. In terms of longevity--the main fireworks of the scent are brief...but the next morning, the place where I sprayed it still had a beautiful residue of sharp, sweet neroli and some of the green, herby fig.\", \\'Starts great, ends meh like everything of the line. The fig note is prominent in the drydown\\', \\'Wearing a sample today. It starts off quite herbal and dries down to be a bit sweeter, slightly floral/musky.

Will think about getting a bottle.\\', \\'After spraying this made me happy because it gives me a sunny beach vibe. Not like Sel Marin, but bright and clear. Later on the musc comes up joined by white florals and a slightly bitter green, very pleasant. However, after this fase it becomes more and more soapy and this lasts for hours. And although very nice, soapy is not my thing.\\', \\'On the first spray : Â«\\\\xa0WAOUH\\\\xa0Â».

It smells cooling and soothing but is not acidic or fresh like a citrus, rather more like plant sap or dew. It\\\\\\'s not particularly feminine or overtly floral, but the neroli and vetiver blend to create this soothing, serene scent which reminds me of smooth pebbles in a gently running stream. It\\\\\\'s calming, it\\\\\\'s unisex, it\\\\\\'s natural-smelling and it has surprising character for such a brief notes list. I can\\\\\\'t smell any fig at all and the basil is hiding if it is there, but I think these notes just contribute to the greener half of the scent, with the neroli filling in the space with its white, cloud-like uplift. \\\\nThis is not miles away from most other colognes/ green scents I can think of but this is actually far better than most of them (in my honest opinion). Longevity, like most AAs, is not considerable but you will get strong projection for an hour and then a soft aura for another three or four hours.

Well this deserves much higher rating! I\\'m amazed of some of the bad descriptions below. \\\\nToilet cleaner? Artificial lemony soap? Old lady.... Jesus! Probably because you like completely different scents and don\\'t understand Neroli nor vetiver. \\\\nIf you can\\'t see the soft sophisticated beauty in this scent and call it artificial, I think you should stay far away from Neroli. The Neroli here is creamy, discreet and well blended with the other notes, I can smell the fig which give a touch of sweetness and traces of basil/vetiver. The vetiver is clean and barely noticeable and this is why many people would like this much more than other vetiver scents. I\\'\\'m actually surprised that the named it Nerolia Vetiver... I would have chosen to name it perhaps Nerolia Fig instead. Like someone else said, I also get the feeling of orange-blossom in this composition, because of the fruity creaminess it has compared to dry bitter Neroli heavy scents. And yes, in the drydown I can also see a touch of luxurious sunscrren.\\\\nBUT, the scent is kind of week and on me it became a skin scent within 30 minutes at first test, maybe I got a bit noseblind due to sticking my nose to close too fast... \\\\nI totally agree with some reviewers below: \\\\n-Unisex. Maybe slightly feminine leaning. Great for summer days. Fresh and uplifting. You get Neroli then juicy fig and clean and soapy vetiver. Maybe Basil in the background.\\\\n-Wow, this is such an elegant summer fragrance! I perceive neroli, and even some orange blossom, to be the most prominent notes.\\\\nBTW I like this soo much better than Herba fresca which to me is really feminin, and the herbs and toothpaste feeling was a bit to much really. I swaped to this and I\\'m lucky that i discovered a new summer favorite.\\\\nI will say, that I\\'m a big fan of Ferrari Bright Neroli also, that\\'s why I like this I guess. This is weeker but more sophisticated and cleaner than Bright Neroli.\\\\nSummary: You must appreciate neroli/ orangeblossom/fig to like this one :)\", \"I\\'ve been sampling this, and I can say Nerolia Vetiver has gone into the top of my list of amongst my favourite Aqua Allegorias. Just as its name implies, on myself Nerolia Vetiver is a superb blend of neroli and vetiver. The floral aspect is beautiful and most prevailing during the first hour, with some woody background. As time progresses, the composition slowly transforms towards the impression of bitter leaves and stems done in a wonderful way. The aroma is tender but present. Even though it\\'s not mentioned in the composition, there is something soft like a delicate powdery feel, very Guerlain style. It exudes elegance and grace.  \\\\nIt reminds me of Bvlgari Eau ThÃ© Vert, but with way better performance. Nerolia Vetiver lasts at least 6 hours on me (which is great for an Aqua Allegoria), while Eau ThÃ© Vert sadly only about 10 minutes. At some stages it also reminds me of Dior Pure Poison, though I greatly prefer Nerolia Vetiver. Pure Poison ends up with an ugly synthetic drydown on myself, while Nerolia Vetiver stays beautiful throughout its transformations throughout the hours.\", \\'On the first spray : Â«\\\\xa0WAOUH\\\\xa0Â».

The fragrances is so wonderful and well blended. The concept is very luxurious too. They are high end frangrance and expensive but it's worth every penny invested. If you wanna quality and want to be excluvise you must invest some more money. The bottle and the box are so minimalistic and lovely. Cross of Asia is a sweet floral very femine but very elegant.

I like them both. However, the EDP is lighter and crispier and thus, more suitable for all day round wear. In addition, tuberose in the Elixir is fruity at the beginning (and personally, I don't like it), but this fruitiness gradually wears off. What remains is a beautiful, soft yet penetrating and long lasting tuberose. So long lasting that it gets annoying. In view of this, I would probably opt for the EDP.\\\", 'The risk with tuberose is to cross the \\\"plastic fake flower\\\" line; well, this surely is not the example.\\\\nThe opening is wonderful, fresh, flowery, not candy sweet, but that sweet that flowers can be when you\\\\'ve just cut them from the field.\\\\nThen the fragrance moves to a more dense side, but still remains fresh (not green!); tuberose is the predominant flower, but cleary orange blossom and fresh jasmine pair, without any sharpness, just their \\\"odor\\\"deprived of its tipical peaks.\\\\nYes, there is vanilla, but far from being something sugary or gourmand.\\\\nI tried many tuberose perfumes, I own a big amount of them, but I rarely met any so classy, delicate in its idea but strong in its performance.\\\\nLong lasting and moderate sillage, but nobody will be disturbed to smell this angelic trail.', 'I just got my sample and wow!

Unlike the EdT, which on me is pure Guerlinade from beginning to end, the cologne doesn\\\\'t have the \\\"world\\\\'s most expensive pencil shaving\\\" vibe until later on in the dry down. It holds back in a steady way. \\\\nThere are great things going on besides woody notes. There is a plush Oriental vibe, which is subtle and exotic. And a tonic-like, dry herbal finish. In the base, there is a lot of Imperial Cologne. Occasionally I get a whiff of Jicky. \\\\nLess playful than EdT, but still full of joy. It\\\\'s plush, more refined, more natural, and holds onto some of its secrets until the end. This is the version of HR that blends best with all other versions.', 'Hmmm, okay, I can smell the resemblance to the modern EdP. I prefer the EdC in smell. The EdP seemed denser, perhaps a bit too dense with the way the scent profile is. Never quite fell in love with Habit Rouge EdP, but this EdC is quite good. This may smell quite a bit like Shalimar; that leather-y/citrus opening. This is pretty old-school classy stuff. Comforting. Calm.', \\\"Gosh, I so didn't like this for the first hour, too citrus and screechy, but as it dried down, I fell in love. It became more spicy as the cinnamon, as well as rose and patchouli begin to come thru. Then the magic really starts when the Oakmoss and woody amber comes on. The next morning my wrist still smells great. My only complaint is the there really is very little silage or projection...but it is a wonderful, cosy skin scent.\\\", 'Habit Rouge  \\\\nGuerlain  \\\\nNose  \\\\nJean Paul Guerlain  \\\\nYear  \\\\n1965  \\\\nMy graduation cologne! I first wore it back in the private school for young ladies my mother sent me to back in 1969 before I went off to University. \\\\nFor me this was a gorgeous 1960\\\\'s Oriental chypre. The bottle looks like a deodorant for men and some of it is indeed quite masculine but it\\\\'s unisex by today\\\\'s standards. I don\\\\'t care for marketing fragrances as male or female. I wear whatever I like. I like the scent and that\\\\'s all that counts. To this day I enjoy wearing Habit Rouge. In French this means \\\"Red Hood\\\" or \\\"Red Cape\\\". It makes me think of a red cap and gown graduation robe. It\\\\'s elegant, polished, and dignified. It\\\\'s also very classical in formula: citrus top notes, a heart consisting of a few florals, woods, patchouli and base notes of sandalwood oak moss and amber. There is an innovative touch of dark \\\"Shalimar\\\" vanilla and leather notes as well. It\\\\'s not 100 percent like Shalimar but it has a similar air which is alright with me.  \\\\nThe citrus notes are made up of bergamot orange, lemon and tangerine. That tangerine is very prominent and the lemon-lime zest. Very aromatic and both citrusy and green. There\\\\'s a basil note in it which is detectable and other greens are coming through early on: patchouli, oak moss. The jasmine and rose scent are not as floral or as feminine as in Coty\\\\'s Emeraude, but I do get that jasmine plus an additional note of red carnation. Beautiful carnation. The basil note spices it up plus there\\\\'s cinnamon and the florals are subdued by these spices. It\\\\'s definitely more spicy than floral.  \\\\nThe mood I get wearing this fragrance is: romantic, classic, stylish, like a kind of tuxedo. It\\\\'s \\\"red\\\" theme comes from the red note of carnation and rose but neither flower is too dominant. Habit Rouge develops into a leathery, mossy, woodsy and amber dry down. It smells like a good old fashioned bar of soap for men and like a barber shop with after shave and citrus shaving foam. There\\\\'s an absence of iris and orris so it never gets powdery. The musk via the leather is amazing. I would not call this sporty or casual and it asks you to wear her at a formal evening affair, black tie affair, dinner, graduation, wedding, or gala. It\\\\'s an expensive, expensive luxurious classic cologne. I enjoy wearing this out in the evenings in the winter time. The musk and spices are absolutely gorgeous and smell best in the cold weather months.  \\\\nWhether you\\\\'re a guy or a girl this cologne is a superb Guerlain fragrance on it\\\\'s own so you have to be an experienced Guerlain fragrance collector. And if you really like Shalimar you\\\\'ll love Habit Rouge.', 'This is the only man\\\\'s cologne I wear.  \\\\nIn today\\\\'s fragrance world, however, the old vintage perfumes I wear and have worn for decades can be classified as unisex or as being \\\"men\\\\'s colognes\\\" because of the strong notes. It is a known fact that women\\\\'s fragrances of the Golden Age of Perfume (1900s 20s 30s 40s 50s 60s) were strong scents with projection and duration. There was a time when perfume was perfume. Guerlain\\\\'s Habit Rouge comes from that era.  \\\\nThis is a citrusy and aromatic floral woodsy scent of such refined elegance and sophistication as to belong in the wardrobe of Prime Ministers and Princes. The cologne is citrusy from the start. This was not unusual for a perfume to open with citrus. But here it\\\\'s quite sharp and strong with that bergamot, that orange and that lemon. But before one chokes on the citrus they settle down and turn glossy and golden like gold colored furniture polish. Then I smelled only the faintest floral notes of jasmine and rose.  \\\\nThere\\\\'s a patchouli here that really matches up with the rose so it\\\\'s on the dark black rose kind of side. It\\\\'s a patch-rose combination. It has a green aromatic herbal scent. There might also be rosemary. There\\\\'s a sandalwood and woodsy note arrangement that really gets to me. Smells wonderfully woodsy. The scent is also a bit like a good soap for a man. It\\\\'s leathery woodsy and citrusy. A classic barbershop scent. But it means business and it has a formal and sober life. It\\\\'s meant to be worn with a suit. If you\\\\'re a CEO or business man in suits try this on!  \\\\nFor women, this would wear like Shalimar. It\\\\'s a proud and loud scent of citrus, florals and patchouli/woods. This does remind em of Shalimar only far more aromatic. I wore this when I was a professor of music in the 70\\\\'s. It was always a man\\\\'s cologne so anyone who smelled it on me wondered why I would wear a cologne that smelled like their father\\\\'s cologne. I didn\\\\'t mind that they wondered and I could see that they were curious but they never asked me about my cologne.  \\\\nThe notes of vanilla and patchouli not to mention the benzoin/incense are so Shalimar so if you like Shalimar you\\\\'ll love this too. \\\\nMysterious, dark, Oriental at the dry down and citrusy and bright at the beginning. A beautiful and long lasting scent with elaborate notes and gorgeous sillage and full bodied fragrance!', 'For Vintage Eau de Cologne Habit Rouge - \\\\nOf ALL the various bottlings and concentrations of Habit Rouge, I decided that Vintage Eau de Cologne would be the most proper way to approach reviewing Habit Rouge. When acquiring or discovering the olfactory pleasure of a timeless classic, it is best to be introduced as it was initially. After all, I am a purist. I have a Vintage spray EdC (110ml) - red plastic on the top and bottom with glass and information in the middle of the flacon as it is stands (for those you who know). \\\"Copyright 1976\\\" is on the bottom of the old Guerlain flacon bought from an amazing seller, as it has been kept pristine in its original box all these years. \\\\nI have, of course, smelled it over the years (in virtually all the various formulations and concentrations) but never bought a bottle of any until somewhat recently! It was about understanding time & place - I nearly bought a bottle after my return from Paris that celebrated my 1st wedding anniversary 2000, but didn\\\\'t. More recently (a few years ago), I did though. I have always been enamored by the sophistication and beauty of this true Guerlinade - but it was a matter of feeling it was just right on me. The association to maturity felt that, \\\"I needed to be of the right age & perspective to truly feel it properly expressed the olfactory extension of self\\\". I ended up with an Original Vintage (black & white/zig-zag box) After Shave of all things first, which is an absolutely brilliant After Shave/more of an incredible \\\\'tonic & elixir\\\\' on my skin). But, onto the Vintage Eau de Cologne. So, the Vintage After Shave is on the back of my left hand right now while the Vintage EdC is on my right inner wrist. Incredible!! \\\\nThe opening of bright citrus (lemon, bergamot, orange and a hint of lime) is prominent from the EdC - and so much the \\\\'signature\\\\' of Habit Rouge, as well, there is a nice burst of crisp citrus in the After Shave that is pure invigoration. The EdC then evolves beautifully into a nice, slightly-powdery floral heart of rose, jasmine & carnation-clove (but dusted with warm, sophisticated and gentlemanly classic vanilla), blended with leather, actually smoothing out after 30 minutes (no longer powdery - but warm and inviting). The patchouli is working here, giving a nice accord of freshness and liveliness, but also a herbaceous vibe that counters the balsamic oriental notes with the wood, olibanum and leather. The balance, as stated by reviewers whom I admire is simply, harmonious. Perfection. I don\\\\'t think any one note is dominant and the composition is clearly exceptional - a landmark in fragrance that smells so fresh. Definitely something I would prefer wearing with a nice button shirt and dress attire. This is class & sophistication poured into a bottle. \\\\nThe After Shave actually has a bit more light, fresh leather than expected - along with the powdery vanilla, airy florals, some benzoin and the touch of patchouli is there as well. So, the EdC and After Shave, after going back and forth a dozen times now, compliment each other almost perfectly. The EdC is definitely stronger (this is when Eau de Cologne was rich - 85% volume is stated on box and bottle!), but the After Shave is a great skin scent with just a few dabs and actually accentuates the entire olfactory experience brilliantly. After doing research, I found that Vintage Eau de Cologne actually had more essential oils and aromachemicals in it than current formulation EdT. To smell them side-by-side, this is rather noticeable. \\\\nWhen reading more about this timeless classic, I saw a story of an individual that wore Vintage Habit Rouge - but only as a nice splashed on After Shave, of which he kept in a nice little refrigerator! It would stay for hours and he never wanted the power of the fragrance bottlings. That is a testament to how good that juice is. Personally, I like more power and refinement...so, I would want to layer in some EdC or EdT (and even blend EdP to complete a rich wearing). However, the After Shave is truly fantastic and offers a lot more than just a light scent. One of the absolute best After Shaves I have ever used on my skin...simply fantastic after a fresh, wet shave. \\\\nThe EdC has been on my skin for well over an hour and is actually so smooth and putting out more power than before. It is breathing - I am certain. This has been in a bottle for over 30 years and is ready to come to life in full form! Sure, the initial burst of citrus is bright and sharp - but this is a wonderful skin scent. I don\\\\'t think I would apply more than a couple of shots to clothing when wearing this. It wears so well on one\\\\'s skin. Spray to neck, wrists and chest - and you are engulfed in its beauty with a bit of the After Shave splashed on or perhaps decanted and sprayed lightly and blended with a nice neutral balm to create a gorgeous base layer. \\\\nThis is, simply wonderful...totally and incredibly brilliant.

Literally- think: you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re running a bath for your kids with those cheesy children\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s bubble bath. Sweet, clean smelling but really syntethic and soapy. It\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s not a bad smell, but not something that I want to smell like all the time. However, I do think it will be nice in the summer time when I don\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t want anything too sweet. Honestly would be nice for a rainy fall/spring day. I blind bought this one and was so excited for it, but its really not what I expected. I honestly mostly bought it for the base note of cotton candy (im obsessed with cotton candy). I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m going to keep trying it out and seeing if I can pick up more of the cotton candy notes and get more insight into the dry down and longevity, but as for my first impression; seriously just a kids bubble bath.

This is one of the few perfumes where I can actually smell each individual ingredient. I also found this for a steal - only $20. \\\\nI know this particular perfume can be hard to find but if you can make sure you snatch a bottle up! \\\\n4 out of 5 stars\\\", \\\"I came across this a couple weeks ago here on fragrantica and thought the notes sounded cute.. Then randomly came across it in a store today for $20! There was no tester but figured I couldn't go wrong for that price. First spray was sweet-powdery smelling, the dry down is actually a lot nicer than I thought it'd be. It's very sweet, I can definitely smell the cherry blossom and a bit of cotton candy in there, as well as a hint of something else? It almost reminds me of Katy Perrys Mad Love, even though there's no strawberry or coconut listed in this.

I really wanted this perfume but couldnt fathom the price, it was too expensive so I dutifully ordered a 5ml oil drum to test it out before biting the bullet. The good thing was that I instantly fell in love with the sweetness of the macaron and pistachio. It was playfully powdery and a bit sharp thanks to cherry blossom, not at all cloying or heavy inducing sugar comatose that I am known to wear. I found a seller willing to sell for an amazing price and now I own this in my cotton candy collection. I decided to get the 30ml from Japan because it was no longer sold under Anna Suis website at the time. I expected it to be different and it came out a florally, tamed sister. They are completely different scents, so if you find 50ml to be jejune and sweet, try the latter. I didnt care for the 30ml one at all which is sad because the cute little bow and its pink design is so adorable. \\\\nFor the 30ml edt the scent composition are: \\\\nTop Notes: Mandarin, Cranberry, Cherry blossom\\\\nHeart Notes: Peony, Magnolia, Pink pepper\\\\nBase Notes: Vanilla, White cedarwood, Musk \\\\nThe only similarity are the cherry blossom and the musk.', \\\"Wow!! What a lovely smell!!! Anna Sui Dreams is a perfume I've probably been most complimented on, out of everything I've worn, especially by men. This new one has a similar vibe to it but is not the same as Dreams. All the notes smell heavenly together. Such a feminine clean smell. I love the pistachio and the cherry blossom. It's an unusual smell, it is a little powdery but I like that. When I smelt it I got this image of white fluffy clouds and feathers or fluffy clean towels. It's just very pretty, delicate and clean smelling. I get a little of the cotton candy in the dry down but it's not over powering.\\\\nNow I'm intrigued to see if it gets as many compliments as Anna Sui Dreams. It really is lovely and very different. I can't stop sniffing my wrist!! \\\\nThis is a fairly new release so it's popularity hasn't yet been realised here in the UK. I'm sure that will change though and the price will go up. The Perfume Shop are selling 50mls Eau de parfum for \\u00c2\\u00a312.99 at the moment. Won't stay at that price for long though. Wonder why it's called L'Amour Rose when there's no rose in it? Hmmm. Still lovely though and smells amazing on clothes as well.\\\", 'Now, I have one! EDT 30ml. Very cute fruity scent at first, but it goes soft and pretty scent. I also feel powdery. Not so strong that I can use anytime anywhere. I want EDP, too.', \\\"Update: I just wanted everyone who is interested, to let you know that there is a 30ml EDT of L'Amour Rose on Anna Sui's website for $44 & $12 UPS Ground shipping if you live in the USA. The notes are some what different, there is still cherry Blossom in the EDT. I've to add that I'm surprised no one else has commented on this perfume besides me, it hurts my heart, makes me sad, because for the past year, I've been so passionate about Anna Sui perfumes. I guess no one will appreciate her perfumes like I do, which is very unfortunate. I can't wait to see the other perfumes she releases this year!\\\", \\\"I love this girl ( Anna Sui ) But there comes a time where enough is enough! FOURTH FRAGRANCE OF 2016! Just take all my money Anna Sui, until I seriously have nothing left. I just got over how bad I wanted Romantica Exotica for months, now here we go again for round 2 already!? With L'amour Rose, and here I was complaining that she didn't release enough perfumes in one years time. Maybe I will get 5 perfumes a year from her after all....\\\", \\\"Holy moly - this is THE perfect gourmand fragrance. I'm surprised that there aren't many reviews for this scent. I feel like I'm siting on top of a cotton candy cloud eating a platter of macaroons, yet the sweetness isn't overpowering, it isn't sickly sweet (think of Jessica Simpson's Fancy). This is one of the few perfumes where I can actually smell each individual ingredient. I also found this for a steal - only $20. \\\\nI know this particular perfume can be hard to find but if you can make sure you snatch a bottle up! \\\\n4 out of 5 stars\\\", \\\"I love this girl ( Anna Sui ) But there comes a time where enough is enough!

Under 30s wore Kouros, Aramis, Grey Flannel et al when those frags were new! \\\\nBut back to JPG\\\\'s rainbow flanker. \\\\nLe Male was a gamechanger when it arrived. I own a treasured vintage. And a vintage A/S Balm in the hard cylinder chisel ended, silver-cap tube....& my God it\\\\'s got EDT-worthy projection & longevity when I wear it on my arms! \\\\nSadly, JPG Le Male & this flanker are reformulated, castrated, dilutions; nowhere near the masterpiece it was. \\\\nAnd sadly....this is the only \\\\'limp-wristed\\\\' aspect of this tale.', 'I have just completed reading all the comments on this thread and once again I am appalled at the extreme level of impropriety and negativity.\\\\nFragrantica is a site dedicated to perfume lovers where we are supposed to be sharing ideas, reviewing fragrances, exchanging impressions and enlightening one another on the joys of our olfactory sense\\\\nThis is not the first time I am stating that ageism, sexism, racism and bigotry have no place here. \\\\nDoes anyone believe that perfume is not a business like any other? Of course it is, and a highly lucrative one making 33.6 billion dollars in 2020. \\\\nWe see hundreds of flankers every year and no one blinks an eye but because this one has a sticky rainbow flag on the bottle this Le Male flanker is being condemned, criticized and found distasteful?

Homosexuality isnt one of those seven. Christianity isnt about finger wagging and interpreting the bible the way you want to because you dont like something.

Chapeau monsieur JPG (and Kurkdjian of course).\\\", 'Things you may not know about Jean Paul Gaultier or why this limited edition bottle is of significance;\\\\n1. He\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s gay\\\\n2. Does a lot of philanthropy for the LGBTQ+ community\\\\n3. This past year has been the 50th anniversary of the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cStonewall Riots\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\\\n4. His partner, Francis Menuge, died of AIDS 30 years ago this year.\\\\n5. He celebrated 50 years in the fashion industry this year\\\\n6. He exited the fashion industry this year\\\\n7. Homophobia and the fight for equality/acceptance isn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t over for the gay community, and as mentioned, there is still stigma by ignorant people that somehow this will make you gay in some way. Majority of people who buy this are club kids and dads/wives for their husbands. \\\\n8. JPG is the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cEnfant Terrible\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d for being an expressionist and accepting nonconformative beauty, which is a lot to do with why Le Male was popular in the gay community, including lesbians (Classique wasn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t associated with the gay community). It\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s appropriate for such a significant fragrance that was very much intertwined to the gay community to be sporting a rainbow flag.\\\\n9. Fragrance is a form of expression and LM is still a top 10 fragrance in most countries, which gives the statement a large visual platform to spread recognition. Even if the Ltd Ed bottle doesn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t sell, it makes a statement about the brand and face. When conservative societies see this scent as a cult classic, such as those in the UAE, and acknowledge most designers are gay, but still choose to wear their fashions due to style and popularity, I don\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t think they\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll make a big fuss over knowing that JPG launched a bottle with a pride flag. \\\\n************* \\\\nIndividuals who are skeptical to wear Le Male due to insecurities about sexuality, aren\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t skeptical of Le Male alone, but fragrance in general. Over the years of being in the industry, those individuals are afraid of wearing anything that they find may be too feminine. These individuals are more prone to wearing Axe deodorant as their fragrance of choice and avoid traditional/designer fragrance in general. \\\\nMovements such as gay rights, women\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s equality and black rights are still prevalent wotj different severity in different regions, because they\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re still a major issue. Movements will gain and lose traction, but as long as the inequality exists, things such as this Ltd Ed are still relevant. It may not have meaning to you, but it may have meaning and significance elsewhere, where visual representation is necessary and can make even the most minute difference in one person\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s life.', \\\"The discussion here just goes to show for me once again, that fragrantica would do a lot better, if they didn't open a whole new page for all those collector bottles and just added a little thumbnail of it to the main page of the fragrance. \\\\nThe comments under such redundant pages are invariably useless. Either it's people confused about if this is the same fragrance or not (it is). Or in this case it's an off topic discussion about the campaign and the politics of it, with some bigotted characters coming out of the wood work too. \\\\nI didn't even know this used to be a gay community favorite. Thank you, invaderlark, for this actually interesting piece of trivia. \\\\nAnyway, the main problem with such 'message'/'virtue signalling' campaigns is that they are for the most part two things: pandering and utterly inconsequential. Sorry, but as long as you don't pledge at least a part of the generated revenue to an ngo of a related cause, advertising, selling or buying a gay pride product is nothing but that; virtue signaling pandering to other people eager to virtue signal and it does nothing to change the situation for people who are still suffering under bigotry all over the world. \\\\nNone of the comments here, including mine, are really reviews.
