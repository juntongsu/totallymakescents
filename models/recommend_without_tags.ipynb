It also has a green, herbaceous tone in it, which is probably courtesy of the basil. The fig note is also there underneath giving it a bit of creaminess, which made me realize that neroli and fig could make a really interesting and pleasant combination. I unfortunately haven\\'t smelled vetiver in isolation, hence I can\\'t comment on its contribution. \\\\nOverall, this is a really pleasant, likable and easy to wear scent that one can wear on a daily basis. It\\'s my approachable clean girl fragrance, lol...i really like it though.\", \\'It has a screechy opening that actually induces headaches. The dry down though is sweet - it could be the fig.\\', \\'I agree with the comment below.\\\\nThis one is really challenging. Way too sharp and green while the white floral aspect is subdued.\\\\nAlso this is nothing like Neroli Amara by VCA. Surely, they both have as a main note the neroli, but I find Nerolia Vetiver more complex and challenging because of the green and sharp quality it has.\\\\nNeroli Amara is fresh and citrusy, easy-going and more rounded scent. \\\\nFor me Nerolia Vetiver is not a safe blind buy.\\', \\'Oooh this is a tough one. I recognize it is beautiful because I can discern natural notes of neroli, vetiver and basil. But as a fragrance, it is not for me. I find it really sharp and masculine-leaning in the opening. It reminds me a lot of 4711 Eau De Cologne, but stronger. The drydown is more mellow, but soapy.\\', \"Vetiver and neroli are beautiful scents. If the usual vetiver scents are too prickly for you, you should try this Guerlain. Gentle, slightly soapy, unisex and a little creamy. It actually reminds me a little of Creed\\'s Vetiver. This perfume is a little insider tip.\", \\'I prefer this to the Forte or Harvest version, as those contain orange blossom, which Iâ\\x80\\x99m not a fan of, and make the neroli seem sweeter and less fresh. This has phenomenal performance, good longevity and projection for an EDT so I bought a 125 ml on sale. The fig in this smells like fig nectar.\\', \"I love this fresh green floral that is not sweet or cloying. I really enjoy the sharpness of the top neroli note, and find that it lasts a surprisingly long time for a this type of scent, or any Aqua Allegoria I\\'ve tried. Every time I wear it I ask myself why I don\\'t wear it more often!\", \\'I have this and each time I wear it I question if I like it, but then get addicted to sniffing it throughout the day. It smells clean, strongly of citrus, though it is a bit â\\x80\\x9cdryâ\\x80\\x9d of a smell (possibly the vetiver), with some inoffensive (quite pretty actually) florals and slight sweetness rounding things off. There is something bitter (if you could smell bitter!) in the opening. Maybe thatâ\\x80\\x99s why I always question whether I like it or not. Anyway, this isnâ\\x80\\x99t a perfume I choose to wear often, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad to have it, because it is very enjoyable in the summer. It smells very realistic, not fake or cloying. I also own 2 other Aqua Allegoria and I get the best performance and silage out of this one, about 5 hours on skin, 8 on clothing. I consider that very good for such a light, fresh, citrusy eau de toilette. Perfectly enjoyable, perfectly unisex.\\', \"There are some very strange \\'noses\\' and interpretations on this below.\\\\nI know we all have different noses, brains and body chemistry but come on, some of you are surely not smelling the same fragrance.\\\\nIt\\'s these wildly different and bizarre reviews that make this review section all pretty pointless. \\\\nCleaning product? Pledge? Same vetiver as Guerlain Vetiver? FFS.\", \\'The only one in the entire Aqua Allegoria range that actually has a hint of sweetness to it! What a lovely fragrance - ethereal, simply divine.\\', \\'To me the opening vetiver note smells alot like the vetiver in guerlian vetiver which I expected but overall smells alot like an aqua di Parma scent I donâ\\x80\\x99t hate it but itâ\\x80\\x99s a bit boring and generic and becomes redundant nothing too special about it\\', \\'I need this for summer. It is fresh, but not the usual boring citrus. It is soapy and clean. I could not imagine someone not liking it. My next purchase for sure.\\', \"I got a sample of this from a travelling sample box (EU) which is a very cool idea and is administered here in Fragrantica in one of the forum threads (under Perfume Splits and Member Giveaways). This was my nr. 1 finding among nearly 200 samples. I had searched for a green scent and didn\\'t even know what to look for. I had experiences with something extremely green before, like Demeter\\'s To Yo Ran Orchid and Dandelion which basically smell like cut flowers and cut grass (harsh green!), besides they were oil-based, leaving marks on clothes. Having smelt the sample of this was like a revelation: this is the one I want! I bought a full bottle immediately and wasn\\'t disappointed at all! Even though it has the same soapy ingredient -- whatever it is, like in Pierre Balmain\\'s Vent Vert, that I don\\'t enjoy that much -- I still like it a lot. I probably understand why this reminds many others some cleaning product: because of the soap smell here. But I personally haven\\'t used any such in the past and I don\\'t have such associations, I only generally recognise the soap that everybody knows. \\\\nRecently I went to a department store and smelt the other scents of the same Aqua Allegoria line. There weren\\'t all of them but about 6-7. I realised that Nerolia Vetiver is very different from the rest, there\\'s nothing sweet-smelling in this one. I don\\'t really know what is a niche scent but maybe this is one, even if the producer is not considered one. It is exactly for me, a green scent that is worth being named green and having a light green colour. \\\\nAlso, this scent was a revelation to me in the sense I realised by smelling a sample of another vetiver scent (which I ordered among other samples just because this scent had vetiver mentioned in the name and is very good) that vetiver is the ingredient I like most, at least in a certain category of scents to me. I had tried one neroli scent but it wasn\\'t that impressive, maybe I have to try more to understand what that is. Now I know where to head on to find other excellent scents among so many of them: they have to contain vetiver!\", \"I love neroli, I love vetiver, and despite having access to so many raw materials, I never thought to put these together. I LOVE mandarine basil, pamplune, bergamote ... I was sure I\\'d LOVE this so I bought a whole bottle, mostly because a 30 ml option was unavailable. My first reaction was very negative -- a muddy, compost-like terroir. It started giving me a headache, which was odd snce I was pretty sure it was one of the more natural offerings in the range. I thought about returning it, then thought I\\'d try layering it with other Aqua Allegoria scents and that helped to mellow it out. On future wears, I also made sure to walk into a spritz since I really couldn\\'t handle the scent of it applied directly. I regret buying it, but think it will be a helpful stop as I learn to step away from blending things with amber, oakmoss and/or labdanum all the time\", \\'Very nice. Soapy clean with a touch of sweetness. Smells relaxing and natural. Really unisex. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a good scent for hot days. Itâ\\x80\\x99s nothing groundbreaking but itâ\\x80\\x99s well blended.\\', \\'This is my least favourite in the aqua allegoria line. It flat out smells like laundry detergent powder, it induced a headache.\\', \"NEROLI CREAM. Not what I was expecting, but this is gorgeous. I just have a tester spray, but I get the neroli & vetiver, but the fig note is actually more of a buttercream monoi oil that smells like tiare on the skin and gives it a beachy facet that altogether could read as vintage white-floral for some. In the air I get the neroli more, but softer and sweeter than usual, along with a fruity aspect from the vetiver. If you\\'re looking for that punchy, sharp citrus cleaness like Neroli Portofino Tom Ford, this isn\\'t the same thing, it\\'s something different. But if you spray Neroli Portofino Tom Ford and Jardins de Bagatelle Guerlain side by side you would be in the ballpark for the first hour-and-a-half, although this is well blended. The neroli doesn\\'t last too long in that sharply clean way but fades into a creamier ghostly pale-green version of itself, while the vetiver and buttercream keep it alive for several hours. A few hours in, I get a soft pale-green & faintly citrus scent that reads like a green-tea scent to my nose and more similar to Aqua Allegoria Bergamote Calabria Guerlain. It\\'s a love for me. Enjoy!\", \"If you like Neroli Portofino or even the original 4711 - go for it. For me it\\'s just too much neroli which I don\\'t like in perfumes. The color of the juice is soothing. Even the forte version of this is nice.\", \"I love it. But I\\'m not difficult, I love neroli and vetiver in general. And even that little bit of green fig leaf I smell is adorable. Men should love this too. But, it\\'s June and over 30*C and I oversprayed it because it\\'s what you do with Allegoria stuff...it was gone in 15 minutes. Not even the original 4711 does that.\\\\nI did wore it before, in early spring, end of winter and I got 3-4 h without problem.\\\\nI will try the Forte version, but I\\'m not a bit fan of tonka in summer, it\\'s too heavy.  \\\\nAnd I\\'m pissed at new prices, Aqua Allegorias are eau de colognes at their best, except maybe Mandarine Basilic. They decided to make even more money. Well, it works for Tom Ford, everyday freshies are so ridiculously overpriced that only fragrance snobs and crazy enthousiasts buy them over and over. \\\\nFrashies work great in heath, you spray or dab or whatever every few hours. That\\'s the point of eau de colognes! That\\'s what they were made for! And that\\'s why they are reasonably priced! Or they should be!\", \\'Couldnâ\\x80\\x99t love it more. It gets a lot of hate but then why is it always sold out ? Hmmm. I tried all the aquas and truly like each I think they are simple and elegant and very reasonable priced. I loved this though I can smell each note yes but they blend into this seamless concoction that gives expensive green frangranced sunscreen. No tropical banna boat vibes here (which hey they have their place! ). It reminds me of a soap at hotel cote de cap. Incredibly and distinctly European maybe even Mediterranean bc of the basil and fig. Definitely a summer frag. But honestly this could work nicely with fresh snow, a clean white juxtaposition. Doesnâ\\x80\\x99t last an eternity but impressive for an EDT. If the EDP has lasting power thinking of making this my half year signature.\\', \\'A weak & generic green scent...go for the Forte\\', \\'Soapy coconut with grassy herbal elements . Some white florals . Gives me a tanning lotion vibe . I would not want to smell like this\\', \\'Smells great and so well blended unlike any other harsh nerolis you find left and right. I get whiffs of bright greenery along with a gentle but prominent neroli. Fresh vetiver backbone makes this even more fun and solidifies it as a warm weather staple. Longevity is questionable, I do get anosmic to it after wearing it a little while.\\', \"If you like this but can\\'t afford it, try the og 4711. Similar and affordable.\", \\'Really stands out among all the neroli dominated perfumes on the market!  \\\\nOpens with a lovely sweet neroli!!! It stands out with the earthy vetiver and juicy mouthwatering fig joined in!!! So good I usually hate fig in EVERY perfume~ but Guerlainâ\\x80\\x99s fig accord is the one that I can really appreciate it! The dry down is where the magic starts really like the earthy vetiver it balances with the sweet neroli and stopped the neroli to be so cloying which it often makes me headache with neroli dominated perfume\\', \\'Wow, what a beautiful scent!\\', \"I tried it for the Neroli, which is beautiful but very short-lived, but fell in love with this scent for the darker dry-down. It\\'s completely unexpected and is very sexy.\", \"For about 15 minutes I thought this was going to be the exceptional neroli that didn\\'t turn to cigarette ash on me. Nope, it\\'s faint but at the 15 minute mark I started to smell the acrid scent of ashes. I\\'m so disappointed, because until that point it was a gorgeous fresh scent. I get the same ash note from Nerolia Portofino and Escale a Portofino.\", \"This is a fresh, green scent which reminds me of holidays in Italy. You could easily share a bottle with your spouse, because it\\'s not completely male or female. It\\'s nice!\", \"I recently tried Nerolia Vetiver\\\\xa0by\\\\xa0Guerlain at Sephora. It\\'s such a beautiful floral neroli scent. In the opening, the neroli note is more pronounced. I really like Guerlain\\'s neroli note for being crisp and sparkling. In a few minutes the neroli\\'s prominence is behind us and in the dry down we have a very nice fresh floral scent. I think the scent is rounded off by a mellow vetiver note and to less extent the fig note. \\\\nOverall it is a pleasant fresh floral that is unisex but slightly leans on the feminine side. I prefer this for day wear during warmer months.\", \"I\\'ve been sampling this, and I can say Nerolia Vetiver has gone into the top of my list of amongst my favourite Aqua Allegorias. Just as its name implies, on myself Nerolia Vetiver is a superb blend of neroli and vetiver. The floral aspect is beautiful and most prevailing during the first hour, with some woody background. As time progresses, the composition slowly transforms towards the impression of bitter leaves and stems done in a wonderful way. The aroma is tender but present. Even though it\\'s not mentioned in the composition, there is something soft like a delicate powdery feel, very Guerlain style. It exudes elegance and grace.  \\\\nIt reminds me of Bvlgari Eau ThÃ© Vert, but with way better performance. Nerolia Vetiver lasts at least 6 hours on me (which is great for an Aqua Allegoria), while Eau ThÃ© Vert sadly only about 10 minutes. At some stages it also reminds me of Dior Pure Poison, though I greatly prefer Nerolia Vetiver. Pure Poison ends up with an ugly synthetic drydown on myself, while Nerolia Vetiver stays beautiful throughout its transformations throughout the hours.\", \\'I have been searching for this scent for a long time! It is a reminder of younger days but without smelling juvenile. This is summer in a bottle for me! Fresh, floral but soft- not harsh or loud. Itâ\\x80\\x99s classy yet casual. I get a bit of a gardenia vibe from the combination of notes. I imagine wearing this with a sundress in the hot weather! Definitely one to add to my buy list!\\', \"It\\'s a good fresh scent, very light and clean at first, more feminine leaning and pure poisony after few minutes. \\\\nPerfect for an elegant old lady (which I plan to be, but not now) or a young bride.\", \\'This is the second Allegoria that gets my attention; first one is Nettare di Sole (which I wore on a city trip to Valecia; perfect match!). On the way back, at the airport, I came across the one.\\\\nAt first sniff, I got an instant flasback... this reminds me so much of Trussardi Skin that I used to have years ago... Never before came across a \"dupe\" until now. It\\\\\\'s not quite identical but definitely close! Smells green/yellow to me, much like the Trussardi bottle!\\\\nI definitely like it a lot, hope to buy a full size one day. I would prefer this perfume for summer though. It\\\\\\'s happy and uplifting.\\', \"Beautiful, simple and refreshing. This would be the freshie to end all freshies for me if BV Tonka Solaire wasn\\'t taking that spot already. I think it reminds me a more high quality version of Rare Pearls (maybe thats why this is reminding some people of pure poison) even though I havent smelled it in a while, I feel like I\\'ve definitely worn something similar in my teens.\", \\'I like it, very refreshing and unique. No reason not to wear it on a nice autumn/winter day too.\\', \"Beautifully simple and transparent white floral. The opening of this fragrance is a sharp and bright neroli with green basil dancing around it. As it warms up the sweetness of the fig and the dirty, earthy, slightly spicy vetiver come through and marry with the neroli and basil to make a beautifully light and refreshing yet grounded scent. Something about this takes me right to summer days. I can\\'t wait for the spring and summer to enjoy this is the sun and heat.\", \\'To me, it smels like pure poison, by dior.\\', \\'I could have written the recipe for this myself! All of my favourite ingredients at last in one fragrance! As soon as I discovered this existed, I showered, slopped on unscented deodorant, sunscreen and body lotion and schlepped off down to the shops to find it. That was a chore, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you! I braved a â\\x80\\x9crain eventâ\\x80\\x9d that is covering most of Australia and going in a circle that is â\\x80\\x9cdefinitely not a cycloneâ\\x80\\x9d to schniff this juice. It wore well for at least eight hours, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve already informed my dearest husband what Santa might like to put on top of the Christmas list as Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been a very good girl this year.\\', \"I received a complimentary mini bottle from Guerlain. I don\\'t know what to think. This is such a rare scent. It smells very green but not bright green. It smells a little bit grey. It is not a happy and uplifting scent. This is a smoky vetiver, with a very harsh neroli in the beginning, later there is this sweetness coming from the fig leaves and fig pulp, it is a little bit spicy, almost like...if the figs had a bit of cinnamon sugar.\\\\nI don\\'t know. It is interesting but not my cup of tea. Probably on a man it would be great.\", \"The scent is fresh and invigorating but somehow there\\'s a faint sweetness I can\\'t get enough of. At first it is a bit sharp, and turns sweeter over time and I can smell more and more of the figs. If you spray too much the sharpness can be overwhelming like a cleaning product as some have said, but when sprayed in moderation it almost smells ~expensive~ and ~high class~. Makes me feel like a model, like a woman in dark shades, dressed in a sleek, unisex designer suit. I don\\'t wear perfume heavily as I have a sensitive nose so this is just right for me.\", \\'Lately Iâ\\x80\\x99ve immersed myself in all things Guerlain, especially Mon Guerlain and itâ\\x80\\x99s many sweet vanilla based flankers. This is the antithesis of Mon Guerlain. \\\\nThe first spray is a rather harsh Neroli, wood and citrus. Very unisex. Very un-sweet. My first impression was it was nothing I would wear. But as it warmed on my skin, I warmed to it and changed my mind. I like to wear a scent for all occasions, and this would be perfect for outdoors and exercise. A whiff of this on a hike would be invigorating. After an hour it has become a warm wood - floral skin scent. Pleasant. Still not sure if I would spent the money for a bottle.\\', \\'I love both Neroli and Vetiver so I was very excited when this came out. Until I tested it, such a disappointment. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a very citrusy Neroli, Vetiver is only somewhere in the background and the end result is a boring low performance summer scent. Donâ\\x80\\x99t waste your money.\\', \\'Sharp bitter citrus. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not a huge citrus fan so not for me, but it may be someone elseâ\\x80\\x99s cup of tea.\\', \"Stuff is great. Bright, juicy, green, neroli and fig leaf. Fresh and clean and uplifting, grassy. It\\'s beautiful.\", \"Nice, well balanced and refined fragrance in its semplicity. The neroli is the main protagonist here. Unlike other reviews, at my nose the vetiver is quite prominent, creating the perfect base for beautiful neroli. Basically, it is all about the duo neroli and -half strp behind- vetiver. It does not evolve so much, maybe the vetiver unfolds a bit more with the time, whereas the neroli looses a bit its citrusy facet and the sharpness. I don\\'t pick up precisely basilic, but I think contribuites to an idea of greeness. Fig is the big absent to me, thus there isn\\'t any note adding sweetness to contrastate the sharpness and bitterness of the neroli. To my nose, this is an added value, I am tired of sweetness everywhere, moreover neroli and vetiver are amongst my fav notes, so it is nice to see them as protagonists! I guess, however, this is also the reson why some comments say \\'old lady\\' and \\' scrubber\\'. The scents does not project much, but linger quite at lot close to the skin, for this kind of product. It is nice? Yes, very nice. It is unique? No. To be honest there are also good neroli edt in lower cost brand. Thus, as it is sold at full price in physical shops is overpriced (sorry, I love Guerlain, but the brand\\'s name alone is not a good justification for over priced products like this), but with a good sale online could be considered.\", \"Beautiful aroma! Well this deserves much higher rating! I\\'m amazed of some of the bad descriptions below. \\\\nToilet cleaner? Artificial lemony soap? Old lady.... Jesus! Probably because you like completely different scents and don\\'t understand Neroli nor vetiver. \\\\nIf you can\\'t see the soft sophisticated beauty in this scent and call it artificial, I think you should stay far away from Neroli. The Neroli here is creamy, discreet and well blended with the other notes, I can smell the fig which give a touch of sweetness and traces of basil/vetiver. The vetiver is clean and barely noticeable and this is why many people would like this much more than other vetiver scents. I\\'\\'m actually surprised that the named it Nerolia Vetiver... I would have chosen to name it perhaps Nerolia Fig instead. Like someone else said, I also get the feeling of orange-blossom in this composition, because of the fruity creaminess it has compared to dry bitter Neroli heavy scents. And yes, in the drydown I can also see a touch of luxurious sunscrren.\\\\nBUT, the scent is kind of week and on me it became a skin scent within 30 minutes at first test, maybe I got a bit noseblind due to sticking my nose to close too fast... \\\\nI totally agree with some reviewers below: \\\\n-Unisex. Maybe slightly feminine leaning. Great for summer days. Fresh and uplifting. You get Neroli then juicy fig and clean and soapy vetiver. Maybe Basil in the background.\\\\n-Wow, this is such an elegant summer fragrance! I perceive neroli, and even some orange blossom, to be the most prominent notes.\\\\nBTW I like this soo much better than Herba fresca which to me is really feminin, and the herbs and toothpaste feeling was a bit to much really. I swaped to this and I\\'m lucky that i discovered a new summer favorite.\\\\nI will say, that I\\'m a big fan of Ferrari Bright Neroli also, that\\'s why I like this I guess. This is weeker but more sophisticated and cleaner than Bright Neroli.\\\\nSummary: You must appreciate neroli/ orangeblossom/fig to like this one :)\", \\'Great for layering as wel just like the mandarin basil one . Itâ\\x80\\x99s really similar to that one . Itâ\\x80\\x99s make every sent beter more luxe . When I layer it with la vie est belle you get a fragrance between miss Dior 2017 and scandal by night . It makes a fragrance more citrus but in a warm and comforting way , and you can smell the vetiver .\\', \"Somehow I thought it is going to be somewhere like Limone Verde with its fig and neroli notes but is completely something different and more closer to Herba Fresca with its dry fresh nonsweet aroma. \\\\nWhat I get is a blast of neroli which I\\'m crazy for, and vetiver which I\\'m learning to love with the help of this frag. \\\\nNo sweetness, no prettiness, it\\'s kind of hard core fresh dry grassy neroli vetiver. \\\\nThe dry down is gentle fresh vetiver that is a bit manly, but i think it is because I associate vetiver with manly frags. \\\\nSomewhere in the middle I can catch of something fruity and figgy that hides in the structure but, this release is focused on neroli and vetiver just as it says on the bottle. \\\\nOverall it is not trying to be likable, it is old classic vibes with modern construction, dry fresh airy soapy that sings a beautiful vetiver aura in the drydown, and it last quite some time. \\\\nNot a drop of mainstream here, just a fabulous creation for those who love it. \\\\nUpdate: after wearing it a while I learned to recognize the fig note, the dry down is vetiver with semisweet fig. Gorgeous drydown..\", \\'Smells like a grandma in the middle of a humid summer. I just donâ\\x80\\x99t understand this one maybe lol. Itâ\\x80\\x99s way too mature & soapy.\\', \\'Itâ\\x80\\x99s a big difference how this parfum smells in skin then paper. On paper is more neroli / fruity, but on my skin is fig tea to me very similar to Jo Malone black tea and cucumber. Also they say â\\x80\\x9cingredients from natural origin â\\x80\\x9c and many people are confuse and think itâ\\x80\\x99s natural, ingredients from natural origin is not the same with natural extract. I think this is just a business think for Guerlain to justify somehow the high\\\\nprince for this weak and short lasting tea parfum\\', \\'The reviewer wst below nailed it. I can just add that it is surprisingly long-lasting for an Aqua Allegoria. Projection is rather mild but fits this type of scent. Well done, Guerlain! It is just regretable that the Aqua Allegorias get quickly discontinued (I would like to have Passiflora and Teazzura back!). So if you really like one stock up, it might not be available anymore next year.\\', \"Received a sample with an online purchase. Vile, articificial lemony aroma reminiscent of cheap soap. Guerlain what ever happened - is it cost cutting or am I the only person who doesn\\'t want to smell of toilet cleaner?\", \\'I like it. Unisex. Maybe slightly feminine leaning. Great for summer days. Fresh and uplifting. You get Neroli then juicy fig and clean and soapy vetiver. Maybe Basil in the background.\\', \"The first spray gives me Nettare di Sole vibes, I can smell a sunscreen undertone that must be the fig although I wouldn\\'t be able to identify it as such if I hadn\\'t read the notes. The basil is pungent and spoils the pleasant vetiver/neroli combination. Very underwhelming to my nose and a total pass as it gave me an inmediate headache and sinus issues.\", \\'I am a devotee of classic Guerlain fragrances, and bought one of those. I received a sample of this AA along with my purchase. I have concluded that Thierry Wasser is not my cup of tea. I have sniffed his â\\x80\\x9cCherry Bombâ\\x80\\x9d, which goes under the name of â\\x80\\x9cPetite Robe Noireâ\\x80\\x9d in some jurisdictions. I can douse myself in Cherry Coke for far less expense and get a more subtle effect. \\\\nThis Nerolia Vetiver is exceptionally frustrating, because one can detect that the ingredients are high quality. But the overall effect is high end hotel shampoo. A sickly sweet showoff smell. After dry down, it is less sweet, but some kind of sweaty funk appears. The overall effect is juvenile and nasty. I need to scrub it off.\\', \\'Wow, this is such an elegant summer fragrance! I perceive neroli, and even some orange blossom, to be the most prominent notes, followed by vetiver. Fig and basil stay in the background and add to the allure. I definitely see the resemblance to 4711 Original Eau de Cologne, but Nerolia Vetiver is a bit sweeter and less citrusy sharp. When I smelled this fragrance for the first time, I was immediately transported back to the Amalfi coast and Ischia at sunset time. I think this is a must-try for lovers of cologne scents! \\\\nSo, it is a few days later and I have just visited a Guerlain counter where the sales associate sprayed Nerolia Vetiver together with Epices Exquises to demonstrate that Epices Exquises could also be suitable for a summer eveningâ\\x80¦. and I must say that this combination is really beautiful! It transforms Nerolia Vetiver into a woodier composition while bringing the fig note to the forefront.\\', \\'HUMMMMM!!!!! UN VRAI DELICE FRAIS PROPRE. ON SENT BIEN LE NEROLI ET EN MEME TEMPS LE VETIVERT.JENE SENT PAS DE FIGUE. J AI TESTE L ECHANTILLON VAIS COMMANDER LES 75ML CAR RAFRAICHIT PENDANT LES FORTES CHALEURS. A ACHETER SANS SOUCIS EN BUY BLIND\\', \\'This is one of the better from Aqua Allegoria. I can identify the neroli note but could not seem to smell any of the other listed notes (fig/basil/vetiver) at all. It smells like some laundry or toilet cleaning products and, frankly, a bit old fashioned. Rather sweet and warm. More suitable for the evening.\\', \"I don\\'t think this smells like Promenade des Anglais as a scent overall, but the fig accord definitely smells like it\\'s plucked from that scent. Rather than the fig taking center stage with iris, like in that scent, an herbal and semi-sweet neroli is front and center and the sweet, creamy, green fig accord hums along in the background. I smell basil, crushed leaves and greenery, a bit of citrus, and the aforementioned orange blossom. Vetiver is actually not super prominent to me. Ionones/violet add body but not powder. A really nice scent that I\\'m going to enjoy refreshing frequently throughout the summer. In terms of longevity--the main fireworks of the scent are brief...but the next morning, the place where I sprayed it still had a beautiful residue of sharp, sweet neroli and some of the green, herby fig.\", \\'Starts great, ends meh like everything of the line. The fig note is prominent in the drydown\\', \\'Wearing a sample today. It starts off quite herbal and dries down to be a bit sweeter, slightly floral/musky. I could smell it on myself for the first few hours but by 5/6 hours itâ\\x80\\x99s a skin scent. I enjoyed this one, smells clean, great for a Spring day, not overpowering. Will think about getting a bottle.\\', \\'After spraying this made me happy because it gives me a sunny beach vibe. Not like Sel Marin, but bright and clear. Later on the musc comes up joined by white florals and a slightly bitter green, very pleasant. However, after this fase it becomes more and more soapy and this lasts for hours. And although very nice, soapy is not my thing.\\', \\'On the first spray : Â«\\\\xa0WAOUH\\\\xa0Â». I need the biggest bottle i can found, i think this will be my next summer signature scent.\\\\nIn the opening, it smells like a bar soap in the best way possible and the dry down is a unisex type fresh floral i would say.

It smells cooling and soothing but is not acidic or fresh like a citrus, rather more like plant sap or dew. It\\\\\\'s not particularly feminine or overtly floral, but the neroli and vetiver blend to create this soothing, serene scent which reminds me of smooth pebbles in a gently running stream. It\\\\\\'s calming, it\\\\\\'s unisex, it\\\\\\'s natural-smelling and it has surprising character for such a brief notes list. I can\\\\\\'t smell any fig at all and the basil is hiding if it is there, but I think these notes just contribute to the greener half of the scent, with the neroli filling in the space with its white, cloud-like uplift. \\\\nThis is not miles away from most other colognes/ green scents I can think of but this is actually far better than most of them (in my honest opinion). Longevity, like most AAs, is not considerable but you will get strong projection for an hour and then a soft aura for another three or four hours. If you\\\\\\'re someone who likes Aqua Allegorias in general you will enjoy this, and I\\\\\\'m glad to see Guerlain slow down a little and make something really very lovely.\\', \\'So sad!

Fresh, green, watery white florals make up Divine, with a squeeze of natural fruit juice. Freesia is the most prominent note to my nose, and water hyacinth (a note I haven\\'t smelled before, but judging from its description) is a close second. It is aquatic, slightly aromatic and green. Bamboo adds a very light, green woodiness, complementing the other notes nicely. The drydown is musky as the aquatic florals fade. I do get a hint of plum in the base too. Longevity is short-lived and sillage is intimate-to-moderate while it lasts. \\\\nLinear, fresh and extremely subtle, this scent has no sharp edges (unlike, for example, D&G Light Blue).

Cheap blind buy but not worth my money, in my opinion.', \\\"A new fave, blind acquired based on reviews here. This fragrance makes me never want to pay more than $20 for a scent ever again! Quality and performance of this 'cheapie' suit me better than all of the spendy niche ouds I have been considering (Montale, Roja, Nasomatto, Guerlain). A true oud, complete with acrid medicinal bite in the opening, Monotheme Black Oud mellows out to a politely wearable cool woody floral experience, light and clean where other perfumes bearing similar name and notes tend to be overbearingly dark and tarry. This is the only oud perfume I have tried (other than TF Oud Minerale, which hardly qulifies) that I would consider bringing out in warm Spring and Autumn weather. In the absence of any funky horse barn cast or overtly synthetic spoilers, the bitter oud note blends pleasantly with sandalwood, smoke, spices, and rose, lending the composition the faintest tinge of edgy danger, without the risk of rolling over into a body odor situation. On its own, this fragrance is elegant, subtle and yet distinctive for mature wearers of all genders. As an under layer, it successfully adds depth and niche-like performance quality to lighter fruit, citrus, aromatic, fougere, and floral perfumes. For mixology purposes, this will supercede my Demeter Oud, which smells more like black truffle in comparison. Definitely recommended for those who love both a good oud perfume and a great value.\\\", \\\"I found that one on price of 9 euros so I said.. Oud with 9 euros how good can it be? So it's reaaally good! I had compliments from the first time I wear it and everybody thought that it was expensive oudy fragrance! Sweet ambery oud great for cold nights and only 9 euros! Also good longevity and sillage! If you find it just buy it! It worths a lot more!\\\", \\\"REVIEW | 100 ml purchased from M&S \\\\nExcellente!!! ...as they say at the Ambassadors party. ;) \\\\nI blind bought this from M&S for only \\u00c2\\u00a317.00. On first spray I was quite taken aback by how good it smells. It really reminds me of Penhaligon's Cairo on first spray, it settles down really nicely too, but diverges from Cairo to nearer Guerlain's Oud Essentiel, in fact the mid/dry down is almost identical to Oud Essentiel. Considering that Cairo is about ten times the price of this you'd be churlish to complain about value for money. \\\\nProjection wise, it's not totally in your face but still pretty good. I do get exceptionally good longevity with it - though I'm not sure if that's attributable to my particular skin PH factor or the batch of the bottle I purchased. In fact, I was so pleased with it's performance that I bought another bottle.\\\", \\\"I heard good things about this so blind bought due the the lack of a tester in M & S Bristol. I wish I hadn't. Weak performer so much so its not worth the investment. Really dissapointed. As too the smell difficult to say as it sits so close to the skin. I would say there is a a problem with this fragrance. Just so you know my batch is 1356081. \\\\nupdate.....once i had regained my composure... a very light oud with some floral powdery notes but really poor performance very little projection\\\", \\\"The top is the best. Too bad it doesn't last long.

Like seriously, and I\\'m an adult cis-gender straight(-ish) man saying this. \\nI think some things that are immature, dark and not seen as \"PC\" can be very fun to joke about, but the thing with this is that it\\'s just like... not funny. in any way.  \\n@hexed: I get what you mean, but nah come on. Fragrances are universal, they\\'re for the women and men, gay people and straight people, cis-gendered and trans (+NB) people, saying that perfumes and fragrances are gay is very reductive and becomes almost as childish as the people doing this shit in the first place.', 'Same as below, are the straighties here being so defensive simply because they chose a gay ass hobby aka collecting perfume, or....', \"The usual âthis smells likeâ homophobic links to âAnalâ âSlutâ âScatâ âInexcusable Evilâ etc etc perfumes every year a JPG PRIDE edition comes out!

This has no similarities or whatsoever to the Guerlain and Serge Lutens mentioned. \\\\nIt is a very cloying sweet synthetic amber that feels cheap and messy. Something you\\\\'d buy at any street market somewhere in Asia/South America (too bad we do not have a lively street market in the USA). If you want a nice and long lasting amber on a budget, go for Frank Olivier Amber. Black Oud has a soft projection for about an hour, then it sits close to skin for another 3-4 hours. I get a very, very faint oud in the drydown, but you gotta know what oud smells like to identify it. Cheap blind buy but not worth my money, in my opinion.', \\\"A new fave, blind acquired based on reviews here. This fragrance makes me never want to pay more than $20 for a scent ever again! Quality and performance of this 'cheapie' suit me better than all of the spendy niche ouds I have been considering (Montale, Roja, Nasomatto, Guerlain). A true oud, complete with acrid medicinal bite in the opening, Monotheme Black Oud mellows out to a politely wearable cool woody floral experience, light and clean where other perfumes bearing similar name and notes tend to be overbearingly dark and tarry. This is the only oud perfume I have tried (other than TF Oud Minerale, which hardly qulifies) that I would consider bringing out in warm Spring and Autumn weather. In the absence of any funky horse barn cast or overtly synthetic spoilers, the bitter oud note blends pleasantly with sandalwood, smoke, spices, and rose, lending the composition the faintest tinge of edgy danger, without the risk of rolling over into a body odor situation. On its own, this fragrance is elegant, subtle and yet distinctive for mature wearers of all genders. As an under layer, it successfully adds depth and niche-like performance quality to lighter fruit, citrus, aromatic, fougere, and floral perfumes. For mixology purposes, this will supercede my Demeter Oud, which smells more like black truffle in comparison. Definitely recommended for those who love both a good oud perfume and a great value.\\\", \\\"I found that one on price of 9 euros so I said.. Oud with 9 euros how good can it be? So it's reaaally good! I had compliments from the first time I wear it and everybody thought that it was expensive oudy fragrance! Sweet ambery oud great for cold nights and only 9 euros! Also good longevity and sillage! If you find it just buy it! It worths a lot more!\\\", \\\"REVIEW | 100 ml purchased from M&S \\\\nExcellente!!! ...as they say at the Ambassadors party. ;) \\\\nI blind bought this from M&S for only \\u00c2\\u00a317.00. On first spray I was quite taken aback by how good it smells. It really reminds me of Penhaligon's Cairo on first spray, it settles down really nicely too, but diverges from Cairo to nearer Guerlain's Oud Essentiel, in fact the mid/dry down is almost identical to Oud Essentiel. Considering that Cairo is about ten times the price of this you'd be churlish to complain about value for money. \\\\nProjection wise, it's not totally in your face but still pretty good. I do get exceptionally good longevity with it - though I'm not sure if that's attributable to my particular skin PH factor or the batch of the bottle I purchased. In fact, I was so pleased with it's performance that I bought another bottle.\\\", \\\"I heard good things about this so blind bought due the the lack of a tester in M & S Bristol. I wish I hadn't. Weak performer so much so its not worth the investment. Really dissapointed. As too the smell difficult to say as it sits so close to the skin. I would say there is a a problem with this fragrance. Just so you know my batch is 1356081. \\\\nupdate.....once i had regained my composure... a very light oud with some floral powdery notes but really poor performance very little projection\\\", \\\"The top is the best. Too bad it doesn't last long. This is a sweet honeyed vanilla oud; lovely and sweet but not long lasting for EDP.\\\", 'I have to disagree with several of the reviews here, I really like this, I get a nice balanced Amber/Oud drydown, the opening is a little punchy, but as it mellows it is so good, very soothing and distinctive, longevity and sillage are very good, exceptionally good value.', 'I tried this yesterday. Not very oud-y but really pretty nice. I liked it, musky and sweet but it didn\\\\'t strike me as a keeper. I may try it again before I buy it - that sometimes happens when I do more than one \\\"try\\\" I feel the love. And it\\\\'s not bad.', \\\"Hmmmm...there should be a lot to like here but sadly this misses the mark for me.  \\\\nFirstly I'm glad just to find Monotheme in stores, as these scents have alluded me for years now and finally I get to try them.  \\\\nStarts out with a peppery spice in the opening which for me was hugely promising but sadly doesn't last long and the promise fades along with my hopes about this fragrance. There's a definite labdanum and Amber vibe with a powdered floral feel and underpinned with woods. I have to say this just feels a little tired and slightly dated, almost granny like. \\\\nI found the performance to be reasonably good and this brand are obviously of some quality for the comparitably low asking price. \\\\nMy verdict is that Black our is a perfectly good fragrance just not my bag and if you are looking for oud although it's present I'd look elsewhere.\\\", 'profumo meraviglioso e persistente almeno 8 ore sulla mia pelle.la prima volta che l ho provato non credevo al mio naso praticamente quasi simile a tom ford noir ma con un prezzo super 14,9 eu. consiglio anche gli altri tre della serie Black Label sono uno migliore dell altro..', 'I tried this on today while out and about, I haven\\\\'t \\\"worn\\\" it properly yet but it is one I would like to explore further. It was being sold in Marks and Spencers in the UK at \\u00c2\\u00a322 for 100ml bottle.\\\\nTo my nose, in the bottle this is very oud-y and woody, with a pleasant soft warm amber and a slightly sweet floral - perhaps this is the labdanum - it is not a scent I am especially familiar with but based on the listed notes I am guessing that is what I am smelling. The geranium is also there but mild, gentle, taking a backseat.\\\\nThis smells fairy true to the bottle scent on my skin - I am quite fussy with ouds, some can be too much, overpowering, cold, and with a stale, musty smell. This one avoids this and soars into a light yet heady exotic sweet oud - not sweet like lollipops and fizzy drinks, more like sweet incense and soft spice. The amber adds a warm quality. \\\\nThis is a very nice composition, and one that I want to test properly when I get the chance.\\\\nUPDATE: I bought this as the price was so good and have worn it a few times now.\\\\nI find it a very gentle oud, an oud for westerners it is soft and not challenging at all. Quite powdery and rosy for the first couple of hours, with mild geranium and warm amber. After the first few hours this reminds me a lot of crabtree and evelyns nantucket briar, a little lighter and slightly rosier but it has many similarities on me. Longevity is about 8 hours with soft sillage.\\\\nI have found that as the weather starts to turn warmer the rose note becomes more pronounced to me, I think this might actucally work better in spring /summer.', 'Very spicy, almost unisex. Delicious, affordable, subtle and intringuing! Go for it, absolutely!', 'I discovered Monotheme fragrances a few days ago and smelled 4 of them . This is the only one I find nice as I like cloves , amber and heliothrope . It cannot have the depth of old perfumes as it is brand new but more pleasant anyway than many lollipops and dirty patchouli bullets . \\\\nIt is very inexpensive : 15 \\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac the big bottle .', \\\"This unisex scent makes me think of November evenings.  \\\\nEspecially 5th November and bonfires. \\\\nIt doesn't smell like Bvlgari Black, but makes me think about revisiting.\\\", 'I have to disagree with several of the reviews here, I really like this, I get a nice balanced Amber/Oud drydown, the opening is a little punchy, but as it mellows it is so good, very soothing and distinctive, longevity and sillage are very good, exceptionally good value.', 'This is nice. This is safe. Yet not in the sense that these words are typically used in the fragrance community. They can come off this way to those you interact with but at the same time it\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s the definition of how this makes me feel. It\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s clean, warm, and cozy. Give it around five minutes to dry down and you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll understand. It immediately takes my mind to wooden deck front porch in the middle of autumn. The sky is steel gray and the smell of a cool evening rain begins to hit moments before the actual drops fall to a slow serenade on the roof. The slight breeze calls for a freshly laundered quilt that has seen a life time of use. All while the wind continues to bring in notes of year long curated fire wood that brings promise of more warmth to come as aroma of spice cake flows out from the open kitchen window. Is it anything new or ground breaking? No. Is it comforting? Yes. Sometimes that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s all we need and for $20 I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll take that trip down memory lane time and again.', 'Very spicy, almost unisex. Delicious, affordable, subtle and intringuing! Go for it, absolutely!', 'A perfect slightly softer and lighter version of Guerlain Oud Essentiel to bath in.

Something you\\\\'d buy at any street market somewhere in Asia/South America (too bad we do not have a lively street market in the USA).

I get a very, very faint oud in the drydown, but you gotta know what oud smells like to identify it. Cheap blind buy but not worth my money, in my opinion.', \\\"A new fave, blind acquired based on reviews here. This fragrance makes me never want to pay more than $20 for a scent ever again! Quality and performance of this 'cheapie' suit me better than all of the spendy niche ouds I have been considering (Montale, Roja, Nasomatto, Guerlain). A true oud, complete with acrid medicinal bite in the opening, Monotheme Black Oud mellows out to a politely wearable cool woody floral experience, light and clean where other perfumes bearing similar name and notes tend to be overbearingly dark and tarry. This is the only oud perfume I have tried (other than TF Oud Minerale, which hardly qulifies) that I would consider bringing out in warm Spring and Autumn weather. In the absence of any funky horse barn cast or overtly synthetic spoilers, the bitter oud note blends pleasantly with sandalwood, smoke, spices, and rose, lending the composition the faintest tinge of edgy danger, without the risk of rolling over into a body odor situation. On its own, this fragrance is elegant, subtle and yet distinctive for mature wearers of all genders. As an under layer, it successfully adds depth and niche-like performance quality to lighter fruit, citrus, aromatic, fougere, and floral perfumes. For mixology purposes, this will supercede my Demeter Oud, which smells more like black truffle in comparison. Definitely recommended for those who love both a good oud perfume and a great value.\\\", \\\"I found that one on price of 9 euros so I said.. Oud with 9 euros how good can it be? So it's reaaally good! I had compliments from the first time I wear it and everybody thought that it was expensive oudy fragrance! Sweet ambery oud great for cold nights and only 9 euros! Also good longevity and sillage! If you find it just buy it! It worths a lot more!\\\", \\\"REVIEW | 100 ml purchased from M&S \\\\nExcellente!!! ...as they say at the Ambassadors party. ;) \\\\nI blind bought this from M&S for only \\u00c2\\u00a317.00. On first spray I was quite taken aback by how good it smells. It really reminds me of Penhaligon's Cairo on first spray, it settles down really nicely too, but diverges from Cairo to nearer Guerlain's Oud Essentiel, in fact the mid/dry down is almost identical to Oud Essentiel. Considering that Cairo is about ten times the price of this you'd be churlish to complain about value for money. \\\\nProjection wise, it's not totally in your face but still pretty good. I do get exceptionally good longevity with it - though I'm not sure if that's attributable to my particular skin PH factor or the batch of the bottle I purchased. In fact, I was so pleased with it's performance that I bought another bottle.\\\", \\\"I heard good things about this so blind bought due the the lack of a tester in M & S Bristol. I wish I hadn't. Weak performer so much so its not worth the investment. Really dissapointed. As too the smell difficult to say as it sits so close to the skin. I would say there is a a problem with this fragrance. Just so you know my batch is 1356081. \\\\nupdate.....once i had regained my composure... a very light oud with some floral powdery notes but really poor performance very little projection\\\", \\\"The top is the best. Too bad it doesn't last long. This is a sweet honeyed vanilla oud; lovely and sweet but not long lasting for EDP.\\\", 'I have to disagree with several of the reviews here, I really like this, I get a nice balanced Amber/Oud drydown, the opening is a little punchy, but as it mellows it is so good, very soothing and distinctive, longevity and sillage are very good, exceptionally good value.', 'I tried this yesterday.

And it\\\\'s not bad.', \\\"Hmmmm...there should be a lot to like here but sadly this misses the mark for me.  \\\\nFirstly I'm glad just to find Monotheme in stores, as these scents have alluded me for years now and finally I get to try them.  \\\\nStarts out with a peppery spice in the opening which for me was hugely promising but sadly doesn't last long and the promise fades along with my hopes about this fragrance. There's a definite labdanum and Amber vibe with a powdered floral feel and underpinned with woods.

The amber adds a warm quality. \\\\nThis is a very nice composition, and one that I want to test properly when I get the chance.\\\\nUPDATE: I bought this as the price was so good and have worn it a few times now.\\\\nI find it a very gentle oud, an oud for westerners it is soft and not challenging at all. Quite powdery and rosy for the first couple of hours, with mild geranium and warm amber. After the first few hours this reminds me a lot of crabtree and evelyns nantucket briar, a little lighter and slightly rosier but it has many similarities on me. Longevity is about 8 hours with soft sillage.\\\\nI have found that as the weather starts to turn warmer the rose note becomes more pronounced to me, I think this might actucally work better in spring /summer.'\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"full_description\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 21950,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Top Notes: passionfruit.

User Review: I loved this when I first tried it, but as my tastes have changed over the last couple of years, it's a little too sweet for me now. I like the base fragrance, but the floral sweetness is a bit overpowering. It's a great summer fragrance, though, and I continue to wear it on occasion.\\\", 'I think the problem with this fragrance for me is the passionfruit.

It\\\\'s not bad at all, I actually bought this from my aunt when she was selling Avon.

But now, it\\\\'s really just a meh scent to me. I\\\\'m up for a swap if anyone is interested. Sounds like it has its share of fans here on Fragantica!', \\\"Cheap & sweet fruity floral but I like it! \\\\nThe bottle is lovely. I like the floral petal thingie that can easily be worn as a scrunchie. Love the color scheme. This is nothing particularly special but it's as good for spring-summer season as can get. I live in Florida so I need these kind of fresh sweet fruity frags.  \\\\nAt the first spritz I get tropical fruit flavors of mango, peach, passion fruit and apricot. Then I get the rose and iris florals scents. There are more notes playing in the musical performance of this perfume than the notes that are mentioned/listed. There's definitely vanilla and amber and some powder notes. This is very girly and sugary and like a fruit candy scent perhaps too girlish for some wearers but not for me.  \\\\nMatches up with a cute mini dress bikini or casual top and shorts. Good for after a shower and the body lotion with the same scent gives the fragrance a bit of a body.  \\\\nDoesn't last too long but it's ok.\\\", \\\"Love this! It's such a well balanced fragrance; not too sweet, not too floral, not too tropical. I think maybe Avon was trying to mimic Escada fragrances based on the bottle shape and colors. This does not have that chemical smell that some of Avon's other fragrances have. It is not strong and projection is weak but I don't mind re-spraying considering I purchased this on eBay for about $7. But honestly, it is similar to other scents that I have spent $40+ on. Once again, you don't have to spend an arm and a leg to get a great fragrance! \\\\nI may try layering this with my other scents that contain some of these notes. \\\\nI really enjoy this one but you know what that means - Avon will most likely discontinue it.\\\", \\\"Got this today from my most recent order! I must say, it is amazingly pretty. Its soft and girly. To me its not that tropical, it almost reminds me of Heat Rush-like that cherry ish type smell...i dunno I'm terrible for trying to pick out certain notes. This is lovely though. I would say that it goes best for summer, or warmer weather. It has that marc Jacobs vibe to it-the light floral scents if you know what I mean!

Main Accords: citrus, woody, green, aromatic, fresh spicy. User Review: Limon de Cordoza is very nice. It opens with citrus and mint. There's a beautiful combination of bitter orange and mandarin that feels lemony with the mint and freesia. It's very light and uplifting. The sillage is intimate after about 20 minutes. It's suitable for day wear in the spring and summer.  \\\\nThe perfume is a lovely blend and very elegant. The vetiver and wood comes into the background after 20 minutes or so. 35 minutes in it's a combination of citrus, grass and mint. It reminds me of Carthusia's Mediteranneo except that Limon de Cordoza is done after about three hours whereas the Carthusia lasts longer. Both are fully genderless and unisex.\\\", 'The Different Company Limon de Cordoza is centered around the eponymous note of lemon and other citrus, but touched with bits of mint, vetiver, gaiac, freesia, and neroli. \\\\nIt\\\\'s predictably fresh, overall quite light, and nuanced, sharpened by the mint and vetiver, specifically, which prevent the fragrance from drifting into \\\"citrus-only\\\" or \\\"juicy, sweet citrus\\\" territory. \\\\nIt feels fresh but classy, exuberant but reserved, making for a versatile offering as far as gender and age. \\\\nPricing of $125 for 100ml walks the line between being excessive for the lack of performance and just right for a perfume of fine quality and energy, and a rather useful warm weather option. \\\\n7 out of 10', \\\"Very nice, summery, refreshing orange scent! It's very subtle. Office safe for 100%. It does not change at all. After many hours I can still smell the fresh orange opening. However, stillage is very soft. Basically, it's a typical skin-scent.\\\", \\\"Used a sample of this: \\\\nI loved this stuff. It was a freshly cut grass mixed with lemon with a great patchouli dry down.  \\\\nSadly, this is probably the most fleeting scent I have ever come across.

Perhaps at some point in the future.\\\", \\\"This smells like lemons. Big time. A huge, zesty burst of lemons. This will make it reminiscent of cleaning products since they tend to use lots of lemon for their scents. No big deal. If people are writing honest reviews, they'll say if a frag reminds them of something else. If it reminds someone of Lemon Pledge, then that's what they think of when they smell it, so obviously they'll say so in a review. There's no need for any fuss to be made about that.  \\\\nThere's a hint of a sweet orange underneath the lemon and a hint of carefully used pepper than doesn't make this tickle the nose, but instead just adds a bit of oomph to all that citrus.  \\\\nThe vetiver is very noticeable, but I can't say I get any patchouli or woods.  \\\\nIt leans too masculine for my personal taste, but I could see this working really well on a guy in the summer. It's bold and sparkling, but the vetiver offers a kind of cool shrug which makes it more nonchalant than most citrus scents I've tried.  \\\\nIt's pretty linear and longevity isn't wonderful (3-4 hours).  \\\\nOverall, a nice, masculine citrus that offers something a little new for citrus lovers but doesn't last long enough to be worth the price.\\\", \\\"Masculine scent with mucho lemon right out of the gate\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6but kindof like lemon over grilled meat. Has a very Greek kitchen feel (perhaps the combo of lemon and mint?).

Personally, when it comes to hesperidic fragrances, I prefer either more classic takes on the main theme such as several Guerlain's Eaus, Eau D'Hadrien, Chanel's Eau De Cologne (to name a few), or more avant-garde iterations a-la Comme Des Garcons Soda.

Something you\\\\'d buy at any street market somewhere in Asia/South America (too bad we do not have a lively street market in the USA). If you want a nice and long lasting amber on a budget, go for Frank Olivier Amber. Black Oud has a soft projection for about an hour, then it sits close to skin for another 3-4 hours. I get a very, very faint oud in the drydown, but you gotta know what oud smells like to identify it. Cheap blind buy but not worth my money, in my opinion.', \\\"A new fave, blind acquired based on reviews here. This fragrance makes me never want to pay more than $20 for a scent ever again! Quality and performance of this 'cheapie' suit me better than all of the spendy niche ouds I have been considering (Montale, Roja, Nasomatto, Guerlain). A true oud, complete with acrid medicinal bite in the opening, Monotheme Black Oud mellows out to a politely wearable cool woody floral experience, light and clean where other perfumes bearing similar name and notes tend to be overbearingly dark and tarry. This is the only oud perfume I have tried (other than TF Oud Minerale, which hardly qulifies) that I would consider bringing out in warm Spring and Autumn weather. In the absence of any funky horse barn cast or overtly synthetic spoilers, the bitter oud note blends pleasantly with sandalwood, smoke, spices, and rose, lending the composition the faintest tinge of edgy danger, without the risk of rolling over into a body odor situation. On its own, this fragrance is elegant, subtle and yet distinctive for mature wearers of all genders. As an under layer, it successfully adds depth and niche-like performance quality to lighter fruit, citrus, aromatic, fougere, and floral perfumes. For mixology purposes, this will supercede my Demeter Oud, which smells more like black truffle in comparison. Definitely recommended for those who love both a good oud perfume and a great value.\\\", \\\"I found that one on price of 9 euros so I said.. Oud with 9 euros how good can it be? So it's reaaally good! I had compliments from the first time I wear it and everybody thought that it was expensive oudy fragrance! Sweet ambery oud great for cold nights and only 9 euros! Also good longevity and sillage! If you find it just buy it! It worths a lot more!\\\", \\\"REVIEW | 100 ml purchased from M&S \\\\nExcellente!!! ...as they say at the Ambassadors party. ;) \\\\nI blind bought this from M&S for only \\u00c2\\u00a317.00. On first spray I was quite taken aback by how good it smells. It really reminds me of Penhaligon's Cairo on first spray, it settles down really nicely too, but diverges from Cairo to nearer Guerlain's Oud Essentiel, in fact the mid/dry down is almost identical to Oud Essentiel. Considering that Cairo is about ten times the price of this you'd be churlish to complain about value for money. \\\\nProjection wise, it's not totally in your face but still pretty good. I do get exceptionally good longevity with it - though I'm not sure if that's attributable to my particular skin PH factor or the batch of the bottle I purchased. In fact, I was so pleased with it's performance that I bought another bottle.\\\", \\\"I heard good things about this so blind bought due the the lack of a tester in M & S Bristol. I wish I hadn't. Weak performer so much so its not worth the investment. Really dissapointed. As too the smell difficult to say as it sits so close to the skin. I would say there is a a problem with this fragrance. Just so you know my batch is 1356081. \\\\nupdate.....once i had regained my composure... a very light oud with some floral powdery notes but really poor performance very little projection\\\", \\\"The top is the best. Too bad it doesn't last long.

This has no similarities or whatsoever to the Guerlain and Serge Lutens mentioned. \\\\nIt is a very cloying sweet synthetic amber that feels cheap and messy. Something you\\\\'d buy at any street market somewhere in Asia/South America (too bad we do not have a lively street market in the USA). If you want a nice and long lasting amber on a budget, go for Frank Olivier Amber. Black Oud has a soft projection for about an hour, then it sits close to skin for another 3-4 hours. I get a very, very faint oud in the drydown, but you gotta know what oud smells like to identify it. Cheap blind buy but not worth my money, in my opinion.', \\\"A new fave, blind acquired based on reviews here. This fragrance makes me never want to pay more than $20 for a scent ever again! Quality and performance of this 'cheapie' suit me better than all of the spendy niche ouds I have been considering (Montale, Roja, Nasomatto, Guerlain). A true oud, complete with acrid medicinal bite in the opening, Monotheme Black Oud mellows out to a politely wearable cool woody floral experience, light and clean where other perfumes bearing similar name and notes tend to be overbearingly dark and tarry. This is the only oud perfume I have tried (other than TF Oud Minerale, which hardly qulifies) that I would consider bringing out in warm Spring and Autumn weather. In the absence of any funky horse barn cast or overtly synthetic spoilers, the bitter oud note blends pleasantly with sandalwood, smoke, spices, and rose, lending the composition the faintest tinge of edgy danger, without the risk of rolling over into a body odor situation. On its own, this fragrance is elegant, subtle and yet distinctive for mature wearers of all genders. As an under layer, it successfully adds depth and niche-like performance quality to lighter fruit, citrus, aromatic, fougere, and floral perfumes. For mixology purposes, this will supercede my Demeter Oud, which smells more like black truffle in comparison. Definitely recommended for those who love both a good oud perfume and a great value.\\\", \\\"I found that one on price of 9 euros so I said.. Oud with 9 euros how good can it be? So it's reaaally good! I had compliments from the first time I wear it and everybody thought that it was expensive oudy fragrance! Sweet ambery oud great for cold nights and only 9 euros! Also good longevity and sillage! If you find it just buy it! It worths a lot more!\\\", \\\"REVIEW | 100 ml purchased from M&S \\\\nExcellente!!! ...as they say at the Ambassadors party. ;) \\\\nI blind bought this from M&S for only \\u00c2\\u00a317.00. On first spray I was quite taken aback by how good it smells. It really reminds me of Penhaligon's Cairo on first spray, it settles down really nicely too, but diverges from Cairo to nearer Guerlain's Oud Essentiel, in fact the mid/dry down is almost identical to Oud Essentiel. Considering that Cairo is about ten times the price of this you'd be churlish to complain about value for money. \\\\nProjection wise, it's not totally in your face but still pretty good. I do get exceptionally good longevity with it - though I'm not sure if that's attributable to my particular skin PH factor or the batch of the bottle I purchased. In fact, I was so pleased with it's performance that I bought another bottle.\\\", \\\"I heard good things about this so blind bought due the the lack of a tester in M & S Bristol. I wish I hadn't. Weak performer so much so its not worth the investment. Really dissapointed. As too the smell difficult to say as it sits so close to the skin. I would say there is a a problem with this fragrance. Just so you know my batch is 1356081. \\\\nupdate.....once i had regained my composure... a very light oud with some floral powdery notes but really poor performance very little projection\\\", \\\"The top is the best. Too bad it doesn't last long.

Not very oud-y but really pretty nice. I liked it, musky and sweet but it didn\\\\'t strike me as a keeper.

Sometimes that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s all we need and for $20 I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll take that trip down memory lane time and again.', 'I found this for cheap. I decided to jump in after looking at the \\\"reminds of\\\" section. It was a mistake, not a big one, but a mistake nonetheless. This has no similarities or whatsoever to the Guerlain and Serge Lutens mentioned. \\\\nIt is a very cloying sweet synthetic amber that feels cheap and messy. Something you\\\\'d buy at any street market somewhere in Asia/South America (too bad we do not have a lively street market in the USA). If you want a nice and long lasting amber on a budget, go for Frank Olivier Amber. Black Oud has a soft projection for about an hour, then it sits close to skin for another 3-4 hours. I get a very, very faint oud in the drydown, but you gotta know what oud smells like to identify it. Cheap blind buy but not worth my money, in my opinion.', \\\"A new fave, blind acquired based on reviews here. This fragrance makes me never want to pay more than $20 for a scent ever again! Quality and performance of this 'cheapie' suit me better than all of the spendy niche ouds I have been considering (Montale, Roja, Nasomatto, Guerlain). A true oud, complete with acrid medicinal bite in the opening, Monotheme Black Oud mellows out to a politely wearable cool woody floral experience, light and clean where other perfumes bearing similar name and notes tend to be overbearingly dark and tarry. This is the only oud perfume I have tried (other than TF Oud Minerale, which hardly qulifies) that I would consider bringing out in warm Spring and Autumn weather. In the absence of any funky horse barn cast or overtly synthetic spoilers, the bitter oud note blends pleasantly with sandalwood, smoke, spices, and rose, lending the composition the faintest tinge of edgy danger, without the risk of rolling over into a body odor situation. On its own, this fragrance is elegant, subtle and yet distinctive for mature wearers of all genders. As an under layer, it successfully adds depth and niche-like performance quality to lighter fruit, citrus, aromatic, fougere, and floral perfumes. For mixology purposes, this will supercede my Demeter Oud, which smells more like black truffle in comparison. Definitely recommended for those who love both a good oud perfume and a great value.\\\", \\\"I found that one on price of 9 euros so I said.. Oud with 9 euros how good can it be? So it's reaaally good! I had compliments from the first time I wear it and everybody thought that it was expensive oudy fragrance! Sweet ambery oud great for cold nights and only 9 euros! Also good longevity and sillage! If you find it just buy it! It worths a lot more!\\\", \\\"REVIEW | 100 ml purchased from M&S \\\\nExcellente!!! ...as they say at the Ambassadors party. ;) \\\\nI blind bought this from M&S for only \\u00c2\\u00a317.00. On first spray I was quite taken aback by how good it smells. It really reminds me of Penhaligon's Cairo on first spray, it settles down really nicely too, but diverges from Cairo to nearer Guerlain's Oud Essentiel, in fact the mid/dry down is almost identical to Oud Essentiel. Considering that Cairo is about ten times the price of this you'd be churlish to complain about value for money. \\\\nProjection wise, it's not totally in your face but still pretty good. I do get exceptionally good longevity with it - though I'm not sure if that's attributable to my particular skin PH factor or the batch of the bottle I purchased. In fact, I was so pleased with it's performance that I bought another bottle.\\\", \\\"I heard good things about this so blind bought due the the lack of a tester in M & S Bristol. I wish I hadn't. Weak performer so much so its not worth the investment. Really dissapointed. As too the smell difficult to say as it sits so close to the skin. I would say there is a a problem with this fragrance. Just so you know my batch is 1356081. \\\\nupdate.....once i had regained my composure... a very light oud with some floral powdery notes but really poor performance very little projection\\\", \\\"The top is the best. Too bad it doesn't last long. This is a sweet honeyed vanilla oud; lovely and sweet but not long lasting for EDP.\\\", 'I have to disagree with several of the reviews here, I really like this, I get a nice balanced Amber/Oud drydown, the opening is a little punchy, but as it mellows it is so good, very soothing and distinctive, longevity and sillage are very good, exceptionally good value.', 'I tried this yesterday. Not very oud-y but really pretty nice. I liked it, musky and sweet but it didn\\\\'t strike me as a keeper. I may try it again before I buy it - that sometimes happens when I do more than one \\\"try\\\" I feel the love. And it\\\\'s not bad.', \\\"Hmmmm...there should be a lot to like here but sadly this misses the mark for me.  \\\\nFirstly I'm glad just to find Monotheme in stores, as these scents have alluded me for years now and finally I get to try them.  \\\\nStarts out with a peppery spice in the opening which for me was hugely promising but sadly doesn't last long and the promise fades along with my hopes about this fragrance. There's a definite labdanum and Amber vibe with a powdered floral feel and underpinned with woods. I have to say this just feels a little tired and slightly dated, almost granny like. \\\\nI found the performance to be reasonably good and this brand are obviously of some quality for the comparitably low asking price. \\\\nMy verdict is that Black our is a perfectly good fragrance just not my bag and if you are looking for oud although it's present I'd look elsewhere.\\\", 'profumo meraviglioso e persistente almeno 8 ore sulla mia pelle.la prima volta che l ho provato non credevo al mio naso praticamente quasi simile a tom ford noir ma con un prezzo super 14,9 eu. consiglio anche gli altri tre della serie Black Label sono uno migliore dell altro..', 'I tried this on today while out and about, I haven\\\\'t \\\"worn\\\" it properly yet but it is one I would like to explore further.

Something you\\\\'d buy at any street market somewhere in Asia/South America (too bad we do not have a lively street market in the USA). If you want a nice and long lasting amber on a budget, go for Frank Olivier Amber. Black Oud has a soft projection for about an hour, then it sits close to skin for another 3-4 hours. I get a very, very faint oud in the drydown, but you gotta know what oud smells like to identify it. Cheap blind buy but not worth my money, in my opinion.', \\\"A new fave, blind acquired based on reviews here. This fragrance makes me never want to pay more than $20 for a scent ever again! Quality and performance of this 'cheapie' suit me better than all of the spendy niche ouds I have been considering (Montale, Roja, Nasomatto, Guerlain). A true oud, complete with acrid medicinal bite in the opening, Monotheme Black Oud mellows out to a politely wearable cool woody floral experience, light and clean where other perfumes bearing similar name and notes tend to be overbearingly dark and tarry. This is the only oud perfume I have tried (other than TF Oud Minerale, which hardly qulifies) that I would consider bringing out in warm Spring and Autumn weather. In the absence of any funky horse barn cast or overtly synthetic spoilers, the bitter oud note blends pleasantly with sandalwood, smoke, spices, and rose, lending the composition the faintest tinge of edgy danger, without the risk of rolling over into a body odor situation. On its own, this fragrance is elegant, subtle and yet distinctive for mature wearers of all genders. As an under layer, it successfully adds depth and niche-like performance quality to lighter fruit, citrus, aromatic, fougere, and floral perfumes. For mixology purposes, this will supercede my Demeter Oud, which smells more like black truffle in comparison. Definitely recommended for those who love both a good oud perfume and a great value.\\\", \\\"I found that one on price of 9 euros so I said.. Oud with 9 euros how good can it be? So it's reaaally good! I had compliments from the first time I wear it and everybody thought that it was expensive oudy fragrance! Sweet ambery oud great for cold nights and only 9 euros! Also good longevity and sillage! If you find it just buy it! It worths a lot more!\\\", \\\"REVIEW | 100 ml purchased from M&S \\\\nExcellente!!! ...as they say at the Ambassadors party. ;) \\\\nI blind bought this from M&S for only \\u00c2\\u00a317.00. On first spray I was quite taken aback by how good it smells. It really reminds me of Penhaligon's Cairo on first spray, it settles down really nicely too, but diverges from Cairo to nearer Guerlain's Oud Essentiel, in fact the mid/dry down is almost identical to Oud Essentiel. Considering that Cairo is about ten times the price of this you'd be churlish to complain about value for money. \\\\nProjection wise, it's not totally in your face but still pretty good. I do get exceptionally good longevity with it - though I'm not sure if that's attributable to my particular skin PH factor or the batch of the bottle I purchased. In fact, I was so pleased with it's performance that I bought another bottle.\\\", \\\"I heard good things about this so blind bought due the the lack of a tester in M & S Bristol. I wish I hadn't. Weak performer so much so its not worth the investment. Really dissapointed. As too the smell difficult to say as it sits so close to the skin. I would say there is a a problem with this fragrance. Just so you know my batch is 1356081. \\\\nupdate.....once i had regained my composure... a very light oud with some floral powdery notes but really poor performance very little projection\\\", \\\"The top is the best. Too bad it doesn't last long. This is a sweet honeyed vanilla oud; lovely and sweet but not long lasting for EDP.\\\", 'I have to disagree with several of the reviews here, I really like this, I get a nice balanced Amber/Oud drydown, the opening is a little punchy, but as it mellows it is so good, very soothing and distinctive, longevity and sillage are very good, exceptionally good value.', 'I tried this yesterday. Not very oud-y but really pretty nice. I liked it, musky and sweet but it didn\\\\'t strike me as a keeper. I may try it again before I buy it - that sometimes happens when I do more than one \\\"try\\\" I feel the love. And it\\\\'s not bad.', \\\"Hmmmm...there should be a lot to like here but sadly this misses the mark for me.  \\\\nFirstly I'm glad just to find Monotheme in stores, as these scents have alluded me for years now and finally I get to try them.  \\\\nStarts out with a peppery spice in the opening which for me was hugely promising but sadly doesn't last long and the promise fades along with my hopes about this fragrance. There's a definite labdanum and Amber vibe with a powdered floral feel and underpinned with woods. I have to say this just feels a little tired and slightly dated, almost granny like. \\\\nI found the performance to be reasonably good and this brand are obviously of some quality for the comparitably low asking price. \\\\nMy verdict is that Black our is a perfectly good fragrance just not my bag and if you are looking for oud although it's present I'd look elsewhere.\\\", 'profumo meraviglioso e persistente almeno 8 ore sulla mia pelle.la prima volta che l ho provato non credevo al mio naso praticamente quasi simile a tom ford noir ma con un prezzo super 14,9 eu. consiglio anche gli altri tre della serie Black Label sono uno migliore dell altro..', 'I tried this on today while out and about, I haven\\\\'t \\\"worn\\\" it properly yet but it is one I would like to explore further.

The geranium is also there but mild, gentle, taking a backseat.\\\\nThis smells fairy true to the bottle scent on my skin - I am quite fussy with ouds, some can be too much, overpowering, cold, and with a stale, musty smell. This one avoids this and soars into a light yet heady exotic sweet oud - not sweet like lollipops and fizzy drinks, more like sweet incense and soft spice. The amber adds a warm quality. \\\\nThis is a very nice composition, and one that I want to test properly when I get the chance.\\\\nUPDATE: I bought this as the price was so good and have worn it a few times now.\\\\nI find it a very gentle oud, an oud for westerners it is soft and not challenging at all. Quite powdery and rosy for the first couple of hours, with mild geranium and warm amber. After the first few hours this reminds me a lot of crabtree and evelyns nantucket briar, a little lighter and slightly rosier but it has many similarities on me. Longevity is about 8 hours with soft sillage.\\\\nI have found that as the weather starts to turn warmer the rose note becomes more pronounced to me, I think this might actucally work better in spring /summer.', 'Very spicy, almost unisex. Delicious, affordable, subtle and intringuing! Go for it, absolutely!', 'I discovered Monotheme fragrances a few days ago and smelled 4 of them .

The sky is steel gray and the smell of a cool evening rain begins to hit moments before the actual drops fall to a slow serenade on the roof.
