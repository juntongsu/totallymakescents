What I most like about it is that it is still modern and does not smell out of date. I think if you knew this from back in the day, you‚Äôll appreciate it massively. But I also think that if this is completely new to you the scent will work its magic. It‚Äôs a hit and I can‚Äôt wait for perfumery to move back to this aromatic freshness and away from the sweet oud mess that currently dominates.  10/10.', ""Fierce is a bright, fresh, lemony scent balanced out by a subtle woody undertone. It‚Äôs clean, non-intrusive, and extremely wearable. It's lemon done right without smelling like household cleaner or synthetic toilet spray. The more I explore fragrances, the more I find myself enjoying these cheapie options over some designer, niche, or indie scents. And it makes sense. They‚Äôre designed to be inoffensive and universally appealing. Fierce is no exception. It projects like a beast out of the gate. Unfortunately, the EDC concentration means longevity is where it completely fails. After about an hour, it noticeably begins to fade, which is a shame given how good it smells upfront. If this were re-released as a parfum, it‚Äôd be an easy buy in my book. It‚Äôs still one of the most balanced citrus scents I‚Äôve come across: not sharp, not sour, not overpowering. Just fresh, crisp, and approachable. A good scent for the price. But its lackluster performance makes it hard to justify owning unless you plan to reapply every single hour."", 'Got a small 10ml decant REF# 16963 with production 232F-X from August 2018 for a very good price (already way past its ""expiration""). Smells nothing special IMO, not sure what makes people like this specially. Maybe my opinion on this scent is not biased because I never entered A&F store in my life I don\'t have the ""nostalgic"" memory associated with this perfume. Maybe I need to let it breath a little more after the 1st couple of sprays to see if it improves the longevity/performance. For the price I got it, nothing to complain, will probably pass it out to the young men in my house.', 'Easy to dismiss if you are a niche snob, but this is amazing. I‚Äôd much rather be smelling this in the malls than bloody nuclear woody-ambers.', 'This is good, I have Mont Blanc Legend edt and edp . For some reason this is better. Legend edt & edp smells just like it but the edt is more fruitier and edp smells more rounded with the leather note but it‚Äôs just 2 mature.

It felt like heaven. I loved the style of the clothes and the atmosphere of the air-conditioned, dark stores with full of Fierce smell.', 'Interesting fragrance - it does change on exhale and inhale. Impressively complex yet clean - love the slight fir/musky kick at the end.', ""I'm sniffing this right now.. What a beautiful scent; It's not loud, obnoxious, but subtle-sweet, mysterious, book-nerd sexy. This is perfect for those who prefer milder scent over louder scent.  I would say this is perfect for spring or when summer is just about trailing off to fall weather.  The one I have is older bottle and I'm tempted to try the newer version in 150ml in backup.  8/10 scent Also very affordable at the discounters Ideal season: Spring, Late summer/early fall"", ""My thoughts about Fierce have been updated. I said that Legends is the most useful Fierce DNA perfume. Go ahead. I got a bottle of Fierce with better performance. Yes, it may have a very simple scent profile, but who cares. It is very young, clean and dynamic. It makes me feel very positive when I wear it. It has a delicious musk-based, aromatic and woody DNA. The fir note in it is in great harmony with the musk.  I don't know if it is because of the compliments I get from outside, I started to think that it is a very perfect scent. I can easily say that I have never received as many compliments from women about any perfume as I have from Fierce. I think every woman who is not very interested in perfumes likes simple and clean scents in a man."", ""Revisited this in store today for the first time in aaages. Call me crazy but it almost feels like... They brought the original version back...? üëÄ The last bottle I had 10 or so years ago had a slightly yellowish juice and was an obvious reformulation. Today's test smelled a lot more like what I remember the OG to be. If that's the case, I gotta grab one."", ""Like others in here, I've smelled hundreds of men's fragrances. This is an iconic smell that's as good as any fragrance for men ever created. Granted, my bottle is at least 10 years old and so I can't speak on newer juice. Perhaps they've reformulated it somewhat because I see others saying that it's weak. That's definitely not true in my case. This is perhaps the best musk fragrance of all time. Better in my opinion than Creed Aventus, which the House of Creed has definitely reformulated and destroyed. It's sweet, but not too sweet. Musky but not to the point of animalic. Woody but not too woody or green. The only real thing that's probably held this back in the mind's of many is the original advertising campaign and the brand itself, who directed its stores to pump it throughout the various quadrants of the mall where it could be found."", 'Bought a bottle, year old batch. Smells very synthetic but i love it. Performance is terrible but i can find it very cheap so ill spray every two hours.', ""Fierce is a versatile fragrance that can be used any season of the year, day or night and for most occasions. It doesn't make a statement - just sort of blends in and smells pleasant. Easy grab for most guys. Starts out fresh and dries down to a fresh woody accord and also synthetic. Very similar to two I already own: Legend EdP and Skulls & Roses for Men. Being a cologne, the performance is on the weaker side. My recommendation would be to go for Legend EdP which is stronger and longer lasting or Skulls & Roses which has slightly better performance and a much more entertaining bottle, all for a lower price."", ""I really like this one. It's final base reminds me of Jimmy Choo Man Blue and a few others Choo has, which I love. I can't wear Choo though because the spice is too harsh for me. This seems to be light on that,which is why I'll get a bottle."", 'mm sexy', 'I hate it so much, a friend of mine is all hyped up about this and montblanc legend edp. Sais they are identical. And while i kinda like legend, Fierce smells infinitely cheaper with this annoying iris type note which is simply intolerable. The difference between these two colognes is the reason why i cant stand Fierce, dunno exactly what it is. Yuck. If you are a man who wants an aromatic fougere, friendly advice is avoid this shit please. Get terre d‚Äôhermes or something like thatüëç', 'Shayes. The bottle doesnt show the nekked dude anymore. Very nice looking bottles now with no images! Fwiw', ""I am a middle aged male, married, 3 kids.  I like the scent profile (this is from my era) but I can't bring myself to buy this because of the bottle with a young man pulling his pants down in the front. I don't want it as part of my collection in my closet. Just. Can't. Do. It.  It's that simple: doesn't matter what the frag smells like, it's an unfortunate pass for me. Montblanc Legend EDT, EDP and Azzaro Sport (as a weaker performing option) are all in the same DNA. I have owned all three."", 'Welcoming smell but performance suck....', 'This is my scent for today, I‚Äôve been working in the goods in section where it‚Äôs not air conditioned or any breeze blowing in, two other staff members walked in and said it smells nice in here! One said immediately ‚Äúlynx Africa‚Äù the other one said ‚Äúclean linen‚Äù  Btw I applied this at around 7:30 this morning and the guys smelt me around 14:30! My bottle is a recent 200ml batch. This isn‚Äôt as powerful as it once was but this is obviously still no slouch from the experience I‚Äôve just had. About 3-5 sprays as well btw', 'Is this the same as fierce eau de cologne? Looks the exact same and released the same year. Just looks like a different bottle', 'I‚Äôm an ‚Äò01 baby so pretty much the first half of my generation like myself are the last to have experienced this scent along with the old Abercrombie stores before they changed them (R.I.P.). I‚Äôve tried all of the montblanc iterations and they don‚Äôt quite capture the magic of the original. Also was my first ever cologne so it holds a special spot in my heart. Update: I did a single spray of a newer tester bottle in the store and I can still very faintly smell it after about 20 hours. Although I haven‚Äôt gotten a chance to shower yet I think it‚Äôs very impressive for an eau de cologne. Don‚Äôt worry about reformulations just go grab a bottle right now, I believe they still have a sale on the website', ""It's 2004 and your mom is dragging you through JCPenny's and Macy's. To keep you quiet she got you Wetzel's Pretzels' cinnamon bites and a Coke.

The only worry in your life is who you should use your Masterball on, and that school is starting again soon.  That's what this scent is, in a bottle. And it's magical."", ""This has been my signature scent for a long time, in my 20s I became a frag-head but then discovered this and ignored all my other fragrances for many years to come. 20 years later, the fire of fragrance was relit inside of me and I started collecting fragrances again (now with more disposable income). It's been a fun couple of years trying all sorts of fragrances, from cheapies to ultra-niche, my nose has developed greatly having smelled and worn over 200 fragrances in the past years. Today, with a more refined nosed came back and applied FIERCE thinking it would be a somewhat simple and basic scent. Boy was I wrong! Fierce is a chameleonic fragrance, it smells different if different people use it but also smells different when you yourself use it at different times. Now I can appreciate the complexity of the fragrance, the opening notes, the drydown, the sillage, everything is beautiful in its own right."", ""it's stil the classic and beast fierce!‚ù§Ô∏è"", 'Bleu de chanel & Lyric man & The one threesome.

It's spicy enough to give it some nice projection and character. It's a scent that can be worn for several situations as it's intimate, refreshing, and of course, nostalgic. It's one of a few scents where it smells one way when you're breathing in, and it smells different when you're exhaling, so it's got complexity. Something else I appreciate about this is, is that it knows what it is and is not afraid to stand out. I think there are several colognes that are just trying to be well blended and not stand out too much. This is just so memorable with its sweetness and musk. The performance is disappointing; it becomes a skin scent after two hours and undetectable after three. Really wish they come out with a flanker that can last 4+ hours. 8.4/10"", ""To 'hazique', how can this be a dupe of Mont Blanc Legend? This was released nine years prior. If anything, Mont Blanc Legend is a dupe of this. Weird comment."", 'I\'ve been wearing this for about 2 weeks, and I\'m just addicted. Instant confidence booster. Fresh, nostalgic, hot! Sure, it\'s ""traditionally masculine"", but anyone can wear this. Also love using it after the gym.', 'Fresh, clean, gentle, humble and mysterious', ""Clean, masculine, youthful, fun, flirty scent. I love the strong citrus, aquatic opening supported by woody notes. After a few seconds, the floral notes break through. Super pleasant and universally loved fragrance. The retail price is too high for it being an EDC, but understandable because there's something so unique and nostalgic about this scent. This is definitely a hot guy scent, easy to wear anytime & anywhere, but especially suitable for warm, casual settings. I bought a Fierce and flankers sampler set a year ago and wish they were still selling the Confidence version (fruitier, sweeter). I'm keeping my eyes on this one to see if I can get it on a deep discount."", 'Legendary - timeless piece of history that everyone should smell at-least once or keep in the rotation.

They had the nectar of the gods and decided to dilute it down. If you own a batch prior to 2016, you‚Äôre essentially sitting on a pot of gold.  The new formulation is like going back to an ex that can still throw her neck back, but her looks and personality are a former shell of herself', ""The scent of an early 2000s slasher movie. This will make you smell like the jock star quarterback of the high school football team who gets stabbed by the masked killer right after getting lucky with the blonde-haired head cheerleader with the big bouncy D Cups.  A stone cold classic right here. Also, this is like catnip to Gen Y and older Gen Z women. I swear the scent of Fierce is somehow hardcoded into Gen Y women's brainwaves as an aphrodisiac. Makes for a great gym frag if you don't overspray."", ""Gfited this for Christmas, seems like the bottles no longer have the torso on it, maybe this is foreshadowing for the formulation change, because last time I had this bottle was in 2020 and I swear it lasted longer than it does now. Nevertheless the scent itself remains the same: Safe, musky freshness. What I always found interesting about Fierce is that despite all the notes listed, I couldn't pinpoint a few notes, it's just overall musky to me. But that's what I like about this scent, every collection needs a safe dumb-reach that you know will make you smell clean, you won't offend anyone with this and it will go with any casual outfit so for that alone, it makes it worthy. Don't buy retail for this, it tends to go on sale on their website every few months. 8/10 for me still, nostalgic scent that smells like a mall."", 'This perfume is fresh masculinity in a bottle. Familiar scent for most people and most people will like it. Not wearable at night or during winter.', ""My father would always wear fierce for casual outings, and I love the scent on him or anyone else for that matter. However, I myself cannot stand the overwhelmingly musky and woody base notes that cling to the skin long after the top and middle notes have faded. Everyone says I smell great in it, but I have struggled to wear it because I'm just sensitive to the scent. I thought this scent would be a home run for me, but it goes to show you should always try the cologne on yourself, not a test strip if possible. Overall, 3/5, with one star removed for personal taste and the other for short longevity. I recommend for casual summer and fall evenings (not a work or formal scent). Buy if you are very masculine, or enjoy a musky, woody cologne. Definitely be prepared to reapply for any outing longer than two hours."", ""Every generation has some things that just remind them of their coming-of-age, Fierce is one of those things.  With that said^, this is what hot guys smelled like in my teens. It was worn by all sorts, and there were many similar fragrances to be found in the mall around the same time. Anchor Blue (the original for men) was one. It's really fresh, kind of astringent, SUPER musky (clean musk though), and herbaceous in a really light manner, not heavily herbal or barbershop-y. Extremely fresh, and the florals here don't play much of a role. I could be biased of course (especially when it pertains to this frag), but this smells very decidedly masculine (who cares though, wear what you like).  The thing is though...I always thought this smelled salty back in the 2000s, and I smell a lot of salt now as well. It's a very clean sort of salt, and it combines with the musk to create a super *white&fresh* effect. Though, the base notes (the vetiver isn't natural smelling) also serve to keep this a warm temperatured fragrance, and somehow quite inviting in an oddly compelling way. I really just love this, it's incredible appealing to women, and I'm no exception. It really snaps me back to a certain place and time whenever I smell it."", ""It's fresh, floral, musky, woody, masculine, year around, day or night perfume with excellent longevity and sillage for an EDC.

Thanks for reading this."", 'You cant go wrong with this if your a simple guy looking for a lot of scent at a affordable price. Just do it', 'Iconic, sexy, youthful, woody musk scent. I find this scent so addictive.', 'As someone who used to work in Abercrombie when I was younger, this smell is very nostalgic to me. Pleasant, masculine, fourgere, aromatic. Of course it appeals more to a younger audience and is not very complex, but I think it is overall a great scent that can fit to any occasion and time of the year. Personally, I like it, maybe because of the memories it evokes.', ""This is still one of the very best if not the single best fresh/aquatic/clean fragrance for men on the planet. The old one might have been a little better smelling, better performing, but don't bother buying pre-2011 batches. It is a huge waste of money and time. This stuff overperforms as it is, and people complaining about bad performance are nose-deaf. Women are obsessed with this scent, and it doesn't matter how old you are within reason. Everyone should own this and give it the occasional try as their nose develops, because it WILL change for you, and it is probably the most mass-appealing fragrance for men. I've bought and sold it a few times, but finally keeping it for good, because I understand how to wear it without it being too piercing, and it is by far the best execution of this DNA that there is. If you can, get on ebay and buy as many bottles of Fierce Intense as you can, because it is a steal at 50USD (idgaf that it was 15USD two years ago. Those bottles were leaky a lot of the time and the past is gone, my friend) and it is only going to get more expensive, because the scent character there is irreplaceable. They are different enough to more than justify owning both, and they are both utter and absolute masterpieces that have not been properly replicated to my knowledge, though many have tried. The most popular is Percival, and it is close, but it is very noticeably more powdery and floral and not as masculine or generally pleasing at all, in my opinion. I have the supposedly stronger 78%alc. batch, and it performs, but it is not a proper replacement for Fierce in its scent character. A big reason why old Fierce was so good in profile and performance was because the majority of the aroma molecules were iso E super, so just get some of that and spray them on together. They do go well together. My main point is that this fragrance is ludicrously underrated because most people into fragrances (representing a tiny minority of all people) think it has a bad rep because of Abercrombie, malls, and douche bags who oversprayed it 20 years ago. Don't let that get to you, because if you just don't overspray and don't be a douche bag, you too can enjoy maybe the best fresh fragrance for men that you can buy. I prefer the Intense version and bought 13 bottles so far, but it's still on ebay from some reputable sellers if you have the desire to try it, and I strongly urge you to do so."", 'Generic, Givenchy For Men Only, some of the newer Armani, Coach, etc ones.

So this is what MB Legend, Axe Apollo and Percival clone huh? Yup they were on point with the scent profile, but honestly this is way smoother to my nose and more pleasant without the chemical undertone. Yeah performance is pretty bad due to it being an eau de cologne, but I only wear this during spring when I go skating so I don't need it to last a long time at all. While not unique anymore, I still love the scent profile, so I'll give it an 8.5/10."", ""My first real fragrance.

This is youth in a bottle, but I also think that older guys and men can pull it off. It is loud and demand attention and confidence. I find it very masculine and it is probably the one, that has given me the most compliments. Whenever I wear it I get pulled back to my younger self as a teenager, and remember all the good memories I had with my friends. I don‚Äôt wear it as often anymore, but when I do, it‚Äôs with a great pleasure. I find this fragrance to be timeless and not dated at all.

If you‚Äôve ever walked through an Abercrombie store and wondered what that pervasive, almost-too-intense scent was, you‚Äôre in for a treat. Spoiler alert: It‚Äôs Fierce, and it‚Äôs about to make you feel like a high school heartthrob, whether you‚Äôre in the mood or not. The Scent Imagine you‚Äôve just walked into the Abercrombie store at the height of its popularity, and the scent is so strong it could be considered a form of chemical warfare. That‚Äôs Fierce. The bottle itself is about as subtle as a neon sign in a blackout. It‚Äôs a straightforward glass rectangle with a little metal plaque that screams, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here, and I‚Äôm ready to party.‚Äù Fierce opens with a burst of citrus and herbal notes that smack you in the face like a group of rowdy teenagers shouting, ‚ÄúYOLO!‚Äù You‚Äôve got a mix of lemon, lime, and a dash of sea breeze, making you feel like you‚Äôve just been tossed into a pool party without the water. As it develops, you‚Äôre greeted by a heart of spicy jasmine and rose‚Äîthink of it as the olfactory equivalent of a faux-casual high-five from a bro you haven‚Äôt seen in years. Finally, the base notes of sandalwood, musk, and oakmoss come through like a warm, yet slightly aggressive hug. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôve spent the day flexing in the gym and getting in a few too many fist bumps. Longevity Fierce has the staying power of that one track on your playlist you can‚Äôt escape. It hangs around for a solid chunk of the day, neither disappearing after lunch nor overstaying its welcome. You‚Äôll find it lingering on your clothes and your soul, like a catchy but annoying tune that‚Äôs just too infectious to let go. It‚Äôs reliable, but not the kind of cologne that‚Äôs going to make you forget about it. Sillage This fragrance projects with the subtlety of a foghorn. It‚Äôs got a medium projection‚Äîenough to let people know you‚Äôve arrived without causing a stampede. It‚Äôs like being the life of the party without being the guy who tries too hard. You‚Äôll get noticed, but you won‚Äôt be so overwhelming that people start eyeing the exits. Uniqueness There‚Äôs no denying it: Fierce is as unique as a mixtape from a high school prom. It‚Äôs got a signature scent that you either love or find oddly familiar, like a favorite old TV show that you can‚Äôt quite put your finger on. It‚Äôs not groundbreaking, but it‚Äôs certainly memorable. If you‚Äôre looking for a fragrance that screams ‚ÄúAbercrombie,‚Äù you‚Äôve hit the jackpot. Versatility Fierce is versatile in a ‚Äúlet‚Äôs wear this to every casual event ever‚Äù kind of way. It‚Äôs perfect for hanging out with friends, hitting up the gym, or strolling through the mall. For more formal events or quiet dinners, it might feel a bit out of place, like wearing a party hat to a board meeting. It‚Äôs best suited for when you want to project that youthful, energetic vibe. Final Thoughts Fierce is a fragrance that‚Äôs been the olfactory equivalent of high school pep rallies and college parties. It‚Äôs bold, assertive, and unapologetically youthful, with a mix of citrus, floral, and woodsy notes that make a statement. It‚Äôs not the most subtle scent, but it gets the job done, making you feel like the star of your own coming-of-age film. If you‚Äôre ready to channel your inner teenager and make a lasting impression, Fierce is your go-to.', 'Just want to drop here and share a little love for this icon. I‚Äôve had some great years and memories with this. Countless days in my fragrance journey started with this bad boy.

Lo primero q dire es q es de ignorantes hablar de cualquier perfume si no lo has tenido y para mi los decants no cuentan como q lo tuvistes ya q el perfume pierde parte de sus atributos al cambiarlo de su botella a la de un decant,si no tuvistes Fierce tu opinion no vale nada,asi q hablen de cualquier perfume cuando lo hallan tenido pq de lo contrario estarias hablando sin saber y eso es ridiculo!! Ahora en cuanto a Fierce les puedo asegurar q ningun perfume tuvo el impacto q tuvo Fierce ya q les garantizo q cuando esto salio todas pero todas las mujeres daban lo q fuera pq su hombre oliera a Fierce,te digo q todas y 20 a√±os despues todavia da de q hablar este perfume,si no fuera cierto no tuvieramos a una casa como lo es Parfun De Marly clonando a Fierce con su carisimo Percival de PDM y eso q PDM es una casa NICHO,sin contar las demas casas de perfumes q han clonado Fierce!!! Este perfume marco un antes y un despues en la perfumeria,tuve Fierce cuando salio y desde entonces lo he tenido en mi coleccion,yo tuve los primeros lotes y actualmente tengo un lote 2022,han habido cambios? Pues si pero nada q yo pueda decir q ya no es lo mismo,el tema de.las formulaciones es mas complejo de lo q piensan,ya q a la hora de hacer nuevos lotes probablemente no encuentren exactamente los mismos ingredientes q usaron para los primeros lotes y tengan q comprar lo q este disponible y de ahi es q vienen peque√±os cambios en los perfumes,tambien las agencias encargadas de monitorial la perfumeria va creando leyes y normas q en muchas ocaciones prohiben ciertos imgredientes q tendrias q reemplazar por otros y eso resulta en cambios en el aroma y asi sucecivamente!!! Fierce es una de las botellas q mas he comprado desde q salio,la botella q tengo actualmente seria la numero 8 a lo largo de 20 a√±os,asi q puedo hablar de este perfume sin temor a equivocarme Este perfume es fenomenal y a las mujeres no se pq rayos les facina desde q salio esto fue top seller en su epoca y fue top seller por muchos a√±os corridos, En mi la botella q tengo me da 8 horas bien luego de eso pasa a ser un aroma de piel pero dentro de las primeras 8 horas me da 2 de proyeccion solida no beast mode pero se siente a buena distancia algunos 3 a 4 metros luego se recoje poco a poco hasta quedar en una busbuja q se siente a 10 pulgadas de la piel,cualquiera q se te acerque sentira tu perfume bien clarito!! Fierce como dije marco toda una generacion y marco un antes y un despues en la perfumeria!! Para mi es un 8/10', 'Fierce Abercrombie & Fitch was released in 2002 and I just tried it recently. Something undeniable is that the aroma is one of the most copied and recognizable in the history of perfumery, and because despite having barely tried it, I have been able to smell many fragrances inspired by it, to name a few Legend Montblanc, Tous Man Intense, Perry Ellis 2018, Azzaro Sport, etc. Speaking in particular about Fierce, it is an aromatic, woody, floral and musky fragrance. In its opening it has citrus fruits and some aromatic elements, a little aquatic. As the minutes pass, you perceive a kind of lavender, sandalwood, musk and perhaps sage that give it the characteristic clean aroma that made it so popular. Fierce is a daytime fragrance, one of those that puts me in a good mood, to be used at any time of the year, outdoors, at school or in the office. Its longevity was a maximum of 5 hours. with an almost low sillage, very close to the skin to perceive its aroma. The aroma is still pleasant and attractive, however there are so many fragrances inspired by it, that probably only you will know that you bring Fierce, because I doubt that anyone would know if you brought any of its inspirations, which are sometimes cheaper, even so for the who have used it since it was launched, I am sure that they will prefer it over others, but for those who have not known it since then I only recommend buying it unless they find it at a good price, otherwise with one of the mentioned fragrances they will find a good alternative.', ""Great classic. Sharp, fresh, and unforgivingly masculine. One of my all time favorites. If anyone's looking for a supposed pre-reformulation dupe of the original Fierce, try out Alexandria Fragrance's Ferocity. Recently got a bottle and it smells woodier, stronger, and more refined than the current batches of Fierce. Can't say anything about it matching the original Fierce since I never smelled that one before but it does smell better than the 2020 batch I own imo."", 'Sharp and clean scent.

I've tried it after experiencing scents like Parfums de Marly Percival and Montblanc Legend, and while I can see its appeal, to me feels a bit overshadowed by it's modern counterparts, most noteworthy Percival which beats Fierce and Legend in every department (smell, projection, longevity, etc.). Still, I understand why it was popular. I love the fragrance DNA of Fierce, as it set the stage for modern fragrances and remains a timeless choice. You can still rock it confidently today. Also, it's worth noting that the updated bottle design is a welcome change from the previous tacky one."", 'I know people like to make fun of it, but this stuff is really good. Maybe a tad overpriced with average performance, but never underestimate the power of smelling fresh/clean. I haven\'t tried Legend, but if it is close, I\'d get that since you can get it for a 3rd of the price. I was at camp a few years ago and a friend of mine put this on right after taking a shower. We were talking to some friends and a girl in the group literally stopped him mid-sentence to say, ""I\'m sorry but you smell SO good. Oh my God.""  Bought a bottle as soon as I got home and never looked back.', 'They said: ""oh u have a perfume with a hot guy in the commercial? we put him right on the bottle."" and THAT\'s fierce. Total icon perfume. Defined a generation regardless of anyone\'s option of it. It represented something. There was, and IS a culture around this fragrance today. it made an impact. It was the young hot guy choice of the time. Today, it comes across as vintage, what do you expect?', 'The bottle looks ass', ""Very Very sexy in the opening 15-20 mins because that's how much it lasts. 10-12 sprays all over your fresh out of shower naked body will make you feel super sexy and confident.

Longevity is poor for the sexiness this fragrance delivers. Worth atleast one purchase!!"", ""So THIS is that mall smell that I spent my entire youth getting hit in the face with!  And I'm into it. Smells like a Devil May Cry character. I smell this and I'm immediately greeted with a mixture of fresh laundry and sexy, high quality sweetness.  Immediate MySpace vibes, iPod commercials. Even after reformulations and several dupes clones, this is still a monster. Opening is clean-smelling, sexy laundry. Youthful. Pretty good gym scent actually. I'm into it. The florals are so background, you're actually more so getting a soapy aquatic for men with a hint of fruit (courtesy of the cassis). Definitely was a reference for Creed when they were creating Aventus. Drydown smells surprisingly modern, clean, fresh, sweet. My favorite 'shower gel' style fragrance because it's actually deeper than that and pretty sexy. Speaking of sexy, the bottle is even more sus than the Le Male bottles. Well done."", 'Just got a new bottle with the current batch. I sprayed it on before bed and 6 hours later it‚Äôs still there unlike some other fragrances that are EDPs..this smells a million times better than Mont Blanc legend. It‚Äôs fresh, little sweet, a little woody, nice and masculine.

Yeah right. Actually no. This is that Drakkar Noir type stuff. It's like an old shavinggel, for old men. Pack that with Young Naked Fitboy and the Fierce saga is born."", ""Been waiting YEARS for them to finally change the presentation, so I went ahead and picked up a bottle in the new packaging. This stuff is far superior to Legend, its smoother, sexier and sweeter. Love rocking this since its not so popular anymore, and its still modern. The irony is that since literally everything smells the same these days, you actually smell unique wearing this stuff. Crazy, right? Also, the new presentation is awesome. It's super sleek and the cap is a decently heavy metal."", 'I wish the man on the bottle had bigger nipples. Then it would be my to-cum-for fragrance !', ""I'm sorry but this smells exactly like cheap aftershave. Would be good for the younger ones if it was cheaper"", ""It might be aging, but it'll never get old. It's really just attractive and manly, but clean, musk with some soft fir for brightness. It's simple, but somehow untouched - which makes it pretty timeless."", 'For teenage boys and those who came of age in the 2000s, this scent is the GOAT. My scent preferences have skewed to the more niche, high-end and considerably more expensive in recent years, but there‚Äôs still nothing like a bottle of Fierce. The 2000s will never die, so long as this scent lives on. Just one gentle whiff of this (not that there is anything remotely gentle about this fragrance, as you can smell it a mile away ‚Äì and I mean that in the best possible way), and you‚Äôre instantly transported back to Abercrombie & Fitch in a 2000s era mall. Some say this has been reformulated to blandness but, no, it‚Äôs still all here. Pure nostalgia. Black and white images of shirtless toned men, and pumping techno music. Dragging your parents and their credits cards with you, while they are seated underneath a giant moose head and they suffer from stimulation overload, as you retreat to the fitting room to try on the very tightest and hottest pink polo you can find. Disclaimer: I worked for A&F and Hollister throughout college during the mid-00s, and I can recognize this scent immediately. Every now and then I‚Äôll pass a stranger on the street, and get a waft of Fierce. It‚Äôs unmistakable. And somehow not outdated. As always, it reeks of masculine collegiate sex. Any man wearing this will smell fresh, clean, youthful, and will make you do a double-take. Although I personally outgrew this scent years ago, I bought a bottle recently for old time‚Äôs sake. Occasionally I‚Äôll spritz it in my apartment or spray it on when I want to recapture my teenage self. One of my friends asked me in surprise, ‚ÄúAre you wearing‚Ä¶Fierce?,‚Äù and I replied ‚ÄúHell yes, I am.‚Äù ""It smells so good,‚Äù she laughed, as we both agreed that this scent has managed to stand the test of time and is still capable of activating hormones and testosterone.

It's that kind of cheap yet easy to just spray on and go fresh out the shower fragrance that every man likely has or had, something like Explorer by Mont Blanc or Cool Water, it's in that inoffensive, forgettable circle.  I have quite a few that fit that mould, but this one got put in the locker as I really HATE the bottle - when I ordered it they'd used the clear bottle in the listing. I don't really want topless blokes on my bottles being a straight guy, yet after reading about the CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch in the news, it's safe to say whose idea that was and I guess we can call ourselves lucky it wasn't much, much worse."", ""it smells like a men's gym locker room but women love it"", ""Still a beautiful scent in the most recent formulations.

This one holds a special place in my heart. I haven't bought a recent bottle but I remember it in the early 2000's. I think my last bottle was in 2007. I bought Mont Blanc Legend recently though and it reminded me of Fierce. Had good memories with Fierce."", ""I don't recall what note I loved in this frag but comparing with my other faves it could be the cardamom that melts down to oakmoss and musk.

You DO realize that Legend, which came out TEN years after Fierce WAS the copy of Fierce, right? I DO agree that the more reformulations this goes through, the less it resembles the original release. But I never give much credit to someone who\'s review consists of ""There\'s no WAY people ACTUALLY like this stuff as much as they SAY they do, I don\'t believe them!!"" I\'ll say this.. The only time I would go into Abercrombie stores at the mall back when they were at their peak, was at Christmas time. Usually to shop for the younger people on my list. And of course, they always sprayed the store with Fierce. My current bottle from 2015 still takes me right back to those busy Holiday evenings at the mall every time I wear it. So at least for me, it still definitely does the job.', ""I'm compelled to share my enthusiasm for this fragrance! Having tried both the clear and body-shaped bottles, I can attest that there's no discernible difference in scent. This fragrance has become my signature, with people often commenting that I don't smell like myself when I wear something else. I wholeheartedly recommend it, as it provides a full day of performance. Give it a try - I'm confident you'll love it!"", 'So I\'m going to be reviewing what Abercrombie labels ""The Vintage Edition"" on their website. This is the last formulation with the torso on the bottle that came out back in 2019, I believe. This is the one with the metal cap, not the black wooden cap. The old torso bottles had the black wooden cap. Now they have the clear bottles, which I cannot comment on because I haven\'t tried them. My batch is from 2019. To start, I have never smelled the older formulations, so I cannot comment on that also. However, I bet they were strong. Now, as for my 2019 Batch, the performance isn\'t bad to be honest. I get about 6hrs-7hrs of longevity and about 2hrs+ of decent Projection. If I\'m being honest, I really don\'t have a problem detecting the fragrance at all during those 6 to 7 hours. After that time period I have to bring my wrist to my nose to detect it, but even at that I can still smell a decent skin scent. The projection strength is average (it won\'t fill up a room) with the distance of it being arms length, which is fine for me. As for the scent, I love it. This is a classic scent that will always be nostalgic for many. This is the king of Mall Fragrances. When you think about the mall, there\'s no denying this Scent comes to mind. The scent is very nice and very appealing and will definitely not offend anyone. You can wear this to the office, when you\'re hanging out with friends, on casual days, or even use it as a signature Scent. This is definitely better than Mont Blanc Legend EDT in my opinion. Legend is frutier, whereas Fierce is citrusy. Either way this cologne is nice and definitely one of my favorites.', 'I‚Äôm not gunna bull shit and say this has amazing performance cuz it doesn‚Äôt. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as bad as some make out cuz I got two very nice compliments from people at work today and that was about 5 hours after I‚Äôd sprayed! I was very surprised others could smell it very easily as I didn‚Äôt hose myself down in it either, about 4 sprays. This may have been butchered by reformulations but it still smells amazing to my nose.', 'I love the idea from people who hate on this fragrance claim that it is generic with no backbone in being an influential scent. That cannot be further away from the truth. This is a fragrance that has proven to stand the test of time, released 20 years ago and still holding to this day. ""But only the younger crowd is wearing it"" as if that means there is no credibility in that.  it is also completely unfair that people think Abercrombie immediately means not worth the hype because it\'s not YSL or Dior or something... Judge a fragrance by the juice, not the brand. Fierce was once that TOP fragrance that every girl loved on their man, something that your favourite scent probably never did to a generation and I guarantee you it can be released to this day and perform well. You can still wear this today and pull compliments, I\'m sure of it. With regards to the reformulation comments, I can\'t really speak for it but I\'m always skeptical of reformulations drastically changing a scent. Why would a company just kill their line like that? Regardless, today\'s formulations still perform well and smell outstanding. My 2019 bottle served me well, too. This is still worthy to be in your collection. 8/10', ""This is an absolutely iconic frag, if you familiar with perfume world already ,you will recognize it immediately, and that's one of the most refreshing smells that I ever smelled.

This is a norm core, non-offensive, safe version of the true beast.  Still worth sniffing IMO."", 'Fantastic and long-lasting fragrance. It is suitable for all ages but it‚Äôs more of a younger scent, whatever that may mean. The spicy and citrus notes are prominent, which make is very appealing.

If it smells like Fierce, I've tried it) are just not it, and Percival, while good, is again...not Fierce. So...what to do?? Nothing. You are left to either enjoy it for what it is NOW, or forever sulk in what could and SHOULD have been.

I remember getting this on ebay and being delighted. You'd constantly get outbid for a bottle, even the small sizes would sell for over 100 quid.

Not sure about the performance, but the most I‚Äôve ever detected this scent on me is around 5 hours. Which is fine all things considered , it is an eau de cologne. Perhaps I will retry this in the heat of summer. Personally, for this type of DNA, I prefer the MontBlanc Legend EDP. It‚Äôs decently similar to this except more grown up, less sweet, and lasts longer IMHO. I would not re-purchase a full bottle of this, I believe better alternatives are avalaible in the market of today. TLDR: 7/10 for what it is.

Fire', 'This was a ""blind buy"" for me if you can even consider it that since I have smelled this numerous times while at the mall growing up. I remember walking by the A&F store as a little kid and absolutely loving the scent... I still absolutely love this stuff. My bottle is from 2016, and the longevity of the juice is quite good. I put two sprays on underneath my shirt before a work shift, and when I took my sweatshirt off toward the end of the shift (around 8 hours since spraying), my female colleague asked if I had just sprayed something. She said that it was subtle, but she really liked the scent. In fact, I got like 3 unsolicited compliments on this stuff within the first two days of wearing it, and I only use two sprays on myself! 10/10 I love this stuff. women dig it too. Smells like fresh out of the shower clean, masculine, slightly ""green"". Very effervescent, it feels like it sparkles of my skin.', 'I really blind bought this because of the good reviews. But they are probably a review of the older version. I paid way too much for this and I was not impressed at all. It smells like a deodorant that has been under your arm all day and are now stinking some sweat. It just dont feel the fresh clean smell the other rewievs are talking about.  It smells so intense that I get a headache if I wear it on my neck.', 'The ultimate showergel scent profile that is still used today for most men cosmetics.', 'I bought a brand new bottle. I believe its a 2021 or 2022 batch. It has the clear design, NO abs sticker, just a clear bottle. New cap that looks like metal, no woody cap. Performance is fine. I smell it for 3-4 hours and it lasts 8 hours on me. Smells like the reformulated fierce always smelled. I have a older bottle from 2015/2016 and there is literally no difference, except that the new one is stronger to my nose. Real vintage Fierce (pre 2010) is probably much stronger and better, but new Fierce is totally fine. Still a great fragrance!', 'What an amazing American masculine classic. PERFORMANCE IS FINE. I swear to the gods that 90% of people complaining about ""performance"" and ""reformulations"" are just going nose-blind. You see it in reviews for literally every single fragrance today; they have become meaningless buzzwords. I am wearing the modern formation and the performance/sillage is fantastic. And it smells as good as it ever has. That out of the way... Fierce is a classic for a reason. As Drakkar Noir defined the 80s, and Acqua di Gio defined the 90s, so does Fierce define the 2000s. It\'s aromatic and manly, youthful and vibrant but predates the bubblegum sweetness trend. It\'s fresh without smelling like body wash or body spray. I think Fierce works for men young or old, day or night, summer or winter. It\'s just one of those timeless and versatile fragrances. And it\'ll always have a spot on my shelf. Absolutely love this stuff and I doubt I\'ll ever tire of it.', 'Awesome, Masculine, Fresh smell. TERRIBLE performer. I sprayed 25 times and it was a skin scent an hour later. So dissapointing.', 'I was so looking forward to getting this fragrance after all these nice comments, but I gotta say I am so dissapointed. It does not smell good at all. It does not smell fresh. It smells old and musky. The bottle is completely new, but the scent is just not for me at all', ""Definitely one of my favorite scents from back in the day. I would wear this infrequently because I didn't want to run out. Nice spicy notes, very aromatic. This smells like college and I love it."", 'Everyone is complaining about this jot lasting, I dint understand. I wore this yesterday and was smelling it before I went to bed (easily over 12 hours) with 4 sprays. Even then it was kind of strong so I will probably only do 2. This is one if those fragrances you cannot quit snelling - you just want more. Its truly and addictive scent. The creators of this really found some magic in the formulation. Superb in 2023! PS: im not saying the top notes stay this long, but that salty musky base was going strong. For an EDC concentration, this thing performs incredibly well.', 'Nostalgic, fresh and sexy. It takes me back to a simpler more carefree time. I have many fragrances in my collection and some garner attention more than others, but this is one that people are probably gonna notice and ask about.', 'As of 2023, Fierce is not the same fragrance as it was. Contrary to what A&F claims on their own website, ""The same unmistakable fragrance"", it is not. Since the reformulation in 2017 it has not been the same. Now it has the longevity of about 10 seconds, and the projection is definitely the weakest of all the fragrances I\'ve ever used... You\'d be better of splashing water on your face. I can\'t overstate the difference between Fierce sold today and those before 2017. Its not the same fragrance at all.. Save your money.', 'I had this many years ago, it was a super popular fragrance up until the mid 2010‚Äôs. I got a bit turned off by it bc it felt so generic and people would just say ‚Äúyou smell like an a&f store‚Äù.  It‚Äôs been 10 years and I‚Äôve revisited it. The opening starts off a little bit more astringent than I remember it, but then it fades into the hot cloud of alluring freshness it used to be. I love it still, and I can appreciate it more now that it‚Äôs not as over used as if once was. I have a big bottle and enjoy it as a mixer, or just as an everyday basic fragrance.

Chanel Platinum Egoiste is a close second. Brilliant cologne for any age although not shocked to read it's not as potent."", 'I stopped wearing Fierce back in 2010 but I was feeling nostalgic recently. I was hearing a lot of conflicting reviews regarding the reformulation. Many were saying that Fierce is nothing like it was a decade ago, so I wanted to test it myself. I went ahead and picked up a bottle from the A&F website during their Christmas/New Year\'s sale. The bottle I bought didn\'t have the shirtless ab guy on it, and that was a welcome change. If there is any difference in the smell itself, I can\'t say it\'s noticeable. Still smells as good as I remember it. The dry-down is spectacular with a really fresh smelling woody-musk that has an addicting quality that makes me want to keep smelling more. It has a brightness about it that feels like summer, but not in a super ""green"" way. I know many people say that it\'s too generic, smells like a mall, is only for teenagers, etc. To me, the scent itself is simply fantastic and I think anyone can pull it off. I personally haven\'t smelled it on anyone since I stopped wearing it. My wife also LOVES the smell and that counts a lot for me. The criticisms about performance are warranted, but some are a bit exaggerated. I spray this on around 6:30 in the morning and I still smell it on my wrists around 1. I\'d say it has roughly 2-3 hours of decent projection and then hangs out closer to the skin for about another 3-4 hours. I was talking with someone on Sunday about 4 hours after putting it on and they asked me what I was wearing, so it at least hung around that long. I don\'t want the overbearing-in-your-face performance of the old formulations, but it could definitely be better. Overall, I give this one a ""like"". The scent is amazing and the versatility is excellent. If the performance was a little bit better I would give it a ""love"". As it stands, you\'ll need to re-apply in the afternoon if you want it to carry you through the entire day.', 'This is memories in a bottle. Plain and simple. Such an amazing scent at the time but I still love wearing it when feeling nostalgic.', 'This scent is completely mythic. a heady and iconic smell that communicated a whole set of values, beauty, racial hierarchies, jealousies, fears, sex urges, time, death, love.

I look at it like Cool Water. Brings back a lot of memories.  Personally, If I want this style of scent, then PDMs Percival is Fierce but more modern with better longevity and quality. You'll pay $100 more for Percival but if you have the funds it's worth it IMO.  My issue with this is that Fierce is at roughly $100 price point (that is what I am finding in the US at least). The quality vs. cost equation isn't worth it to me. Percival on the other hand smells much better, well crafted with great longevity.  You can grab Cool Water for nostalgia purposes at $30. At the $100 price point, you can get yourself so many great modern fragrances that last."", 'I bought recently a bottle of Fierce. The bottle is from 2019. I wanted to find out by myself several things around this fragrance. Especially how similar it is to my Percival and how good the projection and longevity is. Now some people may complain that I have an older batch, yet most started also complaining around 2015 that Fierce is just a shadow of itself, so I think my 2019 bottle is still ok to write about. While I really appreciate Percival in all aspects, I have to say that just comparing the pure smell and the fragrance itself for me Fierce is the better one. It is not easy to put in words, I would say Fierce is more smooth, not so harsh, it is more soft, it has something addicting, what makes you (and women) crave for more, wanting to be near that smell and want to smell it again and again. Don`t get me wrong: Percival is a great fragrance, I like to wear it especially for sports, it is more fresher, more aromatic than Fierce. It has more depth and is more grown up. It smells grown up and the ingredients are of high quality. While on the other hand Fierce has something rather cosy and sweet in it, if those words really fit to describe it. Do not expect complexity from this fragrance, but yeah I finally understand why this is a compliment magnet. Fierce and Percival do not make each other redundant.  Projection. Reading about it here I would have not even tried it. Glad I did. The first time I sprayed it on myself (5 sprays), my cousin ringed the door bell maybe 20 minutes later. He came in and told me that he could smell it outside in front of the closed apartment door and that it smells very simple but amazing and he would wear it. So much about that. The AF stores spray it probably on clothes and everywhere and it smells so strong, that one can smell it outside of the store. And we do have winter and cold weather here in Germany. So I can`t imagine this one not projecting in warmer climate. Longevity. In this moment while I am writing this, my sweatshirt from yesterday is on a chair maybe 1 meter from me and I still get whiffs of it, 12 hours after using Fierce. So yeah one has to spray it properly over clothes and oneself, lets say 5-6 sprays, and yeah maybe one has to reapply after several hours, but for me it is fine.  I see also people writing that Fierce is way overused, that maybe is the case in the USA. In Germany we never had that crazy Abercrombie&Fitch wave, so most people never used Fierce. Boss Bottled was the norm here. Today most guys do not even know about it, so it is a very rare scent and I am glad it is.', ""For the newer bottles - just a few different designs but same exact cologne. This is different and has been reformulated but honestly, I prefer the new formulations. Old formulation was explosive beast mode filling the whole mall. I think the smell is so close to the old formulation but does not last as long. Still I get at least 5 to 6 hours with this. But make no mistake - this is one of the best-smelling colognes ever made. Everyone loves this and while I normally never get complimented on colognes - this has on multiple different occasions. I wonder if that is the ISO super / Hediome molecules working their magic. For those older guys who feel this is more for the teenager and mid-twenties and won't try - you may want to try Parfums de Marly Percival. Smells so similar, clonish like but lasts way longer - easily 8 + hours. But that will cost you three times more."", 'Smells amazing but i believe it has been reformulated because it just doesnt last like it used to.

It is after all the iconic smell that pretty much in every fragrance store at mall in early 2000. It smells really good, don't get me wrong. And the fact that it is very mass appealing and lots of dupe are the reason that this DNA works well even for today. Also it is very versatile. Suitable for every ocassion, at any time all-year round. The only downside is the performance. Not the best sillage and not very long-lasting. It is rather expensive for that poor performance.

Can you {fill in question}....yep. This although is an og type fragrance and opened the door to a bunch of other fragrances. This will always have a place to remind people where the style started.

It's pleasant and crowd pleasing and I could see how it would rake in compliments especially with better longevity and projection, but still the scent is basic you could get better fresh appealing fragrances aswell so for me the smell was definitely underwhelming to say the least. Second the longevity and projection... when I first sprayed it I was already underwhelmed by the fragrance itself but when I sprayed the fragrance and it only lasted 30 minutes that was a deal breaker, you need to spray this like 10 times to get 5 hours üòÖüòÖ. Third thing is price... Price is relatively decent but still expensive for what you get (80$ for a 3.4oz listed on their website), when my bottle runs out I will not be getting another bottle to say the least. Overall I give it a 2.5 out of 10 it serves its purpose as a gym bag or after shower fragrance nothing else, i really tried to like it but its boringness and lack of preformance leave it with my complete dissatisfaction... you could get nautica voyage or Tommy Bahama very cool and even Tommy hillfiger which smell better, last longer and are half the price with more bang for your buck."", 'I just bought a new bottle from Abercrombie.com and even though the smell itself is not as good as it used to be, back in the early 2000‚Äôs, it‚Äôs still good. It‚Äôs the performance that sucks. I applied 7 sprays last night and literally got 2.5 hours of longevity. Only projected good for about an hour as well.  So disappointing too cause it‚Äôs such a classic scent. I remember my first bottle I bought back in the early 2000‚Äôs‚Ä¶..2-3 sprays and it lasted like 7-8 hours.  I was able to find a sealed in the box silver cap Fierce on eBay. The seller clearly didn‚Äôt know what he had cause I paid $75 for it. Unfortunately the longevity is only a few hours as well, probably because it‚Äôs so old. The top notes have degraded as well.

Women of all ages love this cologne - it is an amazing compliment getter. It projects well for first few hours and has a very pleasant freshness to it. The mid and dry down leave a wonderful scent trail that again it grabs attention in a great way. I am totally shocked to be honest. Lasts maybe 5 hours on my skin but good enough. I was told PDM Percival was a niche version of fierce and I can kind of agree but Percival gave me a headache when oversprayed (more beast mode projection). I will stick with the original fierce.

Whether you want to admit it or not, fierce is probably the top 3 best fragrances ever created. Even after countless reformulations it‚Äôs still being worn today. Just shows how much back bone this cologne has.  Say what you will about ‚Äúyouth‚Äù fragrances, once the day comes when I‚Äôm as old as Joe Biden I‚Äôll be wearing this cologne on my boat explaining to the girls that swam 14 miles from shore what fragrance I have on.', 'I understand that people are influenced by trends, image and marketing. People are loyal to, or avoid brands for the wrong reasons. Branding helps sell products, and attempts to create a favorable image for the buyer. While I don\'t prefer pictures of shirtless men on my stuff, that\'s about the only negative aspect to Abercrombie\'s ""Fierce"" cologne. That\'s it. Just some dumb torso on a bottle (and the sticker can be removed). If you can\'t get past that;or all your other ideas about what Abercrombie is or isn\'t, you\'re missing out on an incredible fragrance. It took me years to figure out what it was. During my mid 20\'s, I didn\'t really care about fragrances. I definitely like them, but didn\'t pay much attention or bother wearing them. ""Fierce"" was the only scent that I really noticed. I\'d be out and about, and catch this scent in the air all of a sudden. It would immediately grab my attention. This went on for years, because I couldn\'t approach the random ""Fierce"" wearer and say ""Hey man, what are you wearing?"". Finally I figured it out. I bought a very nice used sweater on Ebay. When it arrived, it had been sprayed with this stuff. So I took the sweater and had people smell it to identify what this scent was. The closest suggestion was a girl who said ""Uh, I think that\'s Abercrombie, but I\'m not sure."". So I had to go to an Abercrombie store to check it out. I\'ll admit this was my first time in there. I didn\'t waste time. I sprayed the paper and ran out. At first I thought this girl was wrong, but after about a 5 minute dry-down the woods came out and I had finally figured it out! Anyway, this scent goes beyond teenagers, it goes beyond ""frat boys"" and even beyond what Abercrombie would like you to believe their image is. This is simply an excellent fragrance. I believe this citrus/woods combo is the best out there. The dry-down of ""Fierce"" is my favorite in my collection. It is definitely masculine; that of a refined, adventurous type guy. Nothing about this says 15 year old punk. NOTHING. Nothing about the vibe it captures says ""What\'s up bro?"". In fact, most of the people that I encounter love the scent, and are completely unfamiliar with it or where it comes from. They know nothing beyond the fact that it smells absolutely wonderful... You can associate fragrances with whatever you want, but if the ""Abercrombie"" name and the little shirtless guy on the bottle is scaring you away, that\'s really too bad. (for you)', 'For teenage boys and those who came of age in the 2000s, this scent is the GOAT. My scent preferences have skewed to the more niche, high-end and considerably more expensive in recent years, but there‚Äôs still nothing like a bottle of Fierce. The 2000s will never die, so long as this scent lives on. Just one gentle whiff of this (not that there is anything remotely gentle about this fragrance, as you can smell it a mile away ‚Äì and I mean that in the best possible way), and you‚Äôre instantly transported back to Abercrombie & Fitch in a 2000s era mall. Some say this has been reformulated to blandness but, no, it‚Äôs still all here. Pure nostalgia. Black and white images of shirtless toned men, and pumping techno music. Dragging your parents and their credits cards with you, while they are seated underneath a giant moose head and they suffer from stimulation overload, as you retreat to the fitting room to try on the very tightest and hottest pink polo you can find. Disclaimer: I worked for A&F and Hollister throughout college during the mid-00s, and I can recognize this scent immediately. Every now and then I‚Äôll pass a stranger on the street, and get a waft of Fierce. It‚Äôs unmistakable. And somehow not outdated. As always, it reeks of masculine collegiate sex. Any man wearing this will smell fresh, clean, youthful, and will make you do a double-take. Although I personally outgrew this scent years ago, I bought a bottle recently for old time‚Äôs sake. Occasionally I‚Äôll spritz it in my apartment or spray it on when I want to recapture my teenage self. One of my friends asked me in surprise, ‚ÄúAre you wearing‚Ä¶Fierce?,‚Äù and I replied ‚ÄúHell yes, I am.‚Äù ""It smells so good,‚Äù she laughed, as we both agreed that this scent has managed to stand the test of time and is still capable of activating hormones and testosterone. In five words or less: 2005 in a bottle. Priceless.', 'If you want Fierce, just buy Fierce. Don‚Äôt buy Legend or Percival. Definitely don‚Äôt buy Dua‚Äôs #Fierce. I‚Äôve bought a few bottles of #Fierce and every time it smells like bad body odor. I sold both my bottles. Even at $38.50 with the 30% discount, it‚Äôs not a good deal at all for a 30ml clone. It‚Äôs a rip off. That stuff is an oily mess. Stick with A&F Fierce. The new formulation is not as bad as everyone says. Half of you people don‚Äôt even remember what it smelled like in the early 2000‚Äôs. This lasts around 6-7 hours. That‚Äôs plenty for me and it smells great.', ""It's 2004 and your mom is dragging you through JCPenny's and Macy's. To keep you quiet she got you Wetzel's Pretzels' cinnamon bites and a Coke. Your fingers are sticky, you're sitting on the worn leather bench with the mirror on the bottom in the shoe section while she's making you try on shoes but you're too busy challenging the Elite Four on your Nintendo DS. The only worry in your life is who you should use your Masterball on, and that school is starting again soon.  That's what this scent is, in a bottle. And it's magical."", 'I\'ve always thought A&F to be a poorman\'s Calvin Klein. The ads are what first gave me that impression. Hmm, slightly dull metallic filters of half naked youths usually provocatively posed in black and white snapshots with minimalistic backgrounds...dang, where have I seen THAT before!? The clothing is mediocre, I mean really REALLY look at it...strip it of its label and it can easily pass for something you\'d find at Old Navy (and for a better price). So when it came to hearing about their ""new and exciting male perfume"", I wasn\'t exactly running to camp outside the mall doors to get a first whiff of it.  Let me state that although I may sound rigid in opinion, I know how to be objective. I kept an open mind and decided to sample it since by chance, I was sent a trial size in the mail (entirely unrequested btw). Since it HAS happened before that I get surprised and even humbled with fragrances by designers I don\'t care much for (i.e. Donna Karan and Thierry Mugler), I gave A&F\'s Fierce the same opportunity to impress. My impression: This is like the newblood in the locker room with some older fragrances. I can smell where it has a little of this fragrance and that one but Fierce has that typical air of youthful inexperience which it masks with its overconfident sillage. It reminded me a little of Egoiste Platinum without its refinement, Dolce & Gabbana pour Homme but without body hair (or testosterone for that matter), I mean, Fierce smelled pretty good but it didn\'t make me think of unique, much less drool worthy sexy at all other than the well defined torso on the bottle like Arabian Night and a few other reviewers have said.  This is the same sort of marketing 101 that many fall for, ""Put something naked on it and people will wanna buy it"", sex sells as they say. Its why you see ads with some scantily clad woman smiling like she is OH SO totally turned ON and excited to be posed sitting on top of a TIRE. It is also a general rule of thumb that if you have to get a naked person to sell your product, its more than likely a cheap product.When was the last time a naked chick needed to be used to sell a Rolls Royce? Go ahead, I\'ll wait.  In all, Fierce was not something special to me, it wasn\'t unique, it didn\'t incite, inspire nor intrigue. It IS pleasant, but not something that I will place on the mantle of great male fragrances or seducers nor will it knock perfumes such as Drakkar off of its (then) trendy but freakishly sexy legendary perch. So scratch me off the list of the hordes of females that go nuts for Fierce. I\'m too spoiled by the past greats to be impressed by this.', ""I felt like I needed to review this based on how unhappy I am with the recent formulation. I bought this from the Abercrombie store around April 2016.  This is not the same juice as it was mid 2000s. I remember the vintage fierce lasting 10 hours+ -- it would last from early morning 7am until 10pm, only after showering would the scent go away. This new juice is so watered down it's no longer worth the purchase. There are much cheaper alternatives (I paid ~$80 USD for 50ml bottle) with much better performance. I get 30min-1hour of okay projection and then it becomes a skin scent. I'm not even kidding, sprayed it at 9pm tonight and its a skin scent at 10:30pm. Asked someone if they could smell my cologne and she could only smell it when she dug her nose into my arm. I really wanted to like this because I remember how much of a compliment monster it used to be. Also, no one in my country uses Abercrombie so I figured it would be unique. Save yourself the money and pass on this one.  The scent is nice, but what's the point if it only lasts about an hour and no one can smell it. Huge disappointment and wishing I just purchased another bottle of Legend Mont Blanc instead of this garbage. It's really sad seeing a once great fragrance turn to crap after reformulations. What's even more surprising is this is probably one of the few products keeping Abercrombie's business alive -- why ruin your best product. RIP Abercrombie Fierce 2002-2016"", ""Bought this scent last year, because my girlfriend loved the scent from back in the day...memory lane type of thing.

A joyful alternation of harmonious clear and sunny, citrus, woody and musky notes. In the Himalaya fragrance, the Mediterranean grit of citrus nuances energizes which magically blend with warmer and spicier tones of vetiver, oriental sandalwood and lively pepper. The precious ambergris reigns supreme over the entire temporal olfactory experience and the Tonkino musk adds sensual and opulent depth. A dynamic, kaleidoscopic fragrance that is ""quicksilver on you"" just like the regal packaging that characterizes it. Maison Creed hardly misses a beat and Himalaya is a clear confirmation of this.', 'Frutiger aero and Y2K core if it had a smell', 'If Silver Mountain Water and Green Irish Tweed had a baby, this is what it would be. Himalaya is a really nice and fresh fragrance. The citrus opening is present, but it has an airy quality to it, along with a musky and creamy sandalwood in the back. The scent as a whole gives me barbershoppy vibes as the barbershops I used to go to pre-pandemic used to smell similar to this from what I remember. Once it dries down, the sandalwood comes forward, but the citruses remain, although much less prominent. Dried down, Himalaya has this sharp, almost aldehydic smell to it, which gives off the ""icy"" feel of the fragrance. As much as I like Himalaya, I don\'t find it to be a good performing fragrance. I\'m unsure if my sample is old, if I go nose blind to these types of fragrances really quickly, if Himalaya simply doesn\'t perform well or maybe all of the above, but I don\'t get much projection from this fragrance at all. It seems to project decently right after spraying, but after about 30 minutes or so I have a hard time catching whiffs of it when I move, only smelling it when I smell my arm up close. I think Kilian\'s Vodka on the Rocks is a pretty similar fragrance to Himalaya, but even though I consider that to also not perform too well, it projects more and I can smell it for longer than Himalaya. It\'s been almost four hours since I applied it on myself and it\'s pretty much become a skin scent. I\'ll probably get a larger decant in the near future but as it stands I would not consider buying a full sized bottle, even at discounter prices. However, I might consider it if I see better performance with a larger decant.', 'mid', ""Pretty basic smelling freshie.

The dna isn't uncommon either as there's quite a few designers that falls under the same category.

So clean, so simple, nothing quite like it - but not a mind-blower. Does need a re-apply around lunchtime.', 'Today I\'m moving onto a Creed fragrance I\'m fairly intrigued to try; Himalaya. Just the name itself evokes images of icy mountains and fresh air. I\'m not sure how much of that is going to translate into how the fragrance smells, but I\'m excited to see. This is another Creed fragrance that doesn\'t get talked about as much as the others, but it\'s not as obscure as say Royal Water that I reviewed a couple of days ago. Without futher adieu, let\'s get into it; Scent: The opening is citrusy, spicy, and woody. The primary notes I get are Calabrian bergamot, grapefruit, Sicilian lemon, and sandalwood. The strongest of the notes are the Calabrian bergamot and sandalwood. The Calabrian bergamot opens with a burst of fresh citrus. It\'s not lemon-y like most bergamot notes I encounter; instead it lands somewhere between a lime and an orange. Bitter and tart like a lime, but juicy and sweet like an orange. Right behind that citrus is the signature peppery spiciness that tickles the nose just a bit. This bergamot note also forgoes its typical aromatic qualities in exchange for a soft, subtle floral nuance. Sharing the spotlight with the Calabrian bergamot is the sandalwood. Nothing out of the ordinary here; bold and woody with distinct powdery tones. Up next is the grapefruit and Sicilian lemon. The grapefruit offers more citrus but with a signature bitterness, separate from that of the Calabrian bergamot. Lastly, the Sicilian lemon doubles down with more citrus, but this time focused on lemon (obviously) and a  noticeable rindiness. The dry down is musky, woody, and earthy. The primary notes I get are musk, sandalwood, bergamot, and ambergris. The strongest of the notes are the musk and sandalwood. The musk has emerged in the dry down to be a primary note. It\'s fresh, clean, and airy with just a bit of fuzziness. The sandalwood has continued into the dry down with the same woody and powdery tones from the opening at the same intensity; not any weaker or stronger. This is followed by the ambergris and bergamot. The bergamot still has the same citrusy and spicy accord from the opening, just toned down and more mellow. Lastly, the ambergris is noticeable in the background as a pronounced earthiness nuanced with a bit of warmth. In fact, the earthiness was so palpable that I initially thought it was a patchouli note that I had overlooked; but nope, just ambergris. It\'s worth mentioning that I also get a distinct ""icy"" accord here. I\'m not sure why or how, and maybe it\'s just me associating from the name of the fragrance, but I get ""cold"" vibes from Himalaya. Performance: Initial projection within the first hour is strong at around 6 feet. Sillage matches that strength with an easily noticeable scent trail. After a few hours the performance was unchanged. At the 7 hour mark the projection was about 3 feet and the scent trail was still noticeable. The fragrance lasted about 9-10 hours before becoming a skin scent. When to wear: Himalaya shines best as a daytime spring/summer fragrance. The brightness of the citrus notes in the opening and the fresh musk in the dry down lend themselves well to warmer weather. As for occasion, this fragrance will feel appropriate for pretty much anything you can think of. Casual, formal, even office wear; Himalaya will match the tone. Blind buy: If you like fresh and woody fragrances Himalaya is a pretty safe blind buy. Strangely enough, I can understand the comparisons to Zoologist Penguin, particularly in the dry down; so if you\'ve ever experienced that and enjoyed it, you\'ll probably enjoy Himalaya as well. It\'s like Penguin made mass-appealing. Final verdict: Himalaya was quite the experience. There was more of a transition between opening and dry down than I thought there would be, but it was very interesting and enjoyable. It definitely does evoke the impression of being in the mountains with that mysterious ""icy"" tone. Performance is solid for such a fresh scent. Strong projection and scent trails for the first few hours, and lasting around 9-10 before becoming a skin scent. When it comes to versatility, I would consider Himalaya average. It will work for essentially any occasions you can think of, but only in warmer weather. Mass-appeal is high for Himalaya; most people will agree it smells great and there aren\'t any weird or challenging notes in the composition that would throw someone off. To wrap this up; I thought Himalaya was going to be something special when I first smelled it, and I thought right. Between the fresh mountain air feeling I get from it, and the respectable performance it comes with, Himalaya is worth the money. I will be getting a bottle of this when I can. Scent: 10/10 Longevity: 8/10 Sillage: 8/10', 'The channel that flows within Creed Himalaya evokes an oriental subtly that is not common and seeks not to attract nor grab at one‚Äôs attention; it speaks to an assent to attain wisdom, which shares some elements that are universal yet still singularly unique and thereby discovered, beloved, praised, recognized, and adored. Good luck to all who aspire. In my opinion it is the ambergris that is the determining factor as to whether you, the wearer, will see it a success.

I'm currently on my 4th bottle of it ever since I got back into fragrances about 3 years ago. I know one day I won't be able to get a vintage batch, so I decided to try a recent F batch. What Creed has done to Himalaya is an absolute travesty. The F batch Himalaya is a shell of it's former self.  The vintage batch goes through 3-4 different phases and the bold calming and warming sandalwood base in the dry down and the sourness from the ambergris in the far dry down which could be considered the 4th stage is completely gone in the F batch and all we're left with is a faded perfumy smell. =(. I enjoy wearing vintage Himalaya to bed in the colder months because the sandalwood in the dry down makes you feel so cozy while under the blanket. Now it's all gone in the F batch.  Performance on the new F batch is poor as well. It doesn't take long, maybe after an hour or so for it to enter the faded perfumy smell phase. The vintage batch lasts all day while giving you a good amount of time to experience each phase. All the people here who love Himalaya right now based on the current formulation, I wonder how much you'd like Himalaya if you could experience a vintage batch.  I wear Himalaya all throughout the year, and this isn't just a cold weather scent. It works great in the summer, too.

Bold and deep freshness, but somehow has a lightness too; reminds me of glacial water in a small pool formed from the erosion of hard, pale, mountainous rock. This fragrance is like the cold, crisp air of a foggy winter morning mixed with thin ice and dew on grass in a bottle. The fresh citrus allows it to be used in the summer too, thus making it a well-rounded scent. While I like to think that most fragrances can be used at any time of day in (very) specific situations, I don't see myself using Himalaya at night because of the aforementioned morning association. I usually don't like opaque bottles, but the all-silver casing is very apt. This is meant to be a personal record, not a review."", 'Another reformulated one?. This is nothing but lemon , juniper and a sandalwood bomb. Old spice type scent. Smelling this, Antonio Puig -Quorum comes to mind. The smell is dated also now. Creed spice and wood, Original Santal and all Aventus versions are miles better. No thanks to this dud.', 'Oke, my first Creed review. First of all, I have a fondness for the brands fragrances. I like the sort of understated luxury, class and simplicity in the compositions. Their prices are too high considering what you get compared to other perfume houses/makers. However if you are someone of a certain income/status these prices aren\'t really a barrier or concern. I believe Creed as a brand knows this and wont change price/quality because their stuff isn\'t made for fragrance enthousiast, rather its to cater to people with a lot of disposable income. So to the smell... Starts with bright citrus opening which is almost immediately contrasted with a sort of creamy undertone. This gives the sensation of snow. Bright/icy yet crumbles and becomes fluid and soft. This is the first unique thing about it. After about 40minutes there is this slight gunpowder note its soft and understated. Like a metallic lightly smokey accord. It gives the sandalwood textural grit. This reminds me of the flint note in Terre de Hermes. Its there and yet it isn\'t cutting through. it gives a certain mystery.  Without it it would be a simple citrus-musk-sandalwood fragrance. This also brings a sort of salty quality to my nose (which I enjoy) Lavender and woods lend the barbershop edge to it, yet it doesn\'t scream fougere. It stays pretty linear after this, dry down to musky sandalwood.  Its creamy on the skin, its comforting.  Again it has the feeling of luxury and class without being overpowered or to ""perfume-like"" I enjoy this once in a while when i want a soft sandalwood scent.  This isn\'t going to blow your mind, however I don\'t think this brand is about making innovative and challenging compositions.  For enthousiast i recommend finding a clone.', 'This one I have struggled with for a while. To me it‚Äôs a bit of a chameleon. Sometimes it smells like a very dated 80s typical men‚Äôs designer fragrance. Other times it smells like a bar of soap. Next it smells very screechy in the opening and dense at the base. To sum up, it‚Äôs a down the middle freshie for men with a slightly dated feel. Jack of all trades and master of none. It‚Äôs not really a gym or work scent, more like a dumb reach scent for the weekends.  It‚Äôs not going to impress anyone, not even yourself. I own a full bottle, but really struggle to justify buying it ever again. For the asking price of 200 to 300 dollars you can literally buy any niche, designer or indie fragrance you desire. Options are limitless here from Amouage to Malle to MFK to Prada, Dior, you name it.', ""I absolutely love Creed Himalaya. It is very refreshing like a burst of cold fresh dewy air in the mountains at dawn. Then it dries down to a clean creamy aftershave barber shop or freshly groomed gentlemen. I get 1 hour moderate projection and silage and then 3 hours as a skin scent. So this is more suited to run a few errands or go to the gym. Unless you don't mind re spraying and can afford to do so as Creed's are not cheap. It definitely can be a year round scent and signature worthy in my opinion. It does puts me in a great mood while wearing it and I do love displaying the cool silver metallic bottle."", ""The third in the trio of very similar (and IMO worst) perfumes from Creed.  Fresh air, intense saline facets and bergamot pith. Something very green, very bitter in here as well. Like mountain air indeed, but with a big dash of headache.  Definitely something for the one who's looking to get away from designer fragrances and intro niche but just barely."", ""I read and watched lot of reviews on Creed Himalaya, everyone gives lest priority to this gem. So, I too stopped exploring this, but during my search of Bois du Portugal 120 ml bottle, I ended up getting 2018 batch Creed Himalaya.  I was not interested to get it initially; shop person told me to try sample of it for few days and then decide.  I gave 1 test waring and 1 complete waring of it, and I immediately liked it so much, as I got it for good, discounted price I grabbed without any hesitation.  Manly, somehow your typical freshie scent but for a trained nose it is a bit more than that. Very refined & well put together and I cannot see you go wrong with this one. It gives some vibes of icy fresh indeed and it also has a metallic feel to it which I love (maybe that gunpowder shoots at times lol). I got this for a great deal but being a creed, it won't be cheap. If you do like fresh & metallic frags, chances are high for you to enjoy this one. An underrated fragrance. An enjoyable citrusy opening with a sexy musky, Sandalwood and Woody drydown. Surprisingly I have received the most compliments on this one as well.

It begins with a gust of citrus, as if the sun has just risen over distant mountains, scattering light and clarity into the atmosphere. Beneath that freshness lies the strength of sandalwood and musk, like the solid earth beneath your feet steady, grounding, timeless. Yet, while this Creed is captivating, it does not last long and fades away quickly, like a mist that dissipates too soon. Still, in its fleeting presence, it‚Äôs the scent of adventure captured, where the spirit of the mountains breathes through every note.', ""Man this stuff is terrible. I walked around the office and sprayed 5 ppl...this is the feedback 1. This smells like a Ross Dept store 2. This smells very screechy 3. This smells like a cheap chevy cobalt that's full of cheap plastic 4. This smells like very loud static, this is the scent of static  5. What is this supposed to be? This doesn't smell like a fragrance Honestly... this is something a guy that's like 50+ and doesn't want to smell like citruses or anything aquatic. Just a hard oldschool, medicinal, herbal type of freshness for a senior citizen or something"", 'Sparkling lemon and ambergris. First of all, I love the way that this behaves on my skin. It floats around like a beautiful cloud of wealth and cleanliness. The lemon in the opening is fizzy and immediately supported by a creamy sandalwood. All of this is followed up by a beautiful cloud of ambergris that makes me feel like a million bucks. This is one of those scents that just does it for me. If I wore this the way I want to wear it, my 50ml would be gone in no time. This does give me ‚Äúonly‚Äù 5-6 hours of longevity, if you care. If you are a ‚Äúbeast mode‚Äù performance junkie, then by all means, skip this one. While you pound the nasal passages surrounding you with 10 sprays of some PDM, I‚Äôll grace my acquaintances with wafts of Creed‚Äôs beautiful ‚ÄúHimalaya‚Äù. This is a 10 out of 10 for me.', 'Probably the best Creed', 'I\'ve got a 500ml flacon from early 2018 with about 175ml remaining - the longevity as a skin scent and the projection for the first few hours is actually fantastic on this one, much more so than actually any other Creed I\'ve smelled. Despite the citrus notes this may be one that benefits a lot from having some age on it. I absolutely love the smell, it\'s definitely reminiscent of an older fashioned ""gentlemanly"" sort of scent, but that gunpowder smokiness really does come through and the quality of the other notes is very apparent. Probably my favorite from Creed so far.', ""Smells like an grandpa soap to me. I'd rater go silver mountain water for similar vibes.  To me best creeds are royal oud and original santal."", 'I know it is designed for men, but I am a sucker for a good mens fragrance. Himalaya is a fresh, clean blast of lemon at first spray love. It gave me that just stepped out of the shower, slip into a breezy muted linen summer shift and stepping out into the backyard sunshine feeling.  For Men pull on your linen button down, slip on your comfy slacks and slide into your grey leather yacht loafers . It became a very close to the skin scent in the first w hours and gone by hours 4/5 which is not bad for a citrus scent but surprising for a Creed.', 'Nothing too great, but clean scent. Smells like a man fresh out of the shower', ""Decent longevity, inoffensive, fresh. Reminds me of D&G Light Blue Intense minus the juniper. Citrus, wood, and a little soapy instead. For Creed pricing you'd expect something unique and masteful but instead it's a perfectly serviceable Summer freshie."", 'Smells like someone tried covering up their pit stink with lemon pledge. 100% try it for yourself though.', ""A masterpiece. Cool, refreshing scent that's perfect for all occasions. Part of my trilogy of Cool Creeds, along with Silver Mountain Water and Millesime Imperial that have that cold and fresh scent. Difficult not to like. Performance is low, but if you refresh midday, you should be good. Try it at a high end store, or the Creed Boutique. I haven't smelled it on anyone I've come across yet. A great lowkey Creed!"", ""Costco was blowing this out for about $146 for 100 ML; it's an F batch with the new metal cap that's a huge upgrade. I've had my eye on it for a while, and that price. this is insanely good. I had tried it multiple times in stores and always passed. Discount prices around $200+ always had me wanting something else instead. This was the moment! This one of the best smelling office/professional fragrances I've come across. Does it dress down, too? Yes--I wore it with gym shorts and a T-shirt earlier, but this feels like wearing a nice Italian shirt, suede shoes, and expensive pants. This is a CEO-type of fragrance! Maybe I'm bought too much into the marketing, but it definitely has an icy, mountain feel to it. Because of that edge, I think it's suitable to wear in the cold, and the freshness of it makes it perfect for Summer, too. It's a Swiss army knife fragrance! The longevity leaves a little to be desired (around 5 hours max before becoming a skin scent), but I feel confident that the performance is going to improve when the bottle has macerated a few months. What is it most similar to? It's got some similarities to Millesime Imperial (which I think it's closest to), maybe a touch of green like Green Irish Tweed, and some slight influence from Silver Mountain Water. If you like any of those, this will likely be a winner for you. This immediately became a favorite for me that I plan to use a lot.

Tried it again recently and imagine a fluorescent white exclamation point popping above my head. It just smells great‚Ä¶masculine, clean, a little mature. I think I do pick up the gunpowder.

I don't find this suitable for hot summer days because of the musky depth that this has, but that depth gives it a sexy alluring edge while remaining a fresh fragrance which is awesome and unique to the other fresh offerings from Creed. I think this is best suited for sub-80-degree weather or summer nights. This also has solid performance which is great."", ""Love this stuff!

They are able to capture an image and incapsulate a smell. Dry down is this and a light white musk and a salty wind or airy type smell. I love it.

There‚Äôs a couple reviews below that state it reminds them of Gillette shaving cream/aftershave, or a shower gel. And I honestly can understand where they‚Äôre coming from, as that‚Äôs the vibe it gives off. That classic barbershop/fougere clean vibe.  To me this scent is very clean and refreshing. It‚Äôs not anything groundbreaking or original. It‚Äôs casual while being upper class.  I have about 12 Creeds now and springing for a full bottle may be a bit redundant for my line up.  But if I were to get it I‚Äôd be wearing it when I just want to feel refreshed and don‚Äôt want to be in a specific vibe ‚Äî after a shower and I‚Äôll be around the house, going for a walk, going to work.  I currently have Royal Water that could fill all those roles with more class, which works for Spring/Summer. But I could see Himalaya filling in for the fall/winter months. To cap it off, it‚Äôs a great performer, smells fantastic, is not polarizing, smells fresh and clean. In the end you smell put together and fresh, with a shower like gel/aftershave vibe.  Maybe I‚Äôll buy a bottle if I feel like I‚Äôm that bougie for after my showers on a weekday. I do love buying Creeds.. UPDATE *Creed boutique gave me 10ml free with a recent purchase I made in-person.  I‚Äôve since been using this here and there in rotation with all my summer/spring fragrances.

I just received an F batch with the metal cap and the opening literally had me standing in awe for a minute at how lovely it smells. Icy, fresh, grassy and slightly soapy is how I would describe it in the simplest terms. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre standing in a meadow on a snowy mountainside while taking a break during a morning hike. I have nothing else like this and I am super happy to add it to my collection. Classy and super refined, Himalaya has a similar mass appealing yet unique vibe that Silver Mountain Water has, both are just gorgeous, and I feel they make wonderful companions for one another. Neither one is redundant to the other and you can easily dress them up or down just as well. Nobody else does classy and gentlemanly freshness quite like Creed, and this one is a stellar example!', ""@Jon St  You most likely need to give it time. I read an interesting review on this site the other day from someone who went on to explain how to wear perfumes. I thought at first this guy was a little too over the top, but what he said started to sink in and make sense. Then I read a little about the process of perfume maceration, and was surprised at how long it could take; months, and I would say at least 5-6 months if you want to arrive at superb performance. Now, this isn't to say that you shouldn't wear your perfume for this lengthy time, but rather that it may take that amount of time before the performance hits it's peak.

I feel like I will really need to see how it performs in hot weather, but that won't be for several more months (as I write this it's late December in Wisconsin). Between my skin that absorbs fragrances and the colder weather currently, I don't think I'll use this much over the winter - but I am going to Mexico in April and will plan to this along and see how it does there."", 'I get the GIT comparison.

If anything, I‚Äôd say GIT is a bit ‚Äúcolder‚Äù which is what I think of when I think barbershop - this is almost warm and sweet.

It‚Äôs safe, it‚Äôs nice, it‚Äôs clean. It doesn‚Äôt blow me away.  I wouldn‚Äôt call this a ‚Äòblue‚Äô scent, but to me it smells a bit shower gel-like in the opening. Like a lemon shower gel. If this were half the price it would be a no brainer. At this price though, it‚Äôs a bit too safe imo.

The far dry down ( & I mean far ) is tolerable as a musky, salty skin scent when the sandalwood, citrus & ambergris actually start to tone down & work together. It is a bit dated smelling, but not too much.', 'Aouuuuuuu Weeeee!!! I LOVE this one right here. I go through about a bottle per year. I probly wear it too heavy , but‚Ä¶. Ask me if I give AF ‚úÖ bet you‚Äôll come to understand that I certainly do Not!! I discovered this couple years ago,.. bout to order my 3rd bottle. PR XS came first, ; ) just like the rooster üëä üòâ I have them both and I enjoy the creed 10x more. It is Sooooo much smother around the edges !! 11/10 for me', ""I seen this on Facebook Marketplace super cheap and I couldn't help check here and see what is said about this. It's crazy cause when you hear or see anything about Creed, it's 99% the combination of Aventus, GIT, Silver Mountain Water and MI. I know there are plenty more great ones cause I've smelled them. I just refuse to pay such a high price for a fragrance.  From the notes this looks very interesting and you see quite a few people have something to say. I'm really on the fence but the price is cheap.  I think it's sad they sold Creed to someone else cause I'm going thru Creed's catalog of fragrances and the perfumer is always a Creed, even more than one perfumer of utting their heads together. It was one of those things they advertised that gave you this father to son vibe and here they go and just destroy everything their elders created. I mean love ot hate them, they have successfully pulled off a great one selling a $5 fragrance for $500. They are doing something right plus I know there was that thing where certain reviewers were getting juiced to boost the Creed in their top 10 lists and it was some scandal or whatever. But just think, there won't be anymore Creeds doing perfumery for Creed. For a company it's a wise choice, cause the name and Aventus alone will pay off their investments. All's they got to do is sit back and fill orders. Maybe juice a reviewer or just the vibe is still there. The energy you see in Aventus is still strong and people really sit there and compare batches like they really deviate from the exact same formula. Depending on how noseblind they are at the moment, one person may be blind to the citrus so they will swear this batch is more smokey, or someone is noseblind to woody stuff so they argue this batch has more pineapple. When it's all in their heads.  I think I'm gonna try this one just so I have a Creed fragrance, that isn't so ubiquitous. Like these clone nowadays are almost art how good they duplicate a scent. It's good I think cause people do set the prices. If someone can make the same exact thing for 1/15th the price, sorry but it's no longer frowned upon to have clones. This one here seems unique and I got a good general idea what it kind of smells like and for less than $100 I'm gonna try it out. If anything huge I'll edit and say what I think. Hope everyone is good!"", 'I\'ve enjoyed wearing this for a while now but recently I was working in central London for a few days and packed it as I knew there would be a couple of nights out drinking/dining. So, two sprays only and I headed out to the Docklands (drinks at The Oiler Bar and dinner at Nakhon Thai, both places excellent). For some reason, on my skin at least, this really cooks in warm weather - it comes alive and it\'s the Sandalwood that really stands out. In less warmer weather I get a smooth, creamy affair but in the warmth of the evening, the Sandalwood, smooth but almost fiery in nature becomes the burning star, possibly aided by the ""Gunpowder"" note mentioned on the Creed website. I don\'t see this as a date night fragrance, it isn\'t romantic but then I don\'t believe that was the intention. This would work well in a suited formal or black tie setting. I can add nothing further that hasn\'t already been said.', 'My perhaps somewhat boring and old fashioned dumb-grab, but I do find it underrated. Especially as it is very long projecting on my skin, well beyond 24 hours! (Only ‚ÄùBois de Portugal‚Äù stayed longer, but that one was too heavy for me.) Can something smell both soapy clean and musky at the same time..? Yes, and this is the proof. Initial grapefruit quickly gives way to smooth sandalwood and the depth of ambergris. On the right skin, at least, otherwise it may well just smell like shortlived barbershop, I guess. A very European scent, but I guess Himalaya sounds more cool than Mont Blanc..? Also strongly leaning towards the middle-aged men segment rather than young adventurous mountaineers, but being an overweight 50 yo, I don‚Äôt care. Also a frag for the colder seasons.', 'Smells dated. This would go well with a 40 yr and up man. Mature. Lemony woody, Sandalwood and cream. Nothing special definitely not worth buying. I heard so many people rave about it .. Was it water down and reformulated???', ""Smells old like 1970's vibe. Try a decant first as it's not for everyone ü§Æ"", ""Beautiful blend of creamy Sandalwood and opulent musk.  Citrus opening morphing into a woody/musky scent. Has a clean peppery-ness and a metallic edge reminiscent of other Creed fragrances. Suits men of any age, good for formal occasions in the spring and summer. Has a nod towards barbershop/shaving products, smells exactly like Gillette original scent shaving foam. Has a crossover with XS but isn't identical, this smells a lot more modern, airy, musky and luxurious. Projection is OK, longevity is hard to gauge properly, I would say less is more - spray wise."", ""I hated this fragrance the first time I wore it, I found it to be really metallic smelling from the sample I had but it grew on me. I got a full-size bottle of it and the batch has virtually no metallic smell and it smells actually really good. The start is really comparable to axe body spray but about an hour later it transforms and smells fantastic. It's like a citrus, woody ambergris musk. As long as longevity and projection this stuff is really strong on me, I've tried a lot of creeds in sample form and this one was the strongest and longest lasting by a long shot. I get a good 12+ hours on my skin and a few feet of projection even 6+ hours after putting it on. in my opinion it's still not worth full price as I got it at a discounter for 50% off but I'm happy with it and I always recommend trying fragrances before you buy bottles, so you aren't disappointed."", 'I like to layer Chanel Allure Homme Blanche over the original Allure Homme. That combo is what this smells like. As it dries down it starts to smell like Green Irish Tweed.', '#129 in my ""Tour de Fragrance"" of 250 scents in 250 days. There\'s something unique going on here that I like behind all my normal faves of citrus, musk and amber, that gives it sharpness and edge it would otherwise lack, but it also has some kind of vegetable smell like celery or something, that\'s off-putting. It\'s a moderate projector at most, a good 4-5 hours of skin scent. But even if not for that weird vegetable smell there\'s nothing sexy or seductive going on here (my girlfriend just thinks it smells ""soapy""), and that\'s just not worth $200 and up to me.', 'I love it. A musky, soapy, slightly powdery and sour(y) citrusy masterpiece that works so well casually or dressed up. A true Swiss Army knife fragrance that seems to fly under the radar compared to other Creed fragrances. I went through two samples and wasted no time buying a full bottle ‚Äî will probably always have a bottle of this wonderful juice on my shelf. And a bonus that it‚Äôs a beautiful, understated bottle as well.  The only knock is that I wish it lasted a bit longer ‚Äî like most here have said ‚Äî but I seem to be averaging about 3-4 hours with ok projection - so I‚Äôll take that.  4/5 for me.', ""Some people have described it as a clean office fragrance, and it could be that, but it has more zest and sting- enough to be fun anywhere. More like it's -also- an office fragrance. Very good. The vetiver note not listed here does good work. Got some compliments and sniffs on my inner arm where I sprayed it. I got a deal on a 100ml bottle so paid about half price- I don't know if I would pay the normal price but I'm really happy with what I got. Clean, sharp, with just a smidge of excitement."", ""Just got my 30ml decant ... It's Green Irish Tweed mixed with Silver Mountain Water and musk. Not a bad scent but this was the first thing I smelled."", 'Smells like the late 90‚Äôs. I have always like Himalaya. Bright citrus opening with a beautiful and masculine, musk, ambergris, and woody base. I recently did a side-by-side comparison with another late 90‚Äôs in a bottle scent, Percival. They don‚Äôt smell similar but do have that woody, citrus, musk DNA. The ladies liked Percival better, but I was undecided. This is a great and versatile signature scent.', 'The himalaya name and white bottle fit nicely with this scent profile. Easy ‚Äòdumb reach‚Äô that won‚Äôt win any niche olfactory awards, but will have you smelling nicer and richer than 99.9% of people.  Sandalwood wrapped up in comforting musk and a nice zesting of citrus peel.  Different scent profile to GIT. Both are easy to wear, but I think you‚Äôve got to be nose-blind or blinded by hating Creed so much that you can only see the glass half empty.', ""A simple bitter-sour scent profile like grapefruit juice inside a sandalwood jar. Not so loud gentleman freshie nor long lasting cologne. It's just right except for the price"", ""I imagine a Japanese Shinto temple to smell like this- woody, slighly oriental. I don't pick up on much citrus in the opening, just dry woods and gunpowder (in a good way). Good performance for Creed, and an overall nice offering."", 'Smells like more citrus version of Creed Silver Mountain water and also Armaf Derby CH Blanche. Not at all impressed and not worth the price.', 'Tried this a tester brought straight from Creed. Does not work with my skin at all. I get a 5 minutes of the citrus, then it disappears completely. I would be incredibly annoyed if I had brought this as a full bottle.', 'Smells like a fuzzy and sweet green irish tweed in the opening', 'I tried this in a shop tester. It smelled wonderful on skin. Nice and fresh. Lasts for a decent amount of time for a citrus fragrance (4-5 hours). Would love to try it again. Certainly seems full bottle worthy.', 'Agree with many of the reviewers here. Reminds me of a cheap sports shower gel. Just tried a tester, will not be buying this one. It is long lasting though, like the other Creed perfumes.', 'I do get the comparison with GIT, but this is a very simple fragrance. Lemon, sour grapefruit and a slightly bitter musky earthy dry down. Does not smell like SMW, this one is a very simplistic designery freshie. Clean lemon shower gel vibes, but no depth at all. If you are willing to spend the money, I recommend Royal Water or GIT which are vastly superior fragrances.', ""A lighter, soapier version of Green Irish Tweed. Almost as if you took a dryer sheet and sprayed it with GIT and then let it air out a bit. If that sounds like something you'd like, give it a shot."", 'I ordered a bunch of samples from all kinds of houses and this is the one that stood out. It is a beautiful, citrus, musky scent that I just couldn‚Äôt stop sniffing and had to put a little spray on when I came home from work.

It's really not for me."", 'My all time favorite', 'Younger version of GIT... good but when I want this DNA I want the full blown thing. Solid thougu', 'Himalaya smells very much like Green Irish Tweed with similar performance. Buy the one you find cheaper!!', ""I get a barbershop vibe from Himalaya. I'm not getting citrus at all. Maybe its my batch, CM3919P01. I have At The Barber by MMM on one wrist and Himalaya on the other and I'm getting a lot of similarities.  I love this when I want to smell fresh and clean. It's very office friendly and plays best in late fall, winter, and early spring. My biggest complaint is longevity. I only get about an hour of projection and a semi strong skin scent for another 3. When buying a Creed frag I expect at least 6-8 hours of projection. I understand this is a freshie and isn't supposed to be a beast. But it should at least project for a few hours. And I feel like if I overspray it will be too heavy and cloying.  I LOVE wearing this. It's a top 5 scent for me.  I'd love to get my hands on an old bottle of XS. But I don't trust Ebay enough to order one. Anyone know a reputable site to score an old bottle?  Edit: The bottle has matured a bit and I‚Äôm getting about double the performance now. It took a couple months. Same with my GIT and OS. Curiously my RW has not. I will be buying another 100 ML when this runs out.

I don‚Äôt wear it myself but I would literally love my house to smell like this all day long!', 'Very nice opening, really high quality scent. It dries to a soapy, expensive fresh shower gel with a hint of white floral sweetness.', 'Yeah this smells like silver mountain water in the very opening but then the dry down smells like CK Defy like the dry down is an exact clone of CK defy', 'Really solid. Mature without being old mannish. The cedar and musk combination is very, very mossy to me. I was amazed oak moss wasn\'t listed on the notes because it\'s very strong and prominent. This was a bit too much when I tried it in warm weather, but on a cooler day it really shined. I wish the citrus notes of the opening stuck around a bit longer. This is definitely a ""power frag"" when worn out or to the office. Will update this if I have any new discoveries while wearing. Update: After wearing a dozen or so more times, I\'d definitely say this is a frag for sub 70 degree days. Really blends nicely with cooler weather, and I would wear it as often as I could if I had a full bottle. I\'m sure it\'s not everyones cup of tea but I have also gotten many compliments.', 'The opening smells the most ""designer"" of all creeds, but isnt a bad thing. I find it easily mass appealling. The mid and drydown on my skin comes quickly - about 30 minutes onwards - and (on my skin) settles into a woody accord reminiscent of Nuit D\'issey for men EDT. So similar in fact that i cant tell them apart. Much later when you shower with hot water, the fragrance surprises by unleashing a floral scent from the opening, but much softer and smoother. Himalaya is an easy wear and i would not hesitate wearing it as a signature scent. Also, the newer (grey juice) Paco Rabanne XS smells 90% like this all the way to the drydown but is so weak the scent disappears completely off my skin after 2 hours. They both become skin scents within the first hour, btw. Interestingly the (yellow juice) original formulation of XS from the 90s which smells more intense was launched earlier than Himalaya.', ""I can't even lie, at my first whiff of this at Neiman Marcus I knew I had to have it. The scent caught me off-guard and I found it so appealing in a quirky way. It also helps that it comes in this awesome silver, alien-looking flacon. I wanted to buy it right there and then...but it was out of stock. Thank goodness, though, because I found it from a third-party website at literally half the price. It finally arrived today and I decided to wear it. I realized what drew me to it: a distinctive, metallic, very icy feel with a citrus background. The iciness/frosty quality that's dominant throughout reminded me of fresh snow being melted in the sun, and it did truly take me on a vicarious trip to the Himalayas. However, as much as I get the cold-temperature vibe from the scent profile itself, I'd argue this cologne is more suited to warmer months, as: a) it'll perform better, and b) it'll be refreshing to smell cool mountainous glacier ice in the scorching heat of the summer. Oddly, I do think there's a similarity between this and Silver Mountain Water, but I find the notes in this more suited to my skin chemistry. Between those two, though, having at least one of them is a must (in my humble opinion) if you are a collector, or growing to be one. It's top-notch perfumery that perfectly and aptly evokes the vibe engraved on the front of the bottle. I know the price is steep, but I found this for $180 when it's normally $300-$350. To me, that's still very much worth it for an excellent scent profile.

The most addictive fragrance I have ever had. Truly amazing silage and longevity. I can describe Himalaya as a ""woody-fresh\'\', metallic, classy and outstanding. Works very well on my skin in cold weather. Pure love!', 'I\'ve been working my way through house of Creed by way of small decants from a vendor I\'ve found to be trustworthy. I even sprung for a full bottle of GIT, would for a few others as well if I were wealthy, and the ones I couldn\'t see wearing or even didn\'t particularly like, I at least appreciated. They\'ve all been excellent in their own way.  Himalaya is the first Creed scent I was just disappointed by.  The initial blast is pure alcohol, period. I quickly picked up an odd barbershop note... not odd, really, in fact, very common and familiar, which is what\'s odd, for a Creed. But I\'ve learned never to judge a Creed until after the first 30 minutes . So, I was patient.  30 minutes later, I said, well, this is definitely a Creed. It has that rich Creed base that I\'ve become very familiar with, I have no idea what it is (ambergris?) but I think of it as a ""satiny"", ""lustrous"" smell, if that makes sense. And on top of that... nothing else. If I inhale deeply I still get that very conventional barbershop note.  It faded to a skin scent relatively quickly. Over the course of the day I\'ve fairly bathed in it, reapplying it heavily as it\'s faded, hoping to catch a whiff of what so many people are raving about. This just doesn\'t have any of the personality or ""wow"" factor that every other Creed I\'ve tried so far has had to one degree or another. First one I probably wouldn\'t bother buying even if price weren\'t an object. My favorite Creeds seem to me to all have that characteristic base, which I do love, and then meld that seamlessly that with something else fantastic and unique. But Himalaya takes that base, and then does nothing with it. Except perhaps tops off the gap usually occupied by something interesting with a little touch of something very generic and conventional, maybe. And maybe even just a little perfumey and feminine.  So far, Creeds always reliably smell better than anything else, and there are always cheaper colognes that people will say smell similar, but the cheaper alternatives have never proven to be worth it and despite the much higher price I\'ve always thought the Creeds always proved to be a much better value. This is the first time I don\'t feel that way. If I want to smell this nondescript, there are much cheaper barbershop scents (which I do wear and enjoy) that this really is so trivial an improvement on that the vast price difference isn\'t worth it.', 'Oh wow...looking through all my old scents...I had a super small decant of this from waaaay back.

Try it, if you don't like it @me"", 'Creed Himalaya 2002 ""Amber Woody"" Olivier and Erwin Creed Notes:  Top: Calabrian Bergamot, Grapefruit, Sicilian Lemon Middle: Sandalwood Base: Musk, Ambergris, Cedar This fragrance lasts alot longer than Creed Vetiver. Creed Vetiver uses Mandarin for the citrus in the top note. Creed Vetiver has the Vetiver in the middle which is not present in the Creed Himalaya. Himalaya lists just \'Sandalwood\' as a middle note--all by itself whereas Creed Vetiver designates Mysore Sandalwood along with Florentine Iris, and obviously. . . Haitian Vetiver. The Base of Himalaya is the same except it adds Cedar. The result is that Himalaya has no Vetiver, and the effect of Ambergris with no Vetiver around--plus Cedar is added. Ambergris as described by chemist Gunther Ohloff : \'humid, earthy, fecal, marine, algoid, tobacco-like, sandalwood- like , sweet, animal, musky, radiant. What I think is happening with the Ambergris is it has a tobacco-like scent in this fragrance. It is dancing with the Cedar and has a for-sure salty, marine- like quality. The combo of Cedar and Ambergris is new to me, and I think this is what is unique about Creed Himalaya. I like it alot. The Ambergris is nothing crass. Don\'t be afraid. This is not like a whale burping in your face. This is a really unique and natural thing. Why the difference in longevity? I could be wrong, that is why. Still, Mysore Sandalwood versus Sandalwood may be a difference. Maybe different Musks. Wow.... so many different Musks out there. This fragrance should be evaluated in decant. Not because anything is wrong, it is just delightful. I am new to Creed and they have a broad product line. So far, Creed seems to make agreeable and highest quality fragrances, so you can\'t really go wrong. I think. . . . the way to go is to use decants and focus in on favorites. This juice is not inexpensive so bumbling around could be reckless.', ""This is a bit of a quiet masterpiece in the Creed range.  The opening is fairly citrus heavy with a beautiful green, natural smell - somewhat classic barber shoppy vibe, albeit with a definite oriental note from the sandalwood. For me this fades after an hour, leaving one of the most elegant and addictive amber/musk bases I have come across. It manages to smell warm and welcoming whilst also retaining a heady, temple incense like quality. Incredibly agreeable and mass appealing in typical Creed fashion, this fragrance also feels luxurious and exotic.  Although overpriced, I've never smelled anything quite like it - certainly no dupe/clone has ever come close to the real deal.  I get about 30 mins of decent projection, followed by an hour or so of arm's length projection, after which it fades to more or less a skin scent. The amazing base will last until the next day on clothes, but is gone from my skin after about 5-6 hours.  For me, Himalaya does what it does better than any other fragrance I have come across. Addictive and refined."", 'Test wearing Himalaya for the first time. 3 hours in. It\'s indeed a pretty weak or ""moderate"" performer as the longevity rating here indicates. 7 sprays, including clothes. Pretty nice scent, but nothing mindblowing. Wouldn\'t make my top 20 overall in my collection. Definitely behind Bois du Portugal, Royal Oud, Viking, Green Irish Tweed, Aventus, Spice and Wood, EROLFA for me. Probably behind Original Vetiver and Virgin Island Water too. I don\'t have the others yet. Update: wearing again many months later. Its growing on me. Still too close to the skin performance-wise but scent profile is very nice. I\'ve never smelled Paco Rabanne XS, but it doesn\'t bother me if this is very similar. Get your nose on enough fragrances and you realize that scent profile groupings are basically everywhere and with every brand. If Himalaya is a ""rip off"" of XS then Roja\'s Oligarch is a rip off of Terre d\'Hermes, etc. etc. But Himalaya has very little similarity to Chanel Platinum Egoiste, that I can tell you. Lol.', ""So far I‚Äôve only owned full bottles of designer fragrances and never thought I‚Äôd drop the money for a full flacon of a niche fragrance, let alone a Creed. I think Aventus was a fine scent but really overrated, kind of being overhyped by youtubers and trendy ‚Äúbest of‚Äù lists. Now, I have no problem with Aventus overall, and I don‚Äôt even have a problem with trendy youtube fragrance bros. They all have their place and I thank the youtubers and trends for introducing me to a brand like Creed in the first place!  I initially thought Green Irish Tweed or Silver Mountain Water were going to be the Creed scents I‚Äôd choose between to buy for my first ‚Äúfull bottle‚Äù niche frag. I‚Äôm genuinely grateful I discovered this one first.  I absolutely love this fragrance and it instantly clicked with me much more than GIT and SMW, and that‚Äôs high praise because I absolutely adore those scents and find them to be masterful and timeless creations. However, as of writing, Himalaya is my favorite fragrance I‚Äôve ever worn. It‚Äôs absolutely top notch and impeccably crafted and smells like a million bucks, seriously. In some ways I find it is kind of a blend between GIT and SMW‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs got the rich, slightly green/rugged masculine quality of GIT and the smooth, fresh crispness (a bit of a cooling effect, slightly metallic) of SMW, but it‚Äôs definitely its own scent, I‚Äôm just saying that for perspective in case you are a fan of those other scents.  From the very first blast, Himalaya is just heavenly, the citrus hitting your nose with a crisp freshness the likes I‚Äôve never smelled anywhere else. Sure, I‚Äôve smelled amazing woody/citrus frags with similar opening notes, but NEVER any that were this natural, with a smoothness and depth that only comes from the finest ingredients that money can buy. I get a lot of the divine citrus, that smooth, clean, yet slightly earthy sandalwood, and a sort of fuzzy, textured musk and ambergris. (EDIT: Fragrantica does NOT list all the official notes on this page and needs to be updated. I figured out what was giving it that texture.. Gunpowder!! It is definitely noticeable here, along with some pepper... it gives it a VERY unique, textured grit, which enhances the ambergris IMO... it's honestly amazing and truly unique). Its truly hard to describe in words, as it feels a bit earthy and musky but never too rough or offensive (I did find aventus could be offensive at times), and it‚Äôs blended so well it just feels like the purest, cleanest, most natural and comforting scent I‚Äôve ever worn. It oozes a sort of weathered confidence and oneness with nature. This is not for the flashy, gaudy guy with a fast car who goes clubbing. This is for the guy who has seen and experienced the world first hand and has the patience, wisdom, and experience necessary to succeed at whatever he puts his mind to. He doesn‚Äôt need to tell you about all the things he‚Äôs done or plans to do, he just does it. It reminds me of the mountains, yes, but more so the great outdoors and the planet we live on. Some scents smell Italian, French, British, etc, but this smells worldly. lIt‚Äôs an all-encompassing adventure in a flacon. It‚Äôs clean as hell, it‚Äôs fresh yet it‚Äôs warm, it‚Äôs rugged and earthy yet still calming and smooth. It dries down to a slightly powdery, ultra-clean, resinous scent.  Also, this is completely masculine to me, silver mountain water is a much more unisex and softer scent. I‚Äôm 32 years old and a fan of fresh scents, I tend to avoid anything too heavy and oriental."", 'I neither get the association with the Himalayas, nor am I reminded of cold mountain air. It is a bit old style, but not in a bad way, it is quite likeable. I would also say it is rather simple, but this is also a plus here. A very enjoyable and calming fragrance. 8/10', 'Smelled this on a friend, and I knew I had to get it! The citrus combining with the sandalwood is so intoxicating, its like what a previous user wrote, ""A dense fog"". The first time I smelled this, it smelt like metal, like taking a bunch of keys with your hands, that smell and you x2, but in a smooth, graceful, and elegant way. It truly is an underrated gem by the house of Creed, as this is not talked about often, but I can see why hahah.

It has the top notes of the BdC EDT with the sandalwood adding a creamy base of the Parfum version...and some powdery notes to round it out.

High price and lackluster performance is probably why this one doesn't get more love."", 'Himalaya is a soft but masculine citrus fragrance. When it dries down, the sandalwood and musk come together in a good situation. It is then amplified by the ambergris.

As Himalaya dries down many have pointed that it smells like a luxurious soap and I think they are right. In my head Himalaya is like a really great day when you just feel happy and relaxed. Starts like a sunny, cool morning and ends in a comforting soapy ambergris like you just had the best bath of your life and now you are laying beside your fiance.

Out of the 7 Creed‚Äôs that I own, I would re-buy 3 of them, one of which would be Himalaya. Clean and musky, with some woods and a hint of ambergris. It‚Äôs a very simple fragrance but it works so well. I have received positive comments when wearing Himalaya and I don‚Äôt think that this would offend anybody. Great for the office and in casual settings (probably wouldn‚Äôt wear it formally but I have other Creed‚Äôs for that). My 2017 bottle has excellent longevity too - literally all day. It doesn‚Äôt project much, but this isn‚Äôt the type of fragrance that‚Äôs worn for attention.

I agree it is simple and easygoing for all seasons. I personally prefer spring and fall as the best times to wear. Quality as with all Creeds with their signature ambergris and musk in the the dry down. Can be quite strong in terms of projection so 2 sprays will do the job. IMO: 7/10', 'The opening to my nose is 99% Green Irish Tweed. After the dry down it settles into a beautiful ambergris and musk. It‚Äôs a people pleaser and is a Swiss Army knife if you need a niche dumb reach. For a Creed, this one has better than average longevity.  It‚Äôs not super unique but what it does, it does very well. Edit: Been wearing this more in the cold weather and is still fairly reminiscent of GIT but more soapy (Irish Spring). It also has a vey fleeting vibe of Brut. It comes and goes but it‚Äôs very faint and doesn‚Äôt last long (I kinda like it!).  I‚Äôm not sure why Himalaya isn‚Äôt talked about more...especially for office or casual wear. It‚Äôs so easy to pull off and inoffensive. The ambergris and musk in the dry down are better than any other office fragrance I own! Cheers!', ""It arrived today, and I get it. My third Creed, having tried 10 of them and owning clones of most of them. I have worn a sample of Himalaya, and own a good dupe, Alexandria's Himayan Mountains. But of course the real thing is as always a thing of delicate beauty that can't be fully replicated. That Creed DNA--ambergris/musk. That minty, herbal wind right after the superb citrus blast. Grapefruit is the true icy character here, though that seems odd. I am surprised the sandalwood isn't more prominent as in dupes. After all, Creed has it as the sole mid-note. But the revelation I now have is that Himalaya is the theme to all the Creed freshy variations. It acts as the template, the essence and satellite for them. This gets knocked for being the least distinctive of them all, and maybe so, but it hints at them all (or they all hint at it). And this is safe, mass-appealing and luxuriously inviting. If those first two adjectives are dirty words, don't take them as such; a Creed this friendly is still a Creed, and the wearer feels and smells delectable as only Creed can provide. The strength is misleading. The nature of this and many fresh Creeds leads to anosmia, but it impressively projects, make no mistake. If another fragrance can state its citrus as natural yet loud as this, I haven't found it."", 'A short, sweet, and likely to be unpopular review, but this is exactly what I thought when I sprayed it and my opinion remains unchanged: Creed Himalaya - an extraordinarily expensive way to inhabit the (albeit not unpleasant) smell of a bottle of Lynx shower gel!

I wear this frag day/night, hot/cold, office/play and it just works. Performs great and that musky/ambergris drydown drives 'em nuts.

So in a way I consider Himalaya my placebo, a feel-good fragrance that I feel good wearing. ****(*)', ""Pretty good but vintage XS when it first launched in the early 90's was better. Modern XS sucks so this is the play unless you can find early batches of XS that not turned. I unfortunately had one turn bad."", ""I have tried Paco Rabanne XS vintage and the newer reformulated version. They seem very similar at first, but in experience they're just not satisfying; they smell like cheap designer. Having owned a 10ml decant of Himalaya, I kept on reaching back for it and my wife keeps asking me what I'm wearing so I had to pull the trigger on an original bottle. I love the pillow soft creamy ambergris besides its soapy, clean and fresh character. It does seem very generic in a way, but I still love wearing it, especially at home. It's the only original Creed I own. For the other Creed's I am more than happy with (very well done) dupes, but for Himalaya the dupes did not work for me. Quite ironic if you think about how 'generic' Himalaya smells, clone brands just don't seem to grasp its simplistic character."", 'Get XS by Paco Rabanne, its even better', 'Mysterious scent.

And here let me slap you another one.. high five. That's for smelling like pure money."", ""Himalaya is just all about this slightly icy cool quality. It has the menthol-like feel with a fresh citrus and strong woody scent, which all blend nicely and nothing really sticks out. As the icy feel melts away, the scent gets more oriental-like sweet and really clean musky but nice. Even at the base, the scent still stay fresh and somewhat soapy sharp. I find it very exhilarating and masculine in a good way. I like! This is not something I gotta have, but it's nice to try, and the icy manly feel is very interesting in a fragrance. I wouldn't mind having one or two when I won a lottery. Update: Oops I robbed a bank and bought a bottle. :)"", ""BRILLIANT and highly under-rated fragrance IMO. I've owned this fragrance for years, but have typically only worn it in during the Fall months. Shame on me, because I recently re-discovered this fragrance and have been wearing it quite regularly during the Spring and Summer months.  Citrus, musk and creamy sandalwood that are blended with a very nice and natural-smelling ambergris note. It's a very nice, excellent quality, masculine scent that I find perfect for an office setting; On one hand, I could say that Himalaya is not spectacular but rather a safe, masculine, fresh-woody fragrance. On the other hand, that's part of this Himalaya's charm (it's just solid, reliably great scent) that I find to be highly under-rated. I get an honest 7-8 hours out of this fragrance with moderate projection. Again, perfect for a day in the office during the Spring and Fall, but I've fallen in love with this one and find it to be a versatile fragrance that is appropriate for most occasions. If you're a fan of a gentleman's sandalwood, musk and ambergris scent then you should give this one a try."", 'Very underrated. Such a clean, great smelling scent. It‚Äôs timeless. One of Creed‚Äôs best and massively undervalued. Prefer this over SMW.', ""Still a 10/10 for me, will never be without a bottle. I must say the new batches are still very nice, I've owned 2007-2022 batches and I still love the new juice. Older juice is more dense though. This works year round and for any occasion. In summer is it bright vibrant uplifting and winter crisp cool that cuts through the cold air. I'll admit I didn't like it years back when I first tried it but ir grew on my fast. Absolutely love it!"", ""Smells like that old-fashioned bar of soap that you washed your hands with at your grandma's house - pleasant enough - but your grandma didn't spend over $200 for her soap."", 'I\'ve never written a bad review about anything, but I\'ll make an exception for Himalaya. Not because the citrus and ambergris clash horribly, transforming what should have been an ordinary woody ""men\'s fragrance"" into a soapy mess which refuses to settle down.  That would be bad enough. But what gets to me is the Tibetan-mountaineering-gunpowder-macho back story which Creed came up with to sell us this hilariously clumsy and unadventurous scent. For a small fortune, too. For a much more inspired take on the Himalayas, try Bertrand Duchaufour\'s ""Dzongkha"" for l\'Artisan Parfumeur.', ""Lovely fragrance, but just too sharp and intense for me. It's wonderful once it's dried down and the citrus gives way to wood/musk, but on me that takes a good 4 hours in the winter and practically doesn't happen at all in the summer. I've taken to spraying it on the inside of my suit jackets (lightly) at night, so that by the next morning the scent has mellowed into something appropriate for the office."", ""Straight up soap.

Perhaps more to ""unisex"". May not be very obviously vetiver-ish. Too soapy to the extent that even reminds me of Amouage Lyric Man!', 'Quality fragrance. I sprayed once on my hand and I can still smell it hours later. But, just like Dyptique\'s Vetyverio, EM Molecule 03, and a few others, it\'s too much for me.

Not as bad as Hemingway and Sultan Vetiver, but still. Lunar Vetiver? No way. LV is much smoother and much more wearable. It\'s actually one of the best unisex vetivers around.', ""There are two accords that I have uncontrollable weaknesses for: leather and vetiver. It might have been a foregone conclusion that I was going to really like Vetiver Extraordinaire, particularly since it's a Malle perfume composed by Dominique Ropion. I am happy to confirm that conclusion, yet also say I am pleasantly surprised. Vetiver Extraordinaire is not quite what I expected. Vetiver is a shape shifter. Depending upon the species, terroir, and extraction method, you can get numerous different characteristics out of vetiver - some very pleasant, some quite challenging - from hyper green, aromatic, salty and sweaty qualities to fetid and swampy to smoky, woody, and incense-like, and combinations thereof. Malle and Ropion bring all of vetiver's characteristics out front-and-center in Vetiver Extraordinaire, with the help of some other materials. The top of the fragrance is a burst of bitter bergamot and oranges, and pepper. Vetiver is also present in the top as well, and what the fruits and pepper call forward is vetiver's spicy, fruity, green, bitter, and semi-sweaty note. What's notable about this is a lack of piquancy typically associated with these notes, that nose-tingling feeling that is common with the bitter citrus, pepper, and hyper green vetiver. The surprise I mentioned at the beginning is this smoothness, and also quite a welcome change. These rather challenging characteristics of vetiver are not muted or held back, just kept in-check and made to behave. Once the top notes dry down, the green aromatic vetiver continues but is given a heaping dose of cashmeran - and a high quality cashmeran to boot. Presenting types of milky sandalwood and fresh cedar notes with the green aromatic quality of the vetiver sitting over top of them, the cashmeran also has this effect of superbly texturizing the greenness and woodiness to a silky/velvety smoothness. The heart of this perfume is so good. Not only is one side of vetiver's character present - the green, aromatic, and salty side - but with the addition of cashmeran its woody side is brought forward as well while keeping to the mandate of good behavior. The brand uses words like elegant and sophisticated and playful to describe Vetiver Extraordinaire, and that is completely correct. While somehow being quite complex and of very high quality, it also manages a sort of lightness of being and an unrefined childlike energy that puts a big grin on my face. The final and very pleasant surprise comes with the last dry down, which, fortunately, unlike most modern vetivers, doesn't descend into a heaping messy pile of rough-cut jagged woods. Instead, the lightness of being becomes lighter still, and a mossy note and musk accord nestle themselves on your skin. This is a most excellent vetiver, one of the best I have ever smelled (I have to say that quietly because my vintage bottle of Guerlain EdC is within earshot). Malle and Ropion have taken this most humble and ubiquitous of grasses, a staple for thousands of years across the tropics, cleaned it up and dressed it up without dampening its energetic side. Superb."", ""Extraordinarily smelly. Some people have a funny idea of sophistication )) It smells like a swamp, peat and sphagnum moss. Damp and musty. Fortunately, projection and staying power are very poor. Fortunately, I only spent money on a sample. I'm still trying to replace the old Sycamore EDT and trying different vetivers. This one is the worst so far."", ""Just buy Sultan Vetiver and save the money. It's a better, longer lasting version of this. Quality is also on par."", 'Clean, smooth, fresh vertiver and woods.

It is a good choice even for blind buy, if you like woody oak-moss scents. Scent: peppery, a little bit salty, mossy, and in the middle of scent vetiver.  I do not feel licorice like a note or accord. But profile of a scent goes in that way. It is not usual men scent, I do not feel you can use it everywhere or take a compliment every time. vetiver extraordinaire sounds right in every season from winter to fall.

There's a zesty, spice-cupboard element in the opening that I find interesting and dimensional, but on my skin it flattens out and loses a lot of its dimensionality fairly early on in the dry down.  I also get a strange sort of musty and mulchy background note that wobbles between intriguing and off-putting from minute to minute. Overall this one isn't for me."", 'Love this smell‚Ä¶. My favorite Vetiver fragrance but just doesn‚Äôt last on my skin for some reason.', ""Smells great. Manly. Luxurious. Almost like a gentleman's version of Sauvage because of the peppery mix with freshness. Earthy and smoky and fresh.  When it comes to performance, I think some people here became anosmic. This one lasts way over 12 hours. I have a recent batch. It doesn't radiate like old batches of Interlude but it does last very long.  You have to try it before you buy it. It contains a musky note, maybe from the cumin.  Pricing? Yeah, too much. But if you can afford it and you like it, go for it. It works everywhere."", 'Specimen vetiver with accentuated peppery and licorice facets Judging from a lot of the reviews below, particularly from those offering mostly immediate reactions, it appears this one is very misunderstood. It also makes sense considering vetiver is everywhere and everyone has at least on one occasion encountered Encre Noir or Grey Vetiver or even something Terre d‚ÄôHermes adjacent. Starting from the opening, what immediately caught my interest is the absence of heavy citrus dose. Citrus was always the means of opening the vetiver up, turning its robust peat like earthiness into more of a greenly hued oily woodiness (see Diptyque Vetiverio EDT where vetiver is at its most ethereal).  As Malle explains on the website, the vetiver here is a particular fractionated type, processed to rid the vetiver oil of its filthiest aspects, the leathery peat and earthy soil like quality. The result being a vetiver that doesn‚Äôt need much lift or dilution. Instead peppery facets dominate the top, a cold spicy opening, piquant but clean. As the fleeting pepper dissipates, I mostly pick up the clean root like vetiver, resembling licorice slightly, but also quite woody and with some residual earthiness. While the opening feels fresh and cool, the base keeps on developing over several hours, a slight glow of myrrh and some smokiness, indeed a suggestion of caraway. Over time I pickup up more sandalwood, surprisingly not much oakmoss to my nose. Overall quite a bold composition, not in a stark or odd way, more so in the way it stays true to its self, vetiver from start to finish, peak quality through and through. Something I like to wear on solemn and contemplative days, second only to Sel de Vetiver or Sycomore.', 'It‚Äôs in the details. This is without doubt another masterful composition by Ropion. Very elegant and masculine. Quite aromatic for being a vetiver-centric composition. The bitter orange complements the the grassy-aromatic-bitter vetiver perfectly. A bit peppery-spicy, but it‚Äôs only noticeable in the beginning, and honestly, I think it fits the composition very nicely as well. The base-composition is perhaps its foremost strength. Everything is perfectly balanced. It‚Äôs not loud, nor extravagant, or screaming for attention. It‚Äôs elegant and effortless. Beautiful work.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, performance is not acceptable. It fades away just too fast. I imagine it has been reformulated for the worse, like many others from the house. I curse this sad evolution of Frederic Malle.', 'Kinda boring straight vetiver scent. All the other notes are very subdued. Average projection and longevity, nothing ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù there.  Reminds me of TDH Intense Vetiver but much lighter and airier.', ""OK, sommelier here, but will try to be romantic: 10 min after spraying I get a dry orange peel nose dominating, something boozy as well, Sweet fortified aged italian white wine type of a dried fig character. There are some palo santo type of woody notes, I guess it's cedar and licquorice. That's it for now. A verrry calming scent. It wants you to sit down and contemplate or have a casual conversation. The scent might develop but I experience it as a bit underwhelming and of course not worth the price. I feel bad for being honest since I know there is great effort and quality behind it. It's a really good perfume, but maybe more suitable for a male duck to wear it. When is your duck's next birthday?"", ""i wouldn't really call this vetiver extraordinaire - in fact, the vetiver is very much overpowered and overlooked, which didn't bode well for myself who was looking for vetiver heavy fragrances. it's very fresh and earthy - i can smell soil, and even mint, although there's no notes that match those smells within it. i find the fragrance as a whole a little boring - it is quite generic and masculine, until the softer woody drydown kicks in. for the price, it's very mid, and nothing stands out about it. and once again. barely a hint of vetiver 5/10 disappointing"", ""Got this as a sample. I have tried many vetiver scents and I would say many are not so great, many remind me of raid bug spray on the dry down. I was hopeful after reading the reviews that this would be different and maybe loved, but alas the dry down just smells like raid bug spray. The opening is quite nice and if it stayed like that it would be top tier but really only smells good for a few mins IMO. With the dry down this smelled a bit more peppery to me than some other vetiver fragrances but the end was the same as all the others I don't care for. I still haven't found a vetiver fragrance I truly love. But so far my favorite vetiver forward fragrances are still Roja Dove Vetiver Pour Homme and Tom Fords Grey Vetiver. Still a bit bug spray but much more interesting outside of that."", 'Smells like a beautiful spa, but also slightly like parshnip or some other earthy root vegetable. Unexpectedly delightful. Calming in a way that lavender is calming, or maybe even like to rosemary oil with some salty breeze from the sea in the Mediterranean summer evenings. Wonderful.', 'Lemonade / mineral water', 'honestly the best you can get with vetiver fragrances, not that i have tried THAT many but then again..i think i found the one :)', 'Vetiver Extraordinaire was on my short list for awhile, while searching for ""the perfect vetiver"". Something with the best qualities of all the different vetiver varieties‚Äîgrassy, earthy, woody, smoky, yet fresh and uplifting.  My first impressions were a love, and even though I haven\'t smelled VE in a while, I can still distinctly call to mind its unique aroma. The bitter orange and spiced opening, the woody/subtle oakmoss tinged backbone, and the very faithful and present vetiver that does center the qualities I was looking for.  After some time, I ended up growing tired of Vetiver Extraordinaire and didn\'t pick up a bottle due to a few reasons. The main dealbreaker was a very tenacious musk note in the base that starts to rear its head in the heart, and just doesn\'t quit. It\'s somewhere between a soapy and makeup bag/lipstick feel, and feels a bit too cloying. It leans a bit feminine, which isn\'t a dealbreaker, but it also gives a off a ""tacky conspicuous wealth"" vibe, which is a dealbreaker. In general, the luxury marketing markup is a big turn off, especially with brands like Lalique, Guerlain, Essential Parfums, CDG, La Curie etc. offering quality classic and avant garde offerings for far less.  Full retail for a 100ml of Vetiver Extraordinaire is $410 USD, which is laughable for 99% of us.  The musk note, plus the absolutely ludicrous price, firmly swept this off my to-buy list.  I still think it\'s a very well done fragrance, but I have other vetiver scents I quite like (Guerlain, Vettiveru 2, Private Label, Encre Noire) that fill the hole in my heart just fine. Still looking for a more primal, simple almost soliflore vetiver that bridges the gap between fine perfumery and aromatherapy. I\'ve got my eye on Heeley\'s Vetiver Veritas next. The search continues!', 'Unisex vetiver fragrance which has excellent longevity and projection. I really love this and it is one of the best vetiver fragrances out there, also the best fragrance from the brand. It is not overly soapy or too dry, it is perfectly balanced. Safe blind buy if you like vetiver and want to smell expensive. :)', 'I don\'t like Vetiver perfumes, I mean typical Vetiver which are almost all masculine. Otherwise I love to wear many masculine perfumes but Vetiver is something which is not attractive on women.  First I was thinking that there is nothing ""extraordinaire"" in this but the more I worn it the more I came into the conclusion that this is the first Vetiver which is absolutely beautiful and pretty on women so this is unisex Vetiver. Of course it\'s because of how Vetiver is made, how much there is Vetiver in it but it\'s mostly because of wonderfully made blend. Vetiver is not sharp at all, not off putting nor too strong. Citruses don\'t have a big role which is more than fine for me since those can be tricky to my nose. They are in the opening but otherwise they stay far away in the background. Woody notes in the middle, especially Sandalwood softens Vetiver like Cashmeran as well and the result is velvety soft and indulgent. Musk in the base supports them perfectly. I\'m not the right person to analyse Vetiver more since mostly I can\'t wear them enough. I can say for example that Nishane\'s Sultan Vetiver and Roja\'s Vetiver are very good top quality vetiver scents but honestly I don\'t use my time for that category. However, I can highly recommend V√©tiver Extraordinaire to both women and men.

The male produced pollen while the female will developed into fruit bunches after cross pollination happened. The male inflorescences at some time in its life cycle will matured up and begin an anthesis stage. In which during this time it released pollen, the flower will turn golden yellow and it produced a really really nice scent.

People mention that as a vetiver fragrance but it doesn\'t really fit the bill to me, as the dry down is more musk and the bitter green is coming from galbanum and oakmoss. While sitll slightly bitter, this is a purer vetiver fragrance than FL, in which you get all those diffusively earthy and rooty grass-like aromas that feel so delicate and refreshing, which I believe is common for haitian vetiver. The twist here comes from leaning into a warm-spice direction with the fruity heat from pink pepper and cloves. It\'s a really interesting way to fill out the heart since other florals and spices like nutmeg or cardamom or other things can render vetiver feeling dry and dusty, which you see in Guerlain\'s Vetiver and a few other ""cool spice"" takes on the plant. I find citrus usually helps pull it out of that dusty dimension with it\'s naturally ""juicy"" associations, and fortunately the citrus here is very natural and sugar-less. The mix of woods and myrhh also compliments everything so well by extending that charming spice blend into the base. I love how clean it feels while connecting the dots from spicy and alive, to earthy and comforting without feeling too mature. I still think it\'s probably not worth a full bottle but for lovers of this style and lovers of the note, it\'s a great perfume to get your hands on. The dry down is less unique and a more predictably light and fresh haitian vetiver, but maybe when I\'m in the mood to consolidate my collection I\'ll fall back on this to replace what I have.', 'I bought Dossier‚Äôs interpretation of this fragrance & it smells exactly like tequila right from the bottle!

Ok, slightly familiar scent, but after racking my brain most of the day it wasn't until reading other's reviews that the scent (I'm assuming the vetiver portion) landed with a familiar memory, shaving foam.

It is still lingering after 6 hours, but does this matter if I more or less forget I even sprayed a fragrance today?

Green, fresh and with mass appeal, it is masculine-leaning and easy to wear. While I dislike the opening, it gets better and has its moments.  VE opens with a slightly bitter citrus note, with damp, herbal vetiver present from the beginning. For me, this opening is surprisingly jarring and unpleasant - it simply reminds me of the squeeze of lemon and sprinkle of herbs used to garnish salmon. Thankfully, this subsides, and it improves considerably as it develops. It mellows, becoming more dry and cohesive as it develops on my skin. Here, the vetiver is bolstered by woody and spicy notes, giving a dry, grassy impression. Balsamic, resinous notes creep in as it dries down further, complementing the vetiver beautifully. Here, VE is at its best, and the green, woody vetiver note really shines. There is a whisper of mossiness as it fades, becoming an earthy, musky skin scent. Sillage and longevity are both moderate, and it fades to a skin scent within five hours on me.  Masculine-leaning, subtle and reasonably traditional, this is a nice vetiver-centred scent, but the performance is lacking for its price. Guerlain V√©tiver, even the current version, is a superior vetiver scent in my opinion. 3/5 (points lost for the fish dinner opening, but that is perhaps simply down to an unfortunate personal association).', ""a sophisticated vetiver scent; the opening citrus is nice. unfortunately I go anosmic to this pretty quickly and the perfomance is rather average. a very dry and woody perfume, this is unisex leaning masculine- i could see a classy older man wearing this. it's a safe, uncontroversial, and honestly pretty forgettable scent. i like this perfume but nothing I could justify spending $400 on for 100ml."", ""First of all I genuinely like the scent profile. That earthiness of the vetiver and smokiness of the woods with some crisp freshness is great. Not as fresh as Guerlain vetiver or Tom Ford Grey Vetiver and not as woody as enre noir l'extreme. Kind of sits in the middle but hints of each in the fragrance.  In all honesty though at that price point it is not worth your money. Longevity and projection is no where near as good as those are and to be honest you could buy all 3 of them for the price of one bottle of this. This smells closer to encre noir l'extreme than the other 2 and if that is what you are going for you can pick that up for literally ¬£20 from discounters.....no brainer!!! This is a ¬£60 100ml fragrance not the ¬£240 you find in most shops. Nice, but not unique, like I said go for encre noir l'exetreme you'll be just as happy and your wallet will be a lot more healthy."", ""This started off smelling dirty, but it dried down and mellowed out. I'd describe it as earthy, almost dirty but not quite, just dry and woody, like nature. It's very bland on me, very flat."", 'I agree with ghkim  In her words...The dry down is better than the opening. The opening has a sharp note that is borderline BO, but it does settle down later and it leaves an earthy, planty feel. It almost smells like walking through the indoor section of a botanical garden. Very green. And linier. It is masculine and somewhat sophisticated. I cannot pull the trigger on a bottle at $220/3.4 oz.', ""Opens with a blast of orangey citrus and then fades into a soapy, somewhat generic dry down. This scent is very dry in that there is no discernible sweetness I can detect coming from it. I'm not an expert on vetiver dominant fragrances, but having Guerlain Vetiver as my comparison, Vetiver Extraordinaire strikes me as completely different in every way. This is a scent that needs room to breathe (I may also be temporarily anosmic). Just minutes after application, I am smelling my arm but getting very little of anything. However, when I pull my arm away, occasionally something woody wafts into my nose. I can't really pin down the projection with this one and it seems weak, but more testing may be needed. Vetiver Extraordinaire has some similarity to Terre d'Hermes, but honestly the latter strikes me as a superior fragrance."", 'This has a beautiful natural smelling soapy vetiver opening, but quickly fades into a dry woody scent that becomes a bit sour after 1-2 hours.

I enjoy the dry down more than the opening."", ""One of the best vetiver based fragrances I ever smelled. It's a lovely green, subtile but rich smelling fragrance.

The lady in the Frederic Malle boutique told me that the vetiver used in this perfume is harvested from the base of a volcanic mountain. That is what gives the vetiver in this fragrance this beautiful slight ashy-ness .  It is fresh and beautiful but also has that ashy scent and an earthiness to the vetiver which makes this fragrance so irresistible. (And suitable for almost all seasons in my opinion. Maybe in the dead cold winter you would need you apply a little heavier to cozy up a little more) This is a perfectly blended masterpiece from a master!  The dominant note is vetiver but you get non heavy citruses (to me more bitter orange than bergamot) and the subtle spiciness (from the pink pepper and cloves) with the gorgeous support from the base of woods and musk.  This scent leans masculine but is not unapologetically so. It is what I would call a very classy fragrance.  10/10 for me  I must get myself a full size 100 ml bottle', 'One of my top vetivers.

Bravo!', 'Citrus and cedar opening, peppery/sparkly, not warm but bright and shiny vetiver - rather than dark and brooding Encre Noire, woody and fresh, invigorating, I like vetiver as a note, excited to try the Guerlain. Definitely masculine but I like it a lot! Just a tinge of dirt/root smell as it dries down. The musk is riding the line between slightly sweaty (but still nice)/animal musk and clean laundry musk, gets more animal and less clean over time. This is a very interesting one!

I was gifted a discovery set alongside this and went through a painstaking decision making process of choosing whether to keep the full bottle or not. Through a careful review I decided this was one I would get most wear out of.  I am a huge vetiver fan but can't compare this with Tom Ford's Grey Vetiver or Guerlain's Vetiver beacuse they are just such different fragrances. In my mind they are not comparable.  This is not very powerful but does linger and will catch me unaware when I am wearing it. I would however, as always, appreciate if it were a little stronger."", ""Really wanted to love this (like, I've held off simply buying Guerlain Vetiver so I could smell this). Lovely citrus and vetiver off the top. Settles into the mid 5-10 mins in where the freshness is replaced by a more typical 'earthy' vetiver, myrhh and a bit of wood. Good but not great. Performance is pretty limited--projection is on the mid to low end and I get maybe 4 hours out of three sprays. If I really loved the 'stinkier' vetivers, I'd probably just get Encre Noir or EN Sport and call it a day--better projection, a little less of a niche subtlety, but for a fraction of the price."", 'Niche Encre Noire Vetiver Extraordinaire is wonderful, vetiver-centric fragrance. It indeed smells of earthy woody vetiver, freshened up with lightly-sweet citruses and a dash of spices. It has such a stark similarity to the legendary Lalique Encre Noire & Encre Noire Sport, that one would believe if you tell them that Vetiver Extraordinaire is a flanker of Encre Noire. They have the same vetiver scent. However, Vetiver Extraordinaire is softer, less grassy, and the citrus sweetness is more obvious, as opposed to the dry and heavy smell of Encre Noire and the fresh lemony zest of Encre Noire Sport. Vetiver Extraordinaire also has a softer woody base made of sandalwood/myrrh/cedar. It\'s definitely a wonderful vetiver smell, but with the strong similarity to Encre Noire and the fact that Encre Noire costs literally ~8% the price of Vetiver Extraordinaire of the same size, is it really worth the price? A good performer, suitable for the mature during average-to-cool days. Big ""Like"" for the smell, pass on that price.', 'The opening is so fresh and slightly peppery. Very pleasant in the air around you. However, when the resinous touch kicks in from the myrhh, this turns into something generic and uninspiring. Sample before buying.', ""Woman weighing in here! I sprayed a bit of a sample of Vetiver Extraordinaire out of curiosity. I knew it would be traditionally masculine, but it's Dominique Ropion! I had to try it. Ugh!! A perfectly nice vetiver ruined for me by a body odor smell I could swear is cumin, but maybe just a very animalic musk. I was reading the reviews, checking to see if anyone else had that experience, as cumin isn't listed as a note, and sure enough, others did. That said, it might not be unappealing on a man. After all, cumin is a note found in many seductive feminine scents - I'm thinking specifically of Rochas Femme, but there are others. It's meant to provide that dirty, sweaty I just had a romp in the hay - no pun intended - smell, and combined may have the desired effect on the right guy! I'll have to have my husband wear it the next time I wear Femme, which he loves on me, incidentally!"", ""This is a classy gentleman scent. It doesn't project a lot but it works.

What can I say, the name says it all, it's Vetiver, and it's Extraordinary! ;o) To me it's very Vetiver dominant, I don't really get a whole lot of sense of citrus etc that others pick up on and that's part of the product. It has an incredibly clean scent in my opinion. This isn't what you wear to really stand out, it's what you wear in the spring/summer/maybe a little fall too, to smell nice. Not sexy, not crazy stand out, but just very very fresh and nice.  Projection is pretty solid, and longevity is decent too. Not great, but good. I typically use it for just going about my summer day, maybe give a dab or two if going to the gym.

So, longevity and sillage are great but i have issues with the scent itself. So, this is a mehh for me, but if sprayed sparingly it is ok.  6/10 ------------------- Edit More than 1 and a half year later approximately i have come to change my opinion.

A perfect scent for a hot summers day. Enjoy!', 'ginger, grass, vetiver, bitter orange, leathery, musty, latex, Halloween, baby powder i liked it but it was a weak performer  i would buy a travel size or maybe a smaller decant and that would be good enough for me', 'On my skin, it starts as an earthy orange-ish vetiver. Shortly after it will settle down as creamy/powdery cedar with a subtle nutty/spicy vetiver support, and will stay linear like that until the end. The edges are rounded by the strong presence of clean musk and vanilla who will give the soapy/soft effect, that makes this fragrance nearly unisex. What makes this one very interesting is the probable use of vetiver leaf oil on top of vetiver root, but keep in mind that this fragrance is more about cedar than vetiver. That said, I have to confirm what previous reviewers said: the projection is below average, but longevity is good. Too bad, because it is really well blended, but poor projection is a serious issue given the niche pricing.  In summary, doesn\'t hold the comparison with great vetiver frags, but taken as a cedar frag, it\'s a great one, that should have been named ""Cedre Extraordinaire"". Spring/Summer days, 25+', ""I get Vetiver root blended with musk and a tad bit of spice probably from linalool, it has an airy wet hay feel to it probably due to the scent accords being blended with Geraniol I assume.

Although the Vetiver seems to be contained towards the end, the results are non-the-less still joyful. A little sweeter than I like my vetiver to be but it's been pulled off nicely. The cedar and sandalwood work together beautifully creating a sweet and spicy concatenation. Longevity is great also. Not sure where the Encre Noir references are coming from these two smell absolutely nothing alike."", ""this is the best thing i have smelled in my entire life but at the same time the weakest projection as well...which makes it a tough decision whether to buy or not at such a price. the question here is why to restrict such beauty, same problem goes with 'french lover' which is another masterpiece tamed down to the lowest projection possible. it's not an offense to others if you smell good and if they can smell it...even leads to compliments."", ""Vetiver Extraordinaire has been reformulated. IFRA restricted vetiver oil back in 2015 so vetiver fragrances today are less concentrated due to restrictions of the essential oil. I put on a sample of Vetiver Extraordinaire this morning and I noticed right away it's not as strong as before and it doesn't last either unfortunately.

Well, let's just say I don't think it's worth that kind of money. Although the notes are somewhat natural, and project nicely, it just don't seem worth the expensive price tag. Basically, at the end of the day, it's a really nice 'green' scent. But honestly, this should be priced around the $40 mark, because it's a very natural fragrance, but let's be honest, it's nowhere worth the asking price. About the scent: It's woody, green and has a aromatic vibe. It has a fresh beginning and brings memory of Adidas Sport Field for some reason. The middle notes are a lot like 'Empire by Trump' without the longevity. Trust me, compare these two and I bet most of you can't tell the difference. The drydown however is significantly different. Empire disappears within 1 hour while Vetiver Exarodinaire Malle hangs around for 5+ hours -- hence the quality. You can tell which one is the cheaper scent. But still, the $260+ price tag is way too much for this fragrance."", ""Interesting - all the varied reviews!  Obviously some see it as masculine, but as I'm testing out a few perfumes for a male pal (I'm gifting him a few samples for Christmas) I have a few other men's perfumes on just now, and this leans a bit unisex to my nose, in comparison to Amouage's Journey Man for example, which I'm wearing on the other arm This definitely leans towards the citric/watery end of the vetiver spectrum in its opening notes. The vetiver feels dry, astringent and only very subtly smoky. I start to appreciate the underlying subtle incense more as it dries down. The bergamot definitely has the softer edges you expect from lime as opposed to lemon,it's convincingly fresh-squeezed and transparent, reminding me a bit of Jean Claude Elena style transparency, but not as sharp. If you're testing this in cold weather it will feel a bit light, even insubstantial maybe (also I'm wearing a very light spray), but I can imagine this performing beautifully in summer. For this time of year I'd find Creed's Vetiver more interesting with its smoky edge, or Miller Harris's gorgeously woody and sensual Vetiver Insolent, but those seem a bit heavy in hot weather.  The quality of this becomes far more evident in drydown, and I can see exactly how beautiful it would be in hot summer weather - dry, the sense of a fresh breeze, elegant, but with that underlying saltiness of vetiver - in the right weather this would be a quite sensual perfume. (I also just read in a review by Elena Vosnaki that this contains a slightly aquatic/sea breeze note called Florazone, which accounts for the breezy touch). I like it! Sillage soft, longevity good but it's subtle, it's got a truly lovely drydown that reminds me of some classics (oakmoss probably), though this is contemporary"", 'Simply the best Vetiver perfume.

What is left after an hour or two is a dry, grassy vetiver that starts to lift up the bergamot. I really appreciate the light touch of cloves, sandalwood, myrhh(the medicinal/""moldy"" quality perhaps?), and the pepper. Often vetiver has a cloying aspect to my nose, but this does not. Nor does it veer off in ""limey-vetiver-clean"" territory (bergamot uber!), or go too far in sandalwood which can become somewhat of a sweet wood. This is nicely balanced.

I was wearing Terre de Hermes, when my sample arrived. In the opening, VE reminded me of Terre de Hermes with the citrusy orange peel with vetiver. Frederic Malle Vetiver has more of a pronounced vetiver, the myrre and cloves give it warmth and depth, but it stays fresh also, so it\'s a fragrance of contrasts. It has a very sophisticated classy vib to it, not so fun and fruity as Terre. I am picking up a strong liquorish note in this, though none listed, it ads a piquant touch, not dominant in any way, but clearly noticeable. I can see how some would like that kind of touch. Maybe it\'s the bitter orange, it smells like some bitter spice. This and Sycomore are said to be two of the very finest vetiver based fragrances. Sycomore is more about just vetiver, an embellished vetiver. In Sycomore the vetiver is more vegital, green, fresh.. I prefer it as it\'s more raw and natural. Vetiver Extraordinar, is surely vetiver dominant but it\'s more rounded, complex perhaps.  Update: Opon my second wearing this VE, it\'s amazing how much it smells just like Penheligans "" Sartorial"", 90% same with vetiver amped up.

Plastic, rubber and small amounts of vetiver makes this unwearable for me. I feel like a walking rubber band every time I wear this. Sorry, I will pass........', 'The ""Real"" Vetiver... Let me start off first of all by saying that I am a huge fan of vetiver in all forms, and a huge fan of vetiver based fragrances. I find this one very authentic and extremely well made. The fragrance starts out with a hit of smoky, earthy vetiver and some citrus. I get the cloves and some dark spices (including black pepper) and it really brings out the ""dark"" aspects of the vetiver root. It is said that perfumer Dominique Ropion, who has done amazing stuff for the Frederic Malle line, used about 25% vetiver absolute when composing this. This makes it the highest concentration of vetiver in a perfume currently available on the market. As a fan of vetiver, this alone made me want to try it. I am also a huge fan of Guerlain Vetiver, but this one is slightly different. Where that one was a balance between vetiver and citrus (ie lemon), this one is a very dark, earthy, rooty type. It showcases the whole root of the plant, almost as it the earth is still clinging to it. I also compare this one to Lalique Encre Noir, but there are noticable differences. Although they are similar in ""feeling"" or ""tone"", the Lalique is sweeter, and less natural. This one is greener and earthier all the way.Vetiver Extraordinaire hits you with a strong blast of vetiver root and says ""here, deal with it"". You have no choice but to accept this in-your-face type of vetiver. As for me, I would consider purchasing, but only because I am a die hard vetiver fan. This one I think is a vetiver fan\'s vetiver, there is no compromise. But I must admit that if you are concerned about cost and versatility then there are other options, the Guerlain, Tom Ford version and the Lalique are all great choices, so don\'t feel under pressure to get this. But if you want it done right, then try this out. My only drawback is that it doesn\'t last the whole length of my day, even though the concentration is high. Still for now, I would only buy this if I had the money to spend on it. Otherwise I can still stick with what I already know.', ""A fragrance that I associate with smell of fresh cut grass. A little spicy in the beginning (cloves and pepper) under a bed of green and grassy vetiver. I am getting some nuances of bitter orange after the initial blast. At this point it smells a little minty and very fresh. After about 30 minutes, the blend settles to a green and bitter, slightly mentholated vetiver. The fragrance is slow to transform and in the dry down, VE meets a slight warmer woodier side. I was expecting to be blown away, to have a new vetiver reference, but it wasn't the case. Actually I have grown to like it quite a bit since my first wearing , but it's not extraordinary. The reason might be that I prefer the rootier and heavier vetivers. This one is too green, grassy, clean and subtle, but with an undeniable blend quality. I am being overly critic, but it's a very solid scent.  Scent: 8/10 Longevity: 7/10 Projection: 5/10"", 'Along with Heely\'s ""Vetiver Veritas"", this is definitely one of the truest incarnations of vetiver I\'ve come across. A sharp blast of bitter citrus and dry spice blend with a raw, rooty hazelnut-toned vetiver, that smells a bit like sticking your head into a new wardrobe yet to be sanded down. Great performance; It projects well for at least 6 hours on my skin. I think it\'s a clean, fresh, rugged scent that would suit most men, in particular 25+.', '@Mr Cornells ~ This fragrance lasted quite long (>8 hours) on my cooler than average skin with moderate sillage. As indicated in the photograph shown here in Fragrantica, the perfume volume is 8% in 96% alcohol so it should be an EDT. A side note, my bottle from 2013 does not have the perfume and alcohol volume indicated separately but simply says 88% volume; however, I do believe that it means the same thing.', ""Vetiver root has been used in perfumery since day one, but the eponymous masculine Vetivers fixate on it with a particular reverence. Vetiver isn‚Äôt simply the masculine equivalent of the feminine white floral. It‚Äôs become a ceremonial totem of male toiletry, ranking with the foug√®re as a masculine olfactory reference. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Big Three (Carven, Guerlain, Givenchy) boosted vetiver from a fixative and a basenote material to the center of the discussion. The Maculine Vetiver became safe harbor in the 1960s-1970s when the underpinnings of masculinity were up for discussion. More vetiver fragrances than you can shake a stick at followed. Some kept close to the scent of the vetiver root itself (eg. Maitre Parfumeur et Gantier Route du Vetiver, Etro Vetiver, Lalique Encre Noire) while others strayed a bit further, riffing on a particular quality of the root (Annick Goutal Vetiver‚Äôs salty iodine, Serge Lutens‚Äôs chocolate Vetiver Oriental, ELDO Fat Electrician‚Äôs plastic and vinyl.)  Vetiver Extraordinaire falls into the conservative camp of Vetiver perfumes and The Big Three are its specific predecessors. All four are sweeping, classical perfumes that balance broad splashes and nuanced choices. Malle and Ropion are too well-versed in composition and history not to have understood the importance of the Big Three, but they chose to rival them rather than to imitate them. Malle also takes advantage of the of the fetishism surrounding the material, and fumies dutifully cite the 25% of vetiver oil used in the composition. Ropion‚Äôs approach is to take vetiver to finishing school. After the dazzling citrus punch of the first sniff, he employs a swirling floral topnote to accentuate vetiver‚Äôs inherent thumping bass range. The liveliness of the topenotes have hints of lipstick and makeup and Vetiver Extraordinaire barely skirts the scandalous 'Old Lady Perfume' territory. The topnotes are ‚Äòperfumey‚Äô and remind me that Ropion known for his over-the-top perfumey feminine florals (Givenchy Amarige and Ysatis, Malle‚Äôs own Carnal Flower). Vetiver Extraordinaire eventually settles into a more traditionally masculine woody range, albeit with a dandy flourish.  Vetiver Extraordinaire captures the sensibility of the Fr√©d√©ric Malle line perfectly. It is a superlative contemporary spin on a traditional form. Though not nearly as ubiquitous, Vetiver Extraordinaire rivals Guerlain Vetiver as the standard-bearer of the genre among vetiver enthusiasts. from scenthurdle.com"", 'I have a thing for lean compositions. Take a key note such as the divine vetiver, acknowledge its angles and try to stress their character by adding minimal touches of notes sharing the same effect. Working this way we have experienced many fabulous vetiver compositions that highlight a certain facet of the root. However this is not the case for Vetiver Extraordinaire as this composition goes for something more challenging and adventurous. It goes for the whole effect, the whole root without emphasizing a particular element. Undertaking such task imagines impossible and the tuning can be embarrassing arduous even if you know exactly what you are doing. Miraculously Vetiver Extraordinaire strikes bull‚Äôs-eye and comes as close to the natural smell of vetiver as never before. The matter with other vetivers is this balance, which deliberately leans towards one or another aspect of the note. I wrote deliberately but VE made me think that more attentively. Perhaps this is more of a deliberate necessity for perfumers while identifying the difficulty to balance the accord to the center point and simulate the heart and soul of the material. If you love vetiver you simply can‚Äôt miss the phenomenal geometric symmetry of Vetiver Extraordinaire. This simply is the Everest of vetiver fragrances.', ""The name of this stuff already gives an idea of what comes after spraying, Vetiver Extraordinare have one of the bests vetiver's in the world of scents,I sincerely hoped that the vetiver note would be more pronounced at the base of this fragance, but not,after bergamot and orange in open,within seconds i feel come dry and woody waves than with to little bit of pink pepper help to giving a warmed , smoky and woody base,after hours,the base comes with sandalwood and cedar, which makes staying the woody aspect of the fragrance, however in the midst of so many woods at the base, appears a single touch of myrrh, sweetening the base and closing wonderfully this masterpiece scent.

The top-notes are a little distracting - an unnecessary ""fresh"" initial element, presumably the citrus - but they disperse swiftly leaving a clever and very sexy vetiver.  It appears to be a single note fragrance but in actual fact I suspect it is a very cunningly constructed raft of elements all combining to bring out the elements of the vetiver keynote. This is clearly a masculine scent, and vetiver is at it\'s best on a man\'s skin.

I love vetiver and i love Frederic Malle's perfumes, but the this was a loud headache inducer for me the first hours after applying one spray (the first five minutes it smells like sweat). After several hours though... the myrrh gets more pronounced and a beautiful powdery warm skin scent appears. If only it was like that at once!

I've tried this one over the years, and there's something lingering that I dislike. I'm not sure if it's the citrus playing in the background, or whether it might be the musty aspects. If someone were to ask me what VE is closest to, I would probably say Sycomore, which I also can't love. So, whatever it is they share is likely the culprit. Although, Sycomore is sweet and VE is dry, there is something in both that I don't like, but between the two I prefer this one. Hopefully, as I wear more of my decant, I can try to figure this one out more. I get slightly better than average projection and very good longevity. My rating for now, is 7.6"", 'This is a very good vetiver fragrance, but not a great one to me. I was expecting great at this price point. Even by the drydown I only detect the vetiver, begamot and pink pepper notes. This is not a bad combo, just wish some of the other notes listed were more noticeable. Longevity and sillage were just ok.', ""Ugly on a woman, eh? Apparently the estrogen leaped out of my pores and did some sort of chemical wizardry because what's on my arm right now makes me smell like I've been rolling around in a dewy meadow. I may have to buy this for myself. It's fresh without being soapy or combative. It smells like the fresh air of a place I want to be. If I were to advertise this for a woman she'd be the hot chick in the hiking boots with wild hair blowing in the wind on a mountain side. I wouldn't wear it in high heels."", ""In my opinion Vetiver Extraordinaire is one of the best from Malle's line, not because it trumps anything else per say, but because unlike others it fizzes and seems to come alive on skin. This is an effervescent vetiver, buoyed by bergamot, neroli, and pink pepper for a fresh and vaguely soapy affect. Vetiver root comprises the spine, but Ropion utilized cedar, saffron, and musk to keep it from becoming too dry and flat like Guerlain's Vetiver. I'm not sure if Safraleine or something similar to safranal was used here, but the mellow spiciness in VE's heart suggests high ingredient quality was employed at a generous dosage, perhaps more than usual. If you like Creed's Vetiver, Original Vetiver, Guerlain Vetiver, and Encre Noire, but want something even crisper, spicier, and more direct, Vetiver Extraordinaire should be on your short list."", ""Wearing this today on a very hot and humid summer day I do love the intense vetiver, probably the best I've tried so far. It sits perfectly on my skin in the heat. Lovely dry down. My only complaint is the short life of the scent, 3 sprays gone completely in less than 3 hours."", ""Of the many vetiver fragrances I have tried, I would guess that this is the truest to the actual scent of vetiver.  There is a brightness and freshness and green/'grassy' quality, perhaps partly due to a subtle citrus note, but also the roots are very evident, giving it a slightly earthy/rootsy quality, but not in a bad way at all. It is just not 'softened' by any real hint of sweetness. In terms of wine I would describe it as really 'dry'. Maybe it should be named 'Just Vetiver'  It has excellent longevity and reasonable projection or sillage. To my mind, it is neither masculine or feminine, and it will not be liked by all, but if you like vetiver, then that is what it truly is.... plain and simple.....or at least to my nose.  The white musk in the base, a note I do not normally enjoy, because of its presence in so many mainstream designer fragrances, is not really evident but probably serves to simply enhance the vetiver. I like it, but I do not love it.  Sycamore with the subtle sandalwood base...or Route de Vetiver softened with the subtle fruity note are preferable for me...but this is the real deal..love it or it hate it...real vetiver..grass, roots and all Update - 03.10.14 - With time I have come to realise that this is a masterpiece of blending. Altough this seems a 'soliflore', in fact that is an illusion. Dominique Ropion seems to have created a vivid and bright 'true' vetiver scent, partly by complementing vetiver with a whole series of notes which are not individually identifiable to most noses. However, each note accents a facet of the vetiver to create perfume 'magic'."", ""smells like repairning cars or motorbikes in your garage. (in a good way) One of the best vetivers i've tried."", 'As I\'ve said in my previous reviews, I cannot do the ""it smells like tree bark, with a hint of vegetable, drying to shake n vac"" thing. But what I can tell you is this is one of the most fabulous fragrances I have ever put on myself, and it\'s fabulous from the first touch on the skin. I have French Lover, and would cut off your arm for it, but this tops it. I got a sample and the first time I wore It 3 women immediately asked me what I was wearing and said they loved it. They ranged in age from 21 to 51. Even 2 of my male friends noticed it and were very positive. Get yourself a sample from somewhere. This truly is a wonderful fragrance. I am waiting for my bottle to arrive. I hate the waiting!', 'Stark, acrid and unforgiving. This is not the warm vetiver of Sycomore, or Route de Vetiver, or even the dark Encre Noire. The fragrance this most reminds me of is the camphorous Hinoki by CdG. Sharp and monolithic. Distinctive....yes, but not very wearable.', ""Might be better on men as rule, but it's better on me than my SO, therefore, I will be keeping this dry, peppery lovely sample for myself. And in my fantasy world where I can buy bottles whenever I want...."", ""Tried Sycomore, tried Encre Noire, tried Guerlain's Vetiver, tried Creed's, tried Hermes Vetiver Tonka... But VE is the best! Guerlain is too soapy fresh, with an old man's feel. Creed is less soapy but has a similar vibe; an innocent vetiver. Herme's is sickly sweet. Hazelnut mixed with vetiver. Imagine dropping the vetiver into a saucepan of syrup and trying ever so hard to separate the two. Sycomore and Encre are similar. But with Encre being darker and bitter, picture Spiderman putting on the Venom suit, corrupted, evil, put still somewhat cool. Both are vetivers dominated by warm woody notes. Imagine the vetiver root pulled out of a forest with the wind catching the smell of a tree truck. Very rustic. Malle's VE doesn't rely on the roots of the vetiver to maintain its masculine edge, but rather the fresh citrus blended with the sharpest green vetiver I have ever come across. As sharp as a razor blade I would say. The ozone notes lightens the scent but also tingles your senses every time VE catches a whiff of the air; sharp green vetiver attacks your senses reminding you of the incisiveness of this vetiver, just when you thought it is gone. A great juxtaposition between lightness (ozone note) and incisiveness without relying on heavy woods (rustic) to depict manliness. Perfect for a classy gentlemen with a mean streak. The greenish, airiness, sharpness, and mossiness of VE makes this one a very unique take on vetiver I must say. Yes, it is more linear than the Sycomores or Encre Noires... But only because it is the purest take on the vetiver note that I have so far come across. Great for Spring and Summer for me! Perfect! Too bad vetiver fragrances in general have only average longevity, 6 to 10 (pushing it) hours"", 'Well, this is the apotheosis of the ""masculine vetiver fragrance"" concept! A SUBLIME composition that immediately jumps at the top of its genre together with other masterpieces such as Sycomore, Route Du Vetiver and the Givenchy\'s. Vetiver Extraordinaire is a stark and edgy composition where the usual bergamot/citrus opening is dried to the bone by sharp woody notes and a massive dose of dry vetiver. Add a nice (and slight) quasi-soapy twist and here\'s a masterpiece. Good sillage and excellent lasting power. One of my favourites. Rating: 9.5/10', ""Attention all men. If you notice youre being followed by a skinny brown haired girl and youre wearing this perfume chances are that it's me. But don't worry, I'm harmless. MAN this is good! Best vetiver ever. This is so rooty, smoky, sofisticated, sexy as hell... I could go on and on and on.  Women can also wear this. Hell I wish everyone wore this!"", 'The name for Frederic Malle Vetiver Extraordinaire is no hyperbole - this is an extraordinary and unique vetiver, and I have tried a LOT of vetivers. Much has been written about how much vetiver there is in this (taken from the official Malle notes, which emphasize the point), but this is misleading. I love vetiver and have several different essential oils from various locations (they are fairly different from each other). Yes, there is a lot of vetiver in Vetiver Extraordinaire, but it is either an artfully blended vetiver or Ropion got his hands on a vetiver oil unlike any I have smelled. The top and middle have a good dose of dark bitter orange peel and plenty of pink pepper and I suspect something else that I can\'t figure out, maybe it is the clove but it is so blended I can\'t pick it out. I wonder if there isn\'t a big dose of Safraleine in there (warm leather saffron tobacco sweet woody). The blended effect is hard to describe because it is so distinctive and unique - this is unlike any other vetiver perfume I have smelled (note added later - Terre d\'Hermes is somewhat similar). Spicy, earthy, warm, leathery, dark green, with the grassy-rooty-smoky notes of most vetivers muted. The scent changes relatively little and only very slowly with time, getting more wood and myrrh notes in the base. Regardless of the analysis, Vetiver Extraordinaire is indeed a sublime take on this classic essential oil. I am leery of perfumes at this price point, suspecting the price to have more with making them ""exclusive"" than with their quality (in most cases I think this cynical view is correct - these are called Veblen good in economics). But VE is an exception - it is indeed extraordinary and I suppose you have to expect to pay for that.', 'Okay just hear me out,  I live in Malaysia, oil palm trees are something quite common here, a big industry here. Second biggest producer after Indonesia, our big neighbour. I work in this industry for several years now. Did you know that oil palm produce both male and female inflorescences? yesss. The male produced pollen while the female will developed into fruit bunches after cross pollination happened. The male inflorescences at some time in its life cycle will matured up and begin an anthesis stage. In which during this time it released pollen, the flower will turn golden yellow and it produced a really really nice scent. Cant describe the smell but it is really nice. when you walk in the field you can detect the smell whenever it is close by.  So I always wonder, if only there is a fragrance that smell like this. A vetiver lover myself, I owned Nishane Sultan Vetiver, Roja Vetiver Parfum Cologne, Encre Noir and some others, constantly trying out vetiver centric scent out there. Until this one pop up in one of my favourite youtube fragrance reviewer, took the liberty of buying a tester vial for this. It is not cheap, blind buy would be a risky thing. Had to test before pulling any trigger Tested it and boom! this smell exactly like the oil palm male inflorescences!! finally there is one fragrance that smell like it! this is unique, i guess it came from this beautiful blend between cloves and vetiver. Dominique Ropion is a genius! this is a masterpiece, this is art. This is what I am looking for. A fragrance that smell like oil palm male flowers. I loved it. Gonna get this one day soon.', 'I‚Äôm sorry for being the bearer of bad news but this fragrance is a total waste of money  Just because they are using a slightly better quality Vetiver doesn‚Äôt suffice the price tag they are asking for  Almost the same as every other generic Vetiver based scent it is completely forgettable if you are willing to pay the price go try French lover ‚Ä¶.. now that is a Vetiver based fragrance worth checking out', 'Stark, acrid and unforgiving. This is not the warm vetiver of Sycomore, or Route de Vetiver, or even the dark Encre Noire. The fragrance this most reminds me of is the camphorous Hinoki by CdG. Sharp and monolithic. Distinctive....yes, but not very wearable.', 'I think this one is awful. The opening is pretty nice, but on my skin, the drydown goes into a smokey vetiver (which I like) and a mix of musk, pink peppercorn and cumin which smell somewhat like body odor. That body odor scent keeps lingering with tremendous longevity which is not good. The reason I shower, groom and use fragrance is to smell clean and attractive. This seems to work in the exact opposite direction, so I am giving this a wide berth.', 'I straight up dislike this, it reminds me Encre Noir with a rubber note. I had to wash this off as it nearly made me wretch. Definitely for an old man, not my type unfortunately', 'The vetiver smells nice and true to form. I understand the love, but for me the opening seems a bit sour, the mid a little stuffy, and the drydown a bit beige. But that‚Äôs from someone who likes more lift in a fragrance, quite simply. To me this is extremely similar to guerlain vetiver extreme. Extremely similar (hint).']"

It smells so damn good ‚Äî smooth, airy, and masterfully blended ‚Äî but it barely lasts. And honestly, I don‚Äôt care. I still wear it all the time, because when it‚Äôs on, it‚Äôs one of the best-smelling fragrances I own. It makes me feel clean in a way that doesn‚Äôt smell basic, fresh in a way that isn‚Äôt boring, and somehow refined without even trying. I do wish it lasted longer, but for the time it does linger, it‚Äôs genuinely beautiful. At first spray, it‚Äôs an airy blend of bright peony and earthy vetiver, softened by a gentle plum note that adds just enough fruit without ever veering into sweetness. The peony and vetiver create a beautiful, ‚Äúcrunchy‚Äù contrast, and the plum is a soft bridge that smoothes everything out and ties it all together. The incense is there too, contributing to the contrast between depth and brightness, but it's subtle. Dia doesn‚Äôt lean heavy, smoky, or spicy like a typical Amouage might. Instead, it plays in the space between light florals, dry woods, and clean musky skin, blending everything so seamlessly it‚Äôs hard to pick out where one note ends and the next begins. And that‚Äôs where the magic is. This isn‚Äôt one of those ‚Äúwow‚Äù scents that punches you in the face and demands your attention. It‚Äôs a slow burn. It feels like slipping into a pressed white shirt still warm from the sun, walking past blooming trees on a crisp spring morning. It smells like someone who knows they have nothing to prove. The drydown floats between orris and vetiver, with touches of rosewood and labdanum humming in the background. This is the kind of scent you wear for yourself ‚Äî the way niche fragrances are meant to be ‚Äî not for compliments. But if someone does get close enough, they‚Äôll definitely lean in a little more. The performance leaves a lot to be desired. A quick glance through the reviews and it‚Äôs clear: projection is minimal, and it tends to stay close to the skin. You‚Äôll get a few solid hours of gentle projection before it sits so close to the skin you‚Äôll wonder if you even sprayed it that morning. But that‚Äôs not enough to stop it from being one of my favorite fragrances of all time. Would I love if this had the power of Interlude or the longevity of Jubilation 40? Of course. But that softness is part of Dia‚Äôs charm. It doesn‚Äôt try to last forever. It gives you a moment of peace, beauty, and subtle grace. And in this case, that‚Äôs more than enough. Dia Man isn‚Äôt the loudest, longest-lasting, or most ‚ÄúAmouage‚Äù Amouage, but it might just be one of the most special. If you can live with its quiet nature, you‚Äôll find yourself reaching for it again and again. Not because you want to impress anyone‚Ä¶ but because it feels like home. Scent (on skin): 8.5/10 Scent (sillage): 9.5/10 Projection: 3/10 Longevity: 4.5/10 Value: 3/10 Originality: 8.5/10 Mass appeal: 8/10 Versatility: 8.5/10"", 'Clean, soapy, inoffensive, all year round Amouage. The problem with this is after 2-3 hours it become very close to the skin.', 'Happiness in a bottle. All year all occasions Amouage.  Unlike others experienced, on my skin (which is usually a perfume graveyard) longevity is good with moderate silage which is perfect for Dia.  It‚Äôs on the same page as Jubilation XXV for me.  I have a recent batch.', 'Excellent scent but a week performance unfortunately', 'Props to those who are in love with real peony and lotus flower, and adores the scent of purity, and innocent vibes.  Art imitates life. Peony scent cannot be extracted from the flower. Dia Man is probably the greatest imitation of the real thing.  It is soft, subtle, and slightly green. Yes, it is giving off soapy vibes, but if you know the smell of peony by heart, this is very realistic. Each note in the bottle is a supportive artery to the heart (peony). The soft-fresh floral effect starts introducing the earthiness of grassy vetiver in about 30-45 minutes.  Then at the drydown, it has this LIGHT salty-sour woody scent that is present in Lorenzo Villoresi Theseus and in Terre D‚Äôhermes.  To feel that it is worthy, you have to be okay to wear perfumes mainly for yourself and for the love of peony.  Even the performance behaves like the flower. SUBTLE.', ""This fragrance is so bittersweet to me because the blend is masterful as most Amouages tend to be, the complexity of the notes used is so unique and there's truly nothing like this on the market that smells like this and this fragrance is a true blend of French and Middle Eastern perfumery. French perfumery like French food is all about the ingredients or notes playing in perfect harmony with each other to create a concoction that smells ethereal which this does, while Middle Eastern perfumery is about creating 'waves' where you smell each phase of the fragrance separately throughout the wear time. This magically manages to do both. The notes play off each other to create a symphony of olfactory bliss where everything together creates a very poised, regal and luxury feel yet at the same time you can smell the prominent notes and individually pick them out the way you can in Middle Eastern perfumery.  The smell itself is very nostalgic because it smells like numerous different fragrances (the incense reminds me a lot of the incense note in Tiger's Nest by Memo), the plum note is the closest plum I have smelled in any other fragrance to Tom Ford's Plum Japonais and the frankincense is very slightly animalic, very syrupy and amber like - quintessential Amouage. It opens with a lot of 'sweet incense' without it being too overpowering or smoky where you feel like you're being choked out, I personally didn't get much cardamom on skin but others around me said they could smell it albeit it was very faint to them too, I did however get a very slight citrus smell in the opening to balance out the sweetness of the incense.  The mid notes have a prominent plum note and a very light floral aspect to them, if I hadn't seen the note breakdown I wouldn't have been able to tell you it was peony. It smells floral but not like white florals although not like rose either so perhaps 'peony' is then the go-to foral note when it doesn't fit under the rose or white flowers umbrella. It smells like when the wind is lightly floral as you walk by flowering bushes and trees in a park.  On skin I don't get much wood or leather either, I do however get a very slightly animalic frankincense note (which is not listed in the breakdown) but it is unmistakably frankincense and not something else. Don't get much patchouli or vetiver either. I mostly get amber, frankincense and a very dry 'grassy' like smell which I suppose is the vetiver but it's not like a traditional green vetiver note. It smells like super dry, brown grass or almost like hay.  The smell is gorgeous I just wished it lasted longer. This thing is blended like an Amouage, it smells like a work of art as most Amouages do but on skin it lasts no longer than maybe 30 minutes on my skin. Amouage smell and blending with Acqua Di Parma/Jo Malone performance. I hope Amouage strengthen this fragrance because it's a better all weather scent than Reflection in my opinion. So light you could wear 20 sprays on an airplane and within an hour most people would have no idea you have anything on - hence the reason for my 'Ok' rating.

I just wanted to say that I 100% disagree with @Chess53 and at the same time I 100% agree with him :D What I disagree about is the rating - I am 36 and I love this fragrance. I find it very versatile and while it might seem old fashioned and similar to the stuff from the 80\'s - to me this is a perfectly blended, timeless classic. It\'s fresh, floral, woody and earthy all at the same time. Maybe it\'s not something that stands out a lot, maybe not something that makes people say ""wow"" when they smell it for the first time. But for me it\'s a 10/10, perfect signature scent. But I\'m not saying that just to argue with someone or make you change your mind, it\'s highly subjective and everyone has their own taste. One man\'s trash is another man\'s treasure :) And this is where we come to the part where I 100% agree - always test, never fully trust reviews online.

Nothing mind-blowing and so the price even on online discounters is definitely too much. I think you can find cheaper scents that offer a similar profile or serve a similar purpose (e.g. Acqua Di Parma Colonia Intensa has a similar feel to this fragrance except that it has a citrus opening and middle rather than a floral one)."", 'Smelling this from a vial sample on the back of my hand. In the search to try and find safer non church like heavy incense non-dense beast mode Amouages.... what comes to mind is Reflection man, Reflection 45 ( both EXCELLENT) and I researched more from the house. One name that came up was this fragrance Dia Man.  I agree with most of you who have said or use these words ""mature old man fragrance."" It\'s not to be malicious or derogatory. It\'s the exact smell. I\'m 53. I wouldn\'t wear this now. I would not wear this at 63. I wouldn\'t wear it at 73. Just not for me. It reminds me of my Dad\'s colognes that he used to wear that have that aftershave old Manish smell. It\'s unmistakable. You\'ll see for yourself if you try this sample. I would hate to throw this sample in the garbage, but I\'m not going to wear it. The good news? It\'s only a vial sample. Again to all beginners, go crazy with vial samples. Don\'t Blind buy. I will not give up on this house. I have Epic Man as we speak on the table. I tried it the other day it\'s not bad I have to wear it more. There are at least a handful of great scents from this house. Don\'t give up on Amouage if your new to this house. Sooner or later they\'ll hit a home run that you like.

In order to truly enjoy this, you have to avoid any mental associations to it being an ""old man"" scent. I had to rethink this myself, as it immediately reminded me of this old Vitalis hair tonic that my dad wore growing up. Once you move past that, you\'ll see that this is a classy, refined, professional scent, albeit a bit dated. Dia Man opens with mostly vetiver and peony accompanied by bitter orange. Some smokiness, labdanum, and woods eventually find their way in there, as well as a bit of powder. The vetiver and florals tend to stick around throughout the life of the fragrance. This is a mature masculine all the way.', 'Honestly, I was expecting worse from this. I say such a thing due to the fact that Amouage as a house so far has been rather odd to my nose. To be honest this is rather pleasant, its woody, sweet, floral and elegant. Not overbearing in any capacity, not too masculine, not too feminine either but rather a good combination. Its soft and attention grabbing due to it not being a traditional fragrance. I do truly like this one, worth buying but maybe so at a later date. As im smelling this, it kind of reminds me of my grandparents bathroom (not in a chemical manner but rather a wood cabinet with remnants of cleaning supply etched into the layers of the wood) at their old house, but not necessarily in a bad way, has a nostalgic nuance to it, at least to me personally.', 'This is like a proto-Timbuktu from L\'Artisan, here you have incense with peony+plum making a sort of ""mango"" note that is in Timbuktu. This is complex and elegant, very clean and a soft side of masculinity is displayed in this creation. Yet at the same time it is very interesting, you will see how many details this has actually. Brilliant. This along with Beach Hut, Reflection and Beloved Man shows that Amouage can go away from their heavy ambers and incense, and give us a different style that doesnt go away from their DNA.', '9/10 Gentlemen fragrance.', 'A nice smelling perfume. Like you‚Äôll literally think of a nice person when you smell this. It‚Äôs got great projection but it‚Äôs soft at the same time. Never overwhelms your nose. It starts off a little bright and soapy clean thanks to the citrus and vetiver but It‚Äôs mostly powdery, comforting and warm probably thanks to the amber and labdanum. Kinda reminds me of Terre D Hermes with the way the vetiver is used but just take away all the citrus from that and just leave the dry down part of it. It‚Äôs got a floral tinge to the powdery character which is probably the peony as it‚Äôs on of the main notes in this perfume for me and if you get closer, you can get a nice smooth smoky tone in there too but it‚Äôs mostly powdery on me. Got good longevity one me but it‚Äôs an Amouage so I expected that. Really nice perfume.', ""A very different Amouage from what you would expect. Dia Man is elegant, restrained, professional, understated, and has a silent confidence about it. The Peony note smells exactly like putting your nose to a Peony flower. Peony flowers aren't very fragrant and you have to put your nose very close, almost inside of the flower, to smell them. That is how this fragrance behaves. The florals combined with the vetiver and plum give it a woody sweetness that is beautifully balanced. This would be an awesome office scent. Spray more than you typically would and absolutely spray on clothing and you'll get whiffs often."", ""Straight off the bat, smells like handwash. That's really the only way to put it. Very much like a handwash or soap found at a nice resort or hotel. I was expecting the dry-down to drastically change the smell but I was dead wrong. Would not purchase a bottle of this especially considering the extortionate price (in my opinion)."", ""An incredible vetiver scent with better performance than it first seems.... I'm not a huge Bertie fan but this one is wonderful, and it doesn't smell like Guerlain Vetiver any more than any one vetiver scent smells like another. In fact I'd say this one is a lot more original than most. Perfect for a rainy, cold autumn day, to add a sparkle and shimmer to the grim, grey surroundings. Today it's raining constantly I Paris and I'm out and about, and this little gem is giving me a spritz of joy as I go between my meetings."", '#942 in my ""Tour de Fragrance"" An Amouage scent I would absolutely love if it performed better. Though I actually like the incense note in this enough that I almost don\'t care. Almost. It\'s half the price of Amouage ""Enclave"", my favorite from Amouage, but it\'s also half the sillage and longevity. You\'ll definitely need to reapply this at lunch as it\'s at the very low end of EDP potency. And you can get a pretty dead on clone of this from Fragrenza called ""Intimate Peony"" for $63. In it\'s favor it\'s an interesting and complex scent that I think is fine for any purpose in any setting involving a short engagement. As with most incense scents I\'d save it for cooler weather. This won\'t take the heat. I think it\'s car pool, elevator and tight office safe, but I\'d probably rely on this as a date night fragrance. If something hasn\'t happened in the three-fours before it becomes all but indetectable it probably isn\'t going to.', 'This is a wonderful mature fragrance that checks all of the boxes for a formal business scent and or a semi dressed up casual scent.

It sort of surprises me that it‚Äôs an Amouage & has me scratching my head why Bracken was axed & this one still remains?‚Ä¶The freshness or somewhat powdery feel of this one pretty much later on moves into the fougure territory, And I detect the addiction of leather in the dry down. Honestly reminds me of all those different Old Spice Body Sprays seems like damn near a hundred of them to choose from in a big grocery store or Walmart. I would never think that an Amouage would ever put a picture of a young man in my head wearing Rock Revival Jeans with all the rhinestones on the ass pockets with a western shirt & cowboy boots And all the mousse in his head is giving me a headache behind him in the checkout line! But it isn‚Äôt the perfume filled mousse. No it‚Äôs Dia Man that he took a bath in!

Gorgeous fragrance that I'd wear anytime, anywhere. One of those rare perfumes that is less a fragrance and more of an aura. The only fragrance it somewhat reminds me of is Zaharoff Signature. It shares many characteristics, although they are highly distinguishable. Zaharoff Signature is drier, less sweet, is not particularly floral to my nose, and is more noticably spicy, primarily due to its black pepper. That's a fragrance I enjoy and consider a strong signature, although its dry spiciness does fatigue me for daily wear. Dia Man is on another level for me, both in terms of appeal and wearability.  If you sample this one and it isn't a love at first sniff, please give it a few wears. I did not love it initially, but it has quickly become one of my top 5 fragrances and is my current signature scent. It may take a while before Dia Man reveals its complexity and unique appeal and wins you over."", ""I've been wanting this for a while and finally pulled the trigger. My 9th Amouage. It's definitely a good one. I would say 30 yo+. Classy scent. It seems subtle because it's not super sweet, powdery, or has enough incense to be comparable to Interlude. Good for 70 degrees+, or in the office. Signature scent worthy. 6+ hours, arms length projection. It has some Jubilation vibes. A little dirty, a little sweet, a little clean."", ""Lovely smoky vetiver that's contrasted by soapy pink florals. Mediocre performance"", 'This one worked really well for me. From a generous sample and three days of wear over 3 weeks I got 8+ hours of length each day with great projection throughout. Citrus and white floral opening. Complex with some spiciness. Really lovely. Vetiver comes about 30 minutes in. Very soft and green. Woody dry down is warm, rich but not overwhelming. Lovely scent. Well complimented at office. Certainly worthy of FB consideration.', 'I have a bottle of this available for swap. Pre-reformulation.', ""I don't understand why so many comments emphasise that DIA is masculine... Gentle, soft, delicate, creamy (i mean the nivea cream vibe)...  If that is masculinity it has to be a man in pink sweater, slim jeans and with purse, which he has to carry to be a good boy for his lady. Yuck. Anyway it is nice floral, pleasant scent. Creaminess which you can find in Guerlain Habit Rouge after dry down. Amouage quality. Worth to check."", 'Olfactory interpretation of elegance.

Perfectly unisex. Not the best performance though.', 'It is a very beautiful,non offensive,classy and old money style. It has a very good longevity but projection is very close to skin and that is not a bad thing. The people that are allowed to come close can smell the nice aura aroynd you.

I wore it as my scent of the day and applied liberally before heading to work. The first couple of hours were fairly enjoyable. The fragrance is powdery, floral, soft and pretty. Unfortunately, by hour five the fragrance had all but disappeared. Dia is non-offensive and works well in an office setting. However, a midday re-application will be necessary. One of the weaker fragrances in my collection.', ""It smells very smooth, hard to pick out any single notes. For some reason it reminds me of the older stuff like Boss Number One but it's way softer and doesn't have that urinal cake vibe if you know what I mean... A bit of sweetness, some flowers, spices and wood - perfectly balanced for my taste. It's quite classy but at the same very versatile, good for any occasion or time of year/day.  Not a safe buy though, if you're a younger guy or more into the modern fragrances, this might not be for you. The only bad thing I have to say about this is the performance. Got my 100ml bottle for ~150eur which is a very good price for Amouage but considering that the sillage is so weak and it lasts maybe for 3 hours, I still feel like I paid too much."", 'This is to me is one of the least Amouage like fragrances. It‚Äôs neutered and pretty underwhelming (even for a standard designer fragrance). For a vetiver fragrance, you can do much better with the Encre Noire series than with this one. It does not last or project. The scent dna is ok but nothing to impress.  Also, I struggle to find the imaginary peony accord thats supposed to be available here.  I am a big amouage fan and so far I have 8 bottles from the house and to me this does not behave or feel like an amouage. Edit: After further testing, my initial thoughts are still intact about Dia. I get a woody feel through and through but it does not have any wow factor. It is a 1 - dimensional fragrance. There are many fragrances that does vetiver better than this one.', 'Quick notes: Dry down vetiver is very similar to guerlain Vetiver.', 'Smells like the barber shop, but in a nice mature elegant way.

Please feel free to DM me.', ""This is an exceptional perfume. Deep and top notch quality. Personaly I would not wear it anywhere outside my house though. Very difficult to pull this off, as mentioned by others before me, especialy if you are under 50 years old.  It is office safe only in the sense that it's not a projection monster, otherwise it is not even remotely a scent someone would expect to smell in an office or other professional enviroment. For me it is not suitable for day wear either. From time to time it gives me vibes of Chanel no5 or similar very mature lady scents. Overall it is a great perfume but just not my cup of tea. I can enjoy and apreciate it nevertheless."", 'This is my second bottle of D√≠a Man, I previously purchased a 100ml bottle based on numerous recommendations, but ended up selling it as I couldn‚Äôt make up my mind whether or not I liked it. Last week I bought a 50ml and here are some thoughts: - It smells mature and not in a good way, a timeless classic this is not. This opens sweet (sweet orange, honey plum), but along side the sweetness there is a spiciness that balances it out. - The sweetness isn‚Äôt cloying or synthetic, there are tons of high quality naturals here. This is a riff on French perfumery from the 70s, very elegant and clean, not too loud.  - Dries down to Vetiver and leather with a spicy overtone and a mild sweetness. There are layers and details in the fragrance, but this is not an easy wear. I kept hearing that this is super versatile and office safe, but unless your office is located at Roja Dove‚Äôs marketing headquarters, I don‚Äôt see how anyone under the age of 65 can pull this off with a straight face.', 'Got a new batch and it doesn‚Äôt work on my skin. Didn‚Äôt find it to project extremely well and it just smells like the soap you would find in a gas station bathroom. Really a shame based on the reviews I read on older batches!', ""I was wearing this about 10 years ago. It had a deep, warm, floral incense-y aura that lasted quite a few hours with a reasonable sillage. It was my office scent, very discreet, calm and elegant.  A few years later I got hold of an official Amouage sample and I was shocked by how different, soapy, light, lavender-like shaving foam it smelled. I visited Amouage's store in London and my suspicion was confirmed, this has been reformulated. When I asked the sales assistants they wouldn't give me a straight answer. Nonetheless, I still had some juice left in the old bottle and compared it to their latest sample - this is no longer the perfume it used to be. They pretty much killed it. What a shame... and a hard pass."", ""The perfect gift for CEOs! If you're  into classy scent , classic elegant woody fragrances check this one."", 'Depending on my mood, this fragrance often takes the lead among my Amouage favorites, alongside Reflection Man and Imitation Man. Though not typically described as a young man‚Äôs scent, it surprisingly works for me, evoking memories of my younger, more innocent days when I relished the scent of my dad‚Äôs favorite shaving foam. Official notes won‚Äôt reveal this nostalgic aroma, and it took me a while to pinpoint it. My best guess is the combination of the iris (orris root) and an unmentioned lavender note. TOP NOTES What I get is this wonderful combination of zesty but not bitter orange, combined with the most realistic peony flower. Both modern and traditional which is hard to accomplish. I do not detect the leathery labdanum throughout the composition along with cardamom which are probably here as supporting notes. HEART NOTES The elegant dance of fragrant notes continues into the middle stage, introducing lavender and iris. Orris, derived from the iris root, adds a powdery, and slightly soapy barbershop elegance that enhances the fragrance‚Äôs depth. While plum is often touted as a dominant note, in my case, it‚Äôs almost non-detectable. Living in a region abundant with plums, I can confidently say not to expect much plum presence. BASE NOTES In the drydown, Omani frankincense stands out like no other ‚Äî the best in the world, with nothing else even coming close. How the perfumer made it elegant and just right without being overpowering is a feat in itself. Vetiver, another key player in the base, contributes a smooth and woody character, grounding the fragrance with depth, accompanied by the subtlest rose I‚Äôve encountered. Dia was designed to be an entire experience, not just a scent where you detect a couple of prominent notes and call it a day. OVERALL A fragrance exuding nuanced sophistication, Dia stands as an underrated gem seldom discussed in contemporary fragrance discourse. In my perspective, Dia not only stands out but also offers commendable value within its mostly unique scent DNA. Considered a masterpiece by my standards, Dia remains a scent that warrants sampling before a full commitment, despite being a staple in my collection and aligning with my personal preferences and priorities. Read the full review at scentgrail.com', ""Super weak, watered down. Abysmally soft. I'm talking minutes here. Spray and poof just disappears. I believe that's on the current batches that are coming out ofcourse. This version doesn't even allow you to get a glimpse of what this could've smelled like when it first came out. Never had such an experience with this house, most of the others that I've tried are undoubtedly great performers. Anyway, what has to be noted is that the nose behind this, Bertrand Duchaufour, is someone that's made stunning, complex and complete fragrances over the years and deserves all the respect he gets. However Dia Man broke my high expectations, and I would love to believe that it's a one off out of all the others in his portfolio. To try and describe this from it's short fleeting lifespan, it's a faint blend of spiced fresh bitter orange with cumin type of accord, incense and masculinely done florals with thin woodsy vetiver, that is what I get, DNA reminiscent of YSL Kouros. If you can try to breathe in a moment of that, and have high regard for the house of Amouage, then please go ahead and try for yourself. 6/10"", 'How can you tell if the bottle is vintage ?

Amouage Dia Man: Un Viaggio Olfattivo senza Paragoni All‚Äôapertura della scatola di Amouage Dia Man, non si pu√≤ fare a meno di notare l‚Äôeleganza pura che promette. E con la prima inalazione, si avverte immediatamente che questa promessa √® stata mantenuta. La fragranza si apre con un‚Äôaccattivante mistura di Incenso e Cardamomo, che evoca un senso di mistero e avventura. Questo viene ulteriormente esaltato dalle note di Labdano e Arancia Amara, che aggiungono un tocco di freschezza vibrante e un sottile pizzico di agrume. Mentre la fragranza si sviluppa, emergono le note di cuore, con la delicata Peonia e la dolcezza succulenta della Prugna, che fanno da contrasto al terroso Rizoma di Iris e all‚Äôopulento Ylang Ylang. Questo bouquet floreale e fruttato crea una sensazione di lusso senza pari, come passeggiare in un giardino mediterraneo al tramonto. E come ogni grande storia ha un finale indimenticabile, anche Dia Man non delude. Le note di fondo sono un trionfo di profondit√† e carattere. Il Vetiver e il Legno di Rosa Brasiliano offrono una base legnosa, mentre l‚ÄôAmbra e il Patchouli aggiungono calore e persistenza. Il tocco finale di Cuoio conferisce un senso di mascolinit√† raffinata. Amouage Dia Man √®, senza dubbio, una fragranza per chi apprezza l‚Äôarte della profumeria. Un tributo all‚Äôeleganza, alla complessit√† e alla bellezza delle essenze pi√π pregiate. Quando lo indossi, non sei solo avvolto da un profumo, ma vivi una vera e propria esperienza e anche se questo profumo √® stato creato pi√π di 20 anni fa, il suo fascino non √® affatto diminuito. Al contrario, come un vino pregiato che migliora con gli anni, Amouage Dia Man ha acquisito una maturit√† che intensifica la sua innata eleganza e sofisticatezza. La sua longevit√† nel mondo della profumeria testimonia non solo la maestria con cui √® stato creato, ma anche la sua capacit√† di affascinare e sedurre generazione dopo generazione.

Amouage Dia Man: An Unparalleled Olfactory Journey Upon opening the box of Amouage Dia Man, one can‚Äôt help but notice the sheer elegance it promises. And with the first inhalation, it becomes immediately evident that this promise has been fulfilled. The fragrance opens with an alluring blend of Frankincense and Cardamom, evoking a sense of mystery and adventure. This is further enhanced by notes of Labdanum and Bitter Orange, adding a touch of vibrant freshness and a subtle hint of citrus. As the fragrance unfolds, the heart notes emerge, with the delicate Peony and the succulent sweetness of Plum contrasting the earthy Orris Root and the opulent Ylang Ylang. This floral and fruity bouquet creates a sense of unparalleled luxury, like walking through a Mediterranean garden at sunset. And as every great story has an unforgettable ending, Dia Man does not disappoint. The base notes are a triumph of depth and character. Vetiver and Brazilian Rosewood provide a woody foundation, while Amber and Patchouli add warmth and longevity. The final touch of Leather imparts a sense of refined masculinity. Amouage Dia Man is, without a doubt, a fragrance for those who appreciate the art of perfumery. A tribute to elegance, complexity, and the beauty of the finest essences. When you wear it, you‚Äôre not just enveloped in a scent, but you‚Äôre living a true experience. And even though this perfume was created over 20 years ago, its allure has not diminished in the slightest. On the contrary, like a fine wine that improves with age, Amouage Dia Man has acquired a maturity that intensifies its innate elegance and sophistication. Its longevity in the world of perfumery attests not only to the mastery with which it was created but also its ability to enchant and seduce generation after generation. Wearing Dia Man today is like forming a bond with a rich and lush past, yet feeling modern, relevant, and always in the spotlight. Ultimately, it‚Äôs proof that true beauty and art are timeless.', ""This perfume blends so well that it's difficult to pick one note. It's the utmost refinement of floral and woody notes. The dry-down is soapy and slightly powdery. The man who wears this fragrance is friendly, and kind.  8/10"", ""Horribly reformulated. I've survived off of older carded samples for years and just recently purchased a newer bottle (I think it's a 2021 or 2022). The older samples start off with a wonderfully airy incense, vetiver and plum combo that I've grown to love. The new version starts off with cardamom, that's it, just a huge cardamom blast. It'll eventually settle down to resemble the older version but it's thinner and lighter.  I've had one spray of each version on each hand and had my wife and mom smell them about an hour after spraying, they both agree that they're similar but that the older formulation is richer and smells better. So for me that settles the performance debate I've seen on here for years. The old version, while still light and modest, performs reasonably well for what it does. Whereas the modern reformulation can only be described as weak and impotent.  Amouage really took a shit when Christopher Chong left and I've smelled a lot of their fragrances pre and post reformulation I can confidently say this has been the worst one by far. And for amouage to deny any reformulations is just malicious gaslighting, there's no denying their reforms and I'll never buy a new bottle from them again."", ""Completely underrated, perhaps because it doesn't have the oomph that some of the other amouages have but make no mistake this stuff is goergous. I get a beautiful soft soapy powdery woody smell that is softened with light resins,warm spices and delicate florals. It may not be powerful but it does last on my skin all day. It creats such a classy posh clean light aura. So easy to wear anytime anywhere without giving it much thought. Of course, being an amouage you get high qaulity ingredients and sublime blending. Overall I place this in my top 5 amouages and very psyched to finally have a full bottle of this beauty."", 'Soft lightly spiced, and powdery. Elegant and sit close to the skin.', 'Smells like my elderly aunties. Smells good though.', 'Beautiful scent. This is definitely one of the best from Amouage for men although it does not have the typical 2000s era, Amouage DNA in it that we all know of, although this is one of the original ones created and sold in the United States.  Very mature, grown up, very versatile in its presentation of scent, as it is a very soft blend with all the notes in it meshed harmoniously without any one particular note standing out or imabalanced. The florals is however the base of the fragrance.  This is definitely an elegant man, very masculine, due to the woody tie-in with the florals. A modern woman (whatever that means) can definitely wear this, if she sees herself so. I wouldn\'t picture anyone younger than 25 wearing this.  This is a great scent for the day time for a nice outing to a museum, to the office, to a convention, etc, something conservative indoors but during the daytime. This scent is not for the club or a concert as it will drown out in an evironment like that. For outdoors, I can see a situation of a yacht club scenario. Being out in a boat (not a rowboat, or outdoors activity style/kayaking) with your linen attire perhaps having a cocktail chatting with others. This is a mild social event fragrance. I typically spray two or three times and it will linger for several hours. The sillage however is very close to the skin. I dont think for a scent like this and its purpose, it needs to project any more than that. You\'ll see what I mean if you smell this on yourself. It is used purposefully when dressed well, and to be accessorized softly near your skin.  It is a discrete scent if you want it to in how you apply it. Demure but confident. This is one of my favorites in all my collection. There is a slight ""designer"" nuance to this. However that may be positive or negative, it is there. It is very wearable, friendly, and people will be receptive if they get close enough to notice it on you. Presentation is always the best, I cant expect less from Amouage; they always hit it out of the park with their bottles and box presentation.

Actually I was more interested about Dia man as it‚Äôs my all time favourite. Dia happen to be the least different perfume from new version, difference is almost negligible. May be vintage Dia has more fruity plum and presence of leather, wee bit richer, darker in the opening. Other than that not much difference.

I get a musky older gentleman vibe from this fragrance, but in a good way, because usually I am not a fan of these kinds of scents, but this one has a lot of character. Floral, woody and slightly fruity the combination makes for such a pleasant cologne. Becoming harder to find but also much cheeper, just the other day I was about to pull the trigger on a bottle for $200 when most fragrances from Amouage are going for 4-$500. Decided to revisit my 2ml vial to see if I wanted it which lead me to think it wasn‚Äôt for me, but also lead me to really appreciate this one so much more and having it on my hand all day, smelling the entire spectrum of this fragrance, I came to realize what a masterpiece this one is. I even woke up in the morning and was still getting whiffs of it, what a beast. Gets a love from me.', 'I was so surprised by this! I honestly did not expect such floral fruitiness from a fragrance marketed to men, but I\'m super pleased by it. I guess I shouldn\'t be too surprised, though... Amouage definitely seems to release either hyper-masculine scents, or ones that bend in the middle a bit (Gold Man, for example). I won\'t say that this smells fruity floral the whole way, it\'s just a fun little twist. Past this opening, it becomes much more powdery and woodsy. The orris root just makes this pop. I\'m in love. Very addictive.

A hint of incense that never goes away to give the frag a touch of darkness & smokiness.  Peony, a note making it smell romantic. Mid/Heart: Patchouli comes into play, and it's not done in a pleasant way. Florals & plum, but frag so weak that it barely stands out. Getting no Orris Root or Ylang-Ylang. Faint hint of leather.

I can't even comment or review the fragrance cause i barely smell anything. This middle eastern company just hustling out it's customers now. Just as my blind-bottle of Jubilation XXV, this is also watered-down thin, disappears after 15 mins. This company dead due to their reformulations.

After initially dismissing Dia - too low-key, too lacking in the strong, rich, resinous characters of the others - I came back around and this became the first full bottle wanted on my list. This is a classic, well-blended, elegant gentleman of a floral/leather scent. You can‚Äôt smell it on yourself as strongly as the louder Amouages, but it‚Äôs there and projecting beautifully to others (as I‚Äôve heard from those around me).  The conundrum - is a beautiful, classy compliment-getter worthy of the price? Or do we need the more in-your-face oud/resin/incense qualities of the others to justify the cost? I do love a classic floral leather, I obsess over my bottles of Knize Ten and Lalique Lion, but I‚Äôm still thinking over that (very individual) question.', 'Overall decent scent from Amouage, it‚Äôs a more wearable version of jubilation 25. With that said the notes are a little bit weaker & lighter which is what makes it more wearable. The overall scent is very nice, it‚Äôs great for occasions where you want to be subtle and not stand out. Great office and everyday easy to wear fragrance. For those that are used to designer frags and just getting into niche & looking into the house of Amouage this would be a good entry point as it‚Äôs they‚Äôre easiest to wear fragrance. For those fragheads looking for something more unique & potent I‚Äôd look at some of the others Amouage has to offer', 'The woody plum amber vetiver combo is beautifully balanced. If I had to simplify the description id say its a juicy plum and vetiver fragrance. Very wearable for an Amouage. I see it appropriate for 30+ and in that age range it is very versatile.', 'Very weak. Smells like expensive soap. Unusual offering from Amouage and one of my least favourites from the house. There are much better and cheaper alternatives out there if you want to smell like luxury soap (ie any of the Prada L‚ÄôHomme line).', 'White florals tend to dominate a scent if not used with discretion, and that is certainly the case here. White and pink aromatic flowers with dry powderiness.  Clean and inoffensive, but that also means it is the most boring of the Amouage fragrances. I can see why it is an ""office scent"".  \'Dia\' translates to \'day\', which I am assuming means this is intended as an everyday scent for men. Well executed, but unless you are a fan of sharp powdery florals, I would suggest another fragrance.', 'Smells wonderfull, but Its very weak, so it Will be a very good summer fragrance for me, i dont enjoy the citrus heavy scents', ""Classic, masculine, soapy/spicy fragrance. For some reason, I ABSOLUTELY ADORE this fragrance! It's my only FB from Amouage and I'm proud of my choice! I wear this more for myself, around the house, but it deserves to be flaunted. I'm not a fan of MOST Amouage frags. Dia and Reflection 45 are my only must haves. Epic has been watered down, sadly. Beautiful presentations, nonetheless. Quality of ingredients are top notch as well. Back to Dia.....think Zaharoff Signature Pour Homme, but less ingredients. That's right, ZSPH is a much better scent (but Dia is still killer!)"", 'Easy pleasurable scent, it has imo all what you need for your signature scent standards as a scent profile, classy clean, fresh, woody, floral, smoke and fruit touches with some sophistication and depth in an orientlazed nature and not offensive, I hope Amouage considering to make a flanker out of this one like interlude 53 , reflection 45, taking it to another level without losing it concept. my only take on this fragrance personally is that the sillage is very close to you "" it‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing"" but the longivity very good and satisfying. In my opinion it deserves the attention.', 'A safe classy outing from Amouage built around their signature Omani frankincense. The perfume opens with the incense surrounded by aromatic hints of cardamom, orange and labdanum. The heart is mostly orris with hints of ylang, plum and peony. The perfume settles on a powdery bed of vetiver, patchouli, woody notes and slight leather. In spite of many notes, this is a muted elegant affair from a house known for heavy punchers like Interlude and Epic. The masculine leaning scent has moderate sillage and good longevity.

Sadly this is the weakest perfume I experienced, than again if this would be stronger probably would lost it magic. Perfect scent when you want something elegant and classy for occasions like wedding or going to expensive events where you don‚Äôt want your perfume to be the main player', ""Basically this is Amouage's office scent and arguably the most expensive office scent out there.  It does take you on a journey you have to patient with this one as the opening isn't exactly something rave about albeit, unusual so much so it reminds me of the opening of Coromandel but nowhere near as strong, this opening disappears after 30 minutes and turns into a fresh slightly powdery beautiful scent where you can just detect the ambergris. its blended so well and its so smooth, I find it a rather unique fragrance and its for someone who wants something different, sophisticated but at the same time toned down and subtle hence why this would be perfect for an office. Edit: I have just found that this is more subtle than most of my current office scents, a bit too subtle."", 'Given the quality this might be a necessary purchase for lovers of traditional masculine scents.

I‚Äôve owned the UK and the Oman versions, and I found the British made version to be a little stronger.', 'Right. I am a woman and I tried it - Demi Rawling made me do this :) As she wears it herself currently.  I am wearing it now. I think this is the 3rd sample of Amouage of mine... and I must tell this House is definitely falling into my taste range. It reminds me of By Killian House concerning complexity, cosiness, surprise, elegance, longevity, uniqueness. As far as I remember, my grandpa had some similar parfume... some of the notes. It means it is timeless. This is just gorgeous. It is hard to describe, as it is so complex and perfectly blended. At the beginning some icy crisp. After 6 hours I might sense some peony and plum, and some woods for sure. Some light sweetness and powderiness. And Freshness! It is in essence like some cotton-y fragrances. Overal it lingers and wraps you in an elegant ""je ne sais quoi"".

There are more masculine notes to try and offset the ""floweryness"" but to my nose this could only be pulled off by a man 60+ or a woman 30+. Seems well made but the flowery note makes this a pretty hard pass for me. It\'s just okay.', ""This juice blew me away. This is what Prada Amber Pour Homme should have been. This is truly the masculine version of that fragrance. Very soapy and clean. Prada Amber Pour Homme sells like a $200 bar of soap and is too feminine for my liking but it is a beautiful fragrance. Dia Man adds a clean but a little bit earthy vetiver, a herbal patchouli, and a noticeable incense note which mans up and kills the femininity you get from the florals. This juice is GORGIOUS and undoubtedly masculine. I do think Amouage took inspiration from Prada but they made it better and made it masculine. This is a 10/10 and a standing ovation for me. Well done Amouage. Update: I was informed that That Dia Man was released before Prada Amber Pour Homme. So, I stand corrected about Amouage taking inspiration from Prada. It's the other way around."", 'Quiet and confident. Beautiful fragrance. Blind bought it based on A.C ""smells good"" reviews on youtube. Elegant and versatile. When you need to slow down and reflect over your life, spray some sprays of Dia Man. Sit down and just be present. Thats what Dia man is to me. A quiet, gentle and loving reminder when you need to slow down the tempo of the world.  Best regards Olly', 'I‚Äôm a big fan of this fragrance for what it is. A lot of feedback I see, I believe there is an expectation of another Amouage powerhouse, which this is not. In my opinion, I would put this as a top, solid choice for an office fragrance. It is clean, has a solid depth, smells classy and rich, and is light to not stand out or choke people out in an office setting. To me, I wear this when I want to smell clean, professional, polished, with status. I work from home, however this is my #1 choice if I have to go for a business trip or rare occasion going to the office. I typically wear this for myself, at home. Again, leans more on the subtle side, not big on projection, but I feel clean and confident when I wear it.', ""I first tried Dia during a week long Amouage sampling binge and it is perhaps the reason I was initially pretty disappointed with it - it definitely doesn't feel challenging in the slightest and I honestly wasn't ready for an Amouage fragrance that feels cozy, easy-going and almost safe. I have used it a few times since and while I did learn to enjoy it in it's own way, I admit I rarely find myself in the mood for it's gentle soapy floral notes. As many have stated before,the most interesting part is the opening (as opposed to most Amouages, might I add) which blends spicy cardamom scent with distinctly citrusy notes (my initial guess was tangerine actually), making it feel suprisingly refreshing for it's profile. The opening is super brisk though and it's followed by a fruity, flowery combo that while not being particularly challenging, is pleasant enough, reminiscent perhaps of a spring garden or orchard. Unfortunately the longevity is kinda underwhelming and I really don't care much for what this fragrance has to offer during the dy-down.... It's pretty much you run-of-the-mill vetiver which feels creamy, combined with floral notes even perhaps soapy feel which I initially found a bit disappointing after the freshness of the opening notes. It doesn't smell bad tho and it does feel like a really inoffensive, office smell which is exactly how I have been using it after my initial test. It preforms reasonably well but again lags behind it's Amouage siblings. All in all, it's a pleasant scent especially fitting for those, who find the more edgy Amouages too much to handle, but I honestly don't think it's a scent I'd be willing to pay the Amouage price for."", ""Not my favorite amouage! It's a pleasant, easy to wear floral-vetiver scent but nothing too impressive. I get a soapy clean vibe, the vetiver gives also a green aspect. The orris and the peony flower give a buttery floral effect with some fruitiness from the plum and some spicy sweet cardamon. It's linear and the only change is on the drydown it becomes more dark with the incense but still not heavy like other amouage fragrances. Performance is ok but not in amouage's stantards, i get about 7 hours longevity and soft projection. It's one of the most versatile of the brand, i find it unique and easy to like. It's an everyday, office friendly and possible signature scent. Overall, i am not impressed. This is the most meh and boring fragrance i smelled from this house. Reflection, Journey and Beach hut have this versatility and are way better fragrances overall! If you like vetiver and you search for something easy to wear and pleasant, try it!"", ""A pleasant slightly sweet soapy-floral fragrance. I would however be more happy if the opening notes (especially the cardamom and incense) would take longer and evolve even further into incense-spiciness. However, the fragrance quite quickly transforms into safe gentleman territory. The fragrance stays like this till the end in my opinion, the base notes function as the backbone (especially the woods and vetiver are noticeable) but do not dominate the whole. The projection and longevity (6-7 hours) are medium, but quite weak compared to the other Amouages I know. Still need to try it in the spring/summer season though. This fragrance is perfect for the work/office environment and to make a good first impression because it's so inoffensive, but still it does smell like quality."", ""Based on the notes, I should hate this. I hate vetiver-based fragrances. I hate cardamom in fragrances. I dislike peony as a note. I'm not the biggest fan of incense, unless blended well. I also don't care about ylang-ylang..... SO WHY DO I LIKE THIS SCENT?!?!? It doesn't make any sense....but I do... I like it :) The first fragrance I don't understand, and that's surprisingly, a good thing."", 'A fairly polite and inoffensive scent from Amouage. I imagine an elegant and mature man wearing this. It is powdery and exudes maturity. Nice offering.  8/10', ""One of the lesser Amouage creations if you ask me. I mostly get a dry, almost bitter vetiver and a faint, dusty floral accord. I'm not sure if it's the peony or plum pairing, but it's very dry and nondescript. Some smoke is added and a sprinkle of cardamom and woods. Not the most interesting composition and I fail to see how, even though this was released back in 2002, it could go up against Amouage's more popular or revered releases. At the end of the day, it's mostly a dry vetiver scent with some faint floral and semi-sweet smoky accords, but that's about it. A smell which will perhaps please a more mature audience. Performance is questionable. I do get some whiffs during the first 45-60 minutes, but it turns into a skin scent rather quickly. Perfect for the office or formal settings. It may be one of Amouage's underrated scents, but in my opnion it's for good reason. 6/10"", 'I‚Äôve been testing Dia Man for a while. Every time I smell it, it makes me think of my dad. No, he has never worn this before. It just smells like the lightest and most airy version of Ralph Lauren Polo in the green bottle. That‚Äôs the easiest way for me to explain what I‚Äôm smelling. I‚Äôm not speaking blasphemy. I‚Äôve been smelling Polo since January of 1988. So I know that fragrance very well.  I bought my mom a bottle of Dia Woman for Christmas because it was a love at first sniff for her. Its masculine counterpart seems perfect for my dad. It‚Äôs so perfect that I want to get him a bottle of it without a special occasion besides being my dad. Not only do I think the juices smell good, but the presentation is top notch also. I love gifting people things that I know are going to be used while still being aesthetically pleasing.  I‚Äôll update if i can find better words to explain this fragrance.', 'Soft, sophisticated, elegant, slightly sweet & soapy freshness. Spraying 4 times and it surrounds me with a beautiful cloud for 6 hours in the morning. High versatility as it doesn‚Äôt have the heavy amouage dna; same as beloved , silver & reflection.', ""A criminally underrated Amouage, this is so smooth and elegant. Probably Amouage's 2nd most designer-like scents, with Reflection Man in first place"", 'Clean elegant gentleman in a bottle, luxury classic soapy texure with oriantal smell and some sophistication,very good performance with soft gentle sillage, floral fruity and woody with a slight dash of sweetness, cardomon and smokyness noticeable but like a shadow, if it was a bit denser could be a very good signature scent all year. Dia ""a shine‚Äù Fits summer time and more for spring imo.', ""On my skin, I get a short-lived blast of incense. Right afterwards, a strong cardamom takes the lead, that might indeed - like the previous reviewer said - remind of mid-range designer fragrances, like YSL La Nuit de L'Homme. In the drydown, I get creamy florals supported by a blurry damp/airy/woody note. A very nice salty vetiver will appear in the late drydown, but I'm not willing to wait so long to enjoy a fragrance unfortunately. Good, but for sure not $340 good especially considering its performance, which stands on the lower side - a no go at that price level. I was expecting more from the hype, but honestly I'm disappointed, and and the late drydown is not enough for me to recommend it, not even at discounter pricing. Just my opinion.

The upper sheet of perfume is too short (3 -2 minutes) and after this step; Initially, the smell of clear roots is clear and then the plum. Here is the scent of Boy to 70 percent similar to the Olfactio Studio - Chamber. But the life of this smell, too short and a fragrance, is a little bit of a fragrance, which is a special bitterness in that. Just smell, at this stage, we still see the combination of the three outcomes that are ongoing at one time: the root of a particular smell and bitterness, especially itself; The plum and its rich state of its perfume, as well as the boom that aroma, is my point of view. It seems that you look at the sea; Not from the beach that you see wave. But from the middle of the sea that does not see a wave and the sea looks so arom. The scent of Dia after 15 minutes created a sensory in me. From here, there is a fragrance to its sophisticated stage. It seems that before the first quarter of the notes were fighting and controversy, and no one with each other. But after a quarter, each one can make themselves; Finally, they are agreed together and they have been together (the overall perfume chords) and create a very lovely smell. So hard to describe this odor. But perhaps he said that at this stage the general smell of perfume; A combination of nation, plus plum. A bitterness is also seen behind these two.

One of my top 5, and Amouage #1. Dia Man came out 18 years ago, in 2002. So the soapy aldehydes are of that era in perfumery. The turn of the millennium, was the beginning of modern era. In the 1990\'s, mens frags were getting out of the powerhouse era, and soapy aldehydes were used more, as in YSL Jazz and Kouros. Dia man is timeless and mostly modern, but it has a touch of classic vib. My favorite reviewer is Colin Maillard, not his real name. He is Italian who works as a translator to English. So his writing is exquisite, and he\'s so perceptive when comes to fragrances. 1,000 of reviews, mostly now on Basenotes. I remember reading his review of Dia 5 years ago. He gave 10/10. And he raved about it as ""Creative artistic"" which he hated to say about fragrances. It was discontinued back then, now rediscovered and blind buy purchased. Memoir Man was my favorite Amouage, and I like the Blue Beast for icy cold. Dia is my #1 Amouage now.  I don\'t care for most Amouage, they are harsh and cold, except Lyric and Reflection perhaps. Dia has creative accords, lush florals with spicy/ earthy Oriental notes. It reminds me of GUERLAIN classics. I love the Guerlain Parisian collection, Derby, Chamade, Voyou, Dandy... Dia was given as an alternative to the discontinued Lupin Dandy, my favorite in series. This does smell like it could belong in Guerlain Parisian classic series. Dia is more modern, but has the subtle beautiful, yes creative accords that Guerlain classics have. A YouTube reviewer said Dia is creamy. I think he meant warm spicy snd soft. The soft florals and powdery oris give it softness, the bitter orange, plum blossom, and dry incense give some balance. I would say, it very slightly leans masculine, but mostly gender neutral perhaps. Dia is the most unlike the rest, of Amouage fragrances.  The cardomom is a main player. The oris makes it a bit powdery. I like the opening when the florals are strongest, some may think, a slight lean feminine at this point. The florals settle, yet remain in accords. Enough for now... This may be my last review. I am trying to stop adding fragrances, as I now have a large, complete mostly niche collection, about 100. Its hard to quit, but being a Christian I have grace from God. If you have Christ as your Savior, He can become your all. You can overcome anything through Him. I am thankful to God for my fragrances, and being able to enjoy exploring, collecting, and reviewing over 500 fragrances. Rating: 9.5/10 God bless. John 3:16', 'High quality, Good for relaxing & watching TV', 'I got this as a sample. Its fine, I was expecting more from the notes but it is pleasant and easy to wear in most seasons and will never be offensive. 6/10', ""WOW. so so very beautiful. I've tried, had and worn most of their range for men many times and i feel well equipped to give solid feedback on this matter.  by far, BY far their best fragrance. under appreciated, definitely underrated, and completely missed by the masses.  I dont want to bag Amouge (they obviously make quality juice), but I cannot for the life of me enjoy what they offer. So dank, fecael, spice market, dry, bitter, unbalanced, aggressive, unwearable. A true niche brand where their niche market is definitely aimed for their region. EXCEPT THIS! Amazing scent. I will go on record and say that its one of the greatest fresh offerings I have ever smelt from any house. so elegant, complex, sophisticated, regal, clean. this i can imagine a prince wearing in the heat of summer in Oman.  A freshy with depth, complexity, crispness and transition. Not linear at all. If you want the most grown up, royal hot day scent, this has to be the one for you. Yes at first its a soapy element but develops into so much more.  The only Amouge that can be worn year round, all occasions and the only Amouge I feel, worth buying.  Just my opinion."", 'Notes: Cardamom, Labdanum, Orange, Frankincense, Iris, Peony, Plum, Ylang-Ylang, Orris Root, Leather, Amber, Patchouli, Vetiver and Sandalwood Dia Man, a soapy, spicy, woody and resionous fragrance. Opens with Incense, Orange, Labdanum which gives this a leathery vibe and Cardamom. Floral notes soon follow along with Vetiver adding that freshness. DIA settles into a woody base of Vetiver, Patchouli and Sandalwood with hints of leather. A very easy to wear fragrance, not overpowering like other Amouages which I love bjt this one is still a winner in my books.', ""Dia Man is so underrated. Many in the community dismiss it as it‚Äôs not loud like some other Amouages. This is a scent that wouldn't work if it was dialled up to 11. It‚Äôs very classy and refined. When you want to present yourself in this manner, you don‚Äôt want a fragrance that‚Äôs in your face. Longevity is not a problem at all. I get over 10 hours with Dia. It‚Äôs the projection and sillage that are soft. Opens up with peony, plum, and incense. The peony does not make this feminine in any way, on the contrary I find this a masculine scent. The heart and dry down are really where Dia man shines. The florals and fruits die down and you are left with a soft incensey vetiver scent; it‚Äôs gorgeous. There‚Äôs something about the dry down that feels quite barbershop to me (which I love), but this isn‚Äôt a typical barbershop scent. Give this one a try if you want to portray elegance. It‚Äôs in my top 5 fragrances of all time. Bravo Amouage!"", 'The aura is soft and near to body, very pleasant gentelman chic soap like, leaning to a fresh side, floral woody and a bit complex, it will project with body heat but not that much, I wish if it was more intense, then truly it will be a ""Dia"" a ""shine"". Worth checking IMO.', ""Beautiful opening. Flowers, cardamom, orange, labdanum. Then plum and vetiver. It lasts for a really long time, despite what people seem to indicate above. A day and a half after one little squirt. But unfortunately I don't like the drydown very much. A chypre, but somehow ends up rubbing me the wrong way."", 'Peony on a sunny Spring morning, eventually fading away into a vetiver-based skin scent.', 'Beautiful scent but don t bet it all on the opening, which is a nice one but on the weaker side. The dry down is quite amazing! Super clean and classy radiating soap.', 'This is class and sophistication in a bottle!Yes,it is a bit mature smelling,but definitely not dated at all,as some reviewers stated,it‚Äôs timeless,and so well blended.For a man,not a guy.A man with an attitude and sophistication in every aspect in life.I haven‚Äôt smelled every Amouage,although i had a chance,and i will,but I must say,i like it more than interlude,Reflection...but maybe not more than jubilation,which every time put me in some other stratosphere for what it stands for.Dia is really really beautiful scent,not challenging by any means,and you‚Äôll leave a great mark wherever you show.The longevity is a little bit dissapointing,but i can live with that better than with a bad smelling fragrance:)', ""As a kid I use to live near this market that sold plants and gardening tools. This is the exact smell the market had. I quite like the scent and it is a nostalgic one for sure. However, I can't past the fact that this fragrance lacks performance. With Amouage price I except more than few hours on the skin, and because for that it is a pass for me."", ""High end blend of a day to day masculine chypre olfactory family. Smells professional because the vetiver is bright and quite prominent while the peony is just giving it a floral vibe, I think it's a linalool accord. Bottle worthy if you want an Amouage that wouldn't collect dust on your shelves. Does Not have that Amouage longevity, but at least it wouldn't assault the nose of everybody around you and won't induce headache for you and everybody around you. Doesn't smell like 50 and up(typical of Amouage) Very elegant and light. Guaranteed to not overwhelm everyone while dining at high end restaurant and let them enjoy their food."", 'Disgusting Eau de BO, slightly rubbery chord, slightly organic and bittersweet, interspersed with another very bad, cheap and weakly aromatic chord: the final result smells like someone who took a shower with cheap soap bought on sale, then ran 5 miles in the sun, sweated like a pig, arrived and stood in front of the fan - hits that BO disguised by the previous bath and mixed with the rubberized clothes, like public bathroom soap mixed with sweat and rubber. Nope.', 'Reminds me of Habit Rouge edt by Guerlain. Both are beautiful but to my nose floral accords are just overpowering and unbearable, although Dia Man is more wearable as compared to Habit Rouge. Floral notes are not letting me to find anything else for last two hours. Would update my review.', 'For the less than one hour that it projects this is indeed a beautiful fragrance. I would classify this as a tragic composition, as its beauty is marred by a fatal flaw, in this case performance.', 'Scent: 9/10 Quality: 9/10 Originality: 7/10 Sillage: 6/10 Projection: 6/10 Longevity: 7/10 Price VS Size: 7/10', 'Lovely vetiver with peony note, with some dried fruit and soft spice from cardamom and light patchouli! Love the scent, hate the performance which is not to Amouage standard: 3-6 hours with very close to skin projection. Definitely try and see if you can get better performance. Great spring summer scent otherwise, will not be detectable in cold weather as the projection will be even less then :( Very unisex frag, maybe leaning slightly masculine but unisex.', 'Now I know why this is called ""Dia Man"" - it\'s one of the few Amouage fragrances that can be worn during the day without feeling guilty! This fragrance has a sweet, soapy, floral greeting that settles into more earthy notes while still maintaining a delicate herbal profile. It\'s very elegant and is right up there with Reflection Man in terms of versatility and longevity.  If you like white flowers, go with Reflection. If you want sophisticated, soapy freshness, this is your Man.', 'Possibly the best opening of any other fragrance I have smelled. The mid and base are similarly gorgeous. Wish it lasted longer. Fortunately Creed‚Äôs Acier Aluminium is similar with excellent performance, albeit not a clone.', 'I understand why people would like this but this is personally one of my least favorite fragrances from Amouage. It‚Äôs softer than most of their other fragrances and it feels VERY mature and not necessarily in a good way- it smells like some of my old family members.

When I purchased Interlude man SA gave me sample of it and disregarded it quite long time due to Interlude charm. One night when I was looking my samples I saw this and tried on paper and it didnt impress me at all. Just some sweety plumby flowery frangrance. but in time I want to clear my sample stocks and start with this one. And oh boy! that was the moment I regreted ignoring this beauty such long time.  This isnt a fragrance or perfume, this is a scent that like your second skin. Not loud but good enough to be heard. Not sweet ( I hate sweet fragrances) but flowery incensy chypre.  At first spray peony welcomes you and it is not for homme only but unisex. in 30 minutes turns into vetiver dominated flowery masculine georgenousness! that's not a alpha male scent like Epic man, but it isnt metrosexual as well. This is a scent which can very easly be signiture scent worthy. It is my second signiture along with Sycomore closely following Epic. Performance wise, dont expect to fill the room but it will be around you (half arm lenght) until 10-12 hours with 3-4 sprays. Which is a pefect for this kind of frangrance.  I love Dia and I think it is very underated due his big loud and extraordinaryly beautiful family member. But for me this and Memoir will always be secret arsenal when I want to feel around with a silent but charismatic aura. For me 10/10 and I can call this as a scent instead of perfume or fragrance."", 'Very nice scent for the office. Soft, but cashmeran and patchouli gives it a push.', ""Dia and Jubilation are by far my favourite from the Amouage line! Dia opens with a fresh balsamic peony that is also a little powdery and dries down to a slightly smoky vetiver! Although you might feel that it doesn't project much, others will definitely notice it even after several hours. I wear it all year round."", 'Although my nose is not as advanced as others, I‚Äôm getting a barbershop Dry down, I like it !', ""The most wearable and crowd pleasing masculine scent within the Amouge house! However, it doesn't last as long as the others, though it is still good when compared to most fragrances from other houses. Will lasts on your skin at least 5-6 hours."", 'This is a beautiful perfume. Soapy fresh and spicy. Also, I get the note of clove although it is not listed. The only downside is that it lucks in performance.', 'The best soapy fragrance in the world! Forget other spapy perfumes like creed original Vetiver like Mugler Cologne or so on! It‚Äôs a soap for a king ...hoooooly mother of god!!!!!! Only negative thing is performance!!! Awesome awesome luxury soap! More reviews on my YouTube channel: Mehdi Scent', ""Dia is the softest Amouage. The combination of vetiver with peony is extremely pleasant and elegant. This is the perfect scent for the office or intimate situations as it is not distracting or tiring because of subtle projection. The longevity is not a beast but it stays close to the skin for solid 4-5 hours:) I really adore Dia as during my fragrance trip I have encountered so many Beast modes and Legendary projectors or Club Killers or so - especially from Amouage, that Dia seems to be a quite nice surprise. Another thing worth adding is that Dia is a rather western style perfume. Yes, it's soapy, but imagine a bath in a soap which brings a smile, tranquility and purifies your senses. Yet anyway, it's a cuddly one. Not an all look at me, please type. I really enjoy wearing it."", ""edit: Found a good deal on this and got a bottle. I have the newer formulation (new box presentation) and it smells roughly the same as the older magnetic version but way weaker and less on the creamy plum aspect, it's more just soapy now. Sometimes fragrances open up more with time and air in the bottle but I would be suprised if that can fix this one. ---- Good, but I expect more from Amouage as some of their best is incredible. This one is a good take on vetiver, with a kind of creamy plum and just a tiny bit soapy floral tone over the top of the dry slightly mossy wood smell distinctive to vetiver. Doesn‚Äôt smell like Bal D‚ÄôAfrique but if you understand how that relates to vetiver you can understand the vibe of this one too (although this is more masculine). It is nice, inoffensive and probably a great office fragrance, but a little less interesting to my nose than a lot of their other fragrances so would say this is not great value and would look elsewhere personally."", ""Softly floral and slightly waxy with a muted woody backbone‚Äîgreyish skin color is what I picture‚Äîvery elegant, collected, and understated; more unisex than masculine.

I have the older non-magnetic version. I've compared it to a sample from a newer bottle, and they are clearly different. My bottle is stronger with more vetiver in the drydown and a bit cooler in the impression it leaves. The sample from the magnetic cap bottle is warmer, more floral, and softer. I like both, and at first I thought I liked the warmer sample more but I've come to appreciate my bottle just as much, if not more due to the greater lasting power. I may have gotten lucky though going by these reviews. It's a beautiful scent either way; it's unfortunate that the strength seems to vary so much."", ""Wasted potential. This is a beautiful, almost unisex scent in my opinion, but it's just too weak to be anything meaningful. Like a beautiful woman with no personality or ambition. Nice to look at, but you get easily bored and irritated. If you're a decent looking guy with options, you will look elsewhere eventually. I own the non-magnetic cap. Scent: A woody floral composition with a bit of a powdered undertone, could be that peony. Performance: abysmal, especially for an amouage. Within an hour it's a skin scent; however, the skin scent lingers for about 2-3 hours.  Season: spring and fall.

Amouage Dia man is a true work of art, I can't find any fault, I feel like it's a bespoke perfume made just for me:). One of the most beautiful thing I've ever smelled. When I wear Dia man it make me feel calm and confident, and help to focus my mind. No other perfume managed to make a this kind of impact, Dia man is more than just a perfume to me.

You know, eat a unripe pear or plum, but not finish it. Just leave the nut with bit of pulp, let it sit and oxidizing. Then you get Dia man. Though the dry-down is divine. Original post: The most prominent note is the woody vetiver, and the peony only here to add a transparent touch to the whole woody concerto, like a crushed twig but not astringent. It doesn't have the usual sweetness of flowers, but somehow they manage to keep all the tenderness of petals.  The green fresh pepper is also noticeable in the beginning, then gradually turns into slightly charred black pepper.

For me, the opening of incense, cardamom, labdanum, and orange constitutes the majority of the experience, even though it settles into a woody base involving vetiver and patchouli and allegedly some leather. I don't get the plum sweetness specifically in the heart, as I was imagining it was the amber in the drydown that balanced out the harsher notes with some sweetness. Overall, Dia Man feels easy to wear---not too floral to ostracize some men, but not too laden with patchouli, vetiver, or leather to scare aware other men, or women, from wearing it or at least enjoying smelling it on someone else. Probably versatile enough to be worn year-round, it's also unisex enough to be considered unisex.

Very nice, and very agreeable, but not so outstanding, which is why it could do perfectly well as a signature scent since it's not controversial at all.

One of my top 5, and Amouage #1. Dia Man came out 18 years ago, in 2002. So the soapy aldehydes are of that era in perfumery. The turn of the millennium, was the beginning of modern era. In the 1990\'s, mens frags were getting out of the powerhouse era, and soapy aldehydes were used more, as in YSL Jazz and Kouros. Dia man is timeless and mostly modern, but it has a touch of classic vib. My favorite reviewer is Colin Maillard, not his real name. He is Italian who works as a translator to English. So his writing is exquisite, and he\'s so perceptive when comes to fragrances. 1,000 of reviews, mostly now on Basenotes. I remember reading his review of Dia 5 years ago. He gave 10/10. And he raved about it as ""Creative artistic"" which he hated to say about fragrances. It was discontinued back then, now rediscovered and blind buy purchased. Memoir Man was my favorite Amouage, and I like the Blue Beast for icy cold. Dia is my #1 Amouage now.  I don\'t care for most Amouage, they are harsh and cold, except Lyric and Reflection perhaps. Dia has creative accords, lush florals with spicy/ earthy Oriental notes. It reminds me of GUERLAIN classics. I love the Guerlain Parisian collection, Derby, Chamade, Voyou, Dandy... Dia was given as an alternative to the discontinued Lupin Dandy, my favorite in series. This does smell like it could belong in Guerlain Parisian classic series. Dia is more modern, but has the subtle beautiful, yes creative accords that Guerlain classics have. A YouTube reviewer said Dia is creamy. I think he meant warm spicy snd soft. The soft florals and powdery oris give it softness, the bitter orange, plum blossom, and dry incense give some balance. I would say, it very slightly leans masculine, but mostly gender neutral perhaps. Dia is the most unlike the rest, of Amouage fragrances.  The cardomom is a main player. The oris makes it a bit powdery. I like the opening when the florals are strongest, some may think, a slight lean feminine at this point. The florals settle, yet remain in accords. Enough for now... This may be my last review. I am trying to stop adding fragrances, as I now have a large, complete mostly niche collection, about 100. Its hard to quit, but being a Christian I have grace from God. If you have Christ as your Savior, He can become your all. You can overcome anything through Him.

There is a nice blending of spice, floral and wood that is well balanced and harmonious. The opening is quite lovely with spicy/musky cardamom mixing with the ever so lovely cistus and bigarade. I have begun to really enjoy plum and plum blossom notes in fragrances, and here it offers a sweetness and fruitiness which is perfectly paired by the exotic ylang-ylang and powdery orris.

It feels red, accompanied by molten, ambery, labdanum to increase this effect. To my nose, there is an unlisted note of iris-- in the powdery, talcum direction, similar to the finishing powder they use in barber shops. It adds a dignified, fresh, gentleman like quality to the composition, and cleans up the animalic edges of oud. In old descriptions of this fragrance pyramid, you would often find Mandrake root as a key note. To my nose, this is quite accurate and depicted well here.  I once tried Mandrake root as a tea to treat arthritis pains. I remember the scent of the unboiled roots so well: a mix between dried patchouli leaves, Palo Santo wood, and licorice root.

Wow! Maybe a bit like rum and coke. An interesting scent, I like it.', ""Review is for OG M7. It is indeed a masterpiece. Fragrances like these make me wish I had gotten into the scent game when this launched long ago. Now I can detect patchouli in here albeit not listed on the note but I feel like this is the same patchouli found in Tuxedo but amplified and on a semi-sweet oud base. I also think this shares a similar sweetness like what you would find in mugler pure havane. It'a mature and playful at the same time! Glad to have found a well preserved bottle with a good amount of juice left!"", ""Back in the day this was massive It played like a niche scent, no had ever heard of oud I was late to the scene, about 5 years after this came out, but even then no one else touched oud So with that in mind, it's important to respect the history and how much of a trailblazer this was, but it's a bit tame by today's standards It's a dark, amber scent with woody notes and it lasts all day I still have a little left, but when it runs out I won't look to buy a new one It's great, but since this came out there are better scents to go for"", 'In 2006 I asked my gf for the new YSL cologne. Lol She went to the perfumerie store in the mall, the one that sells older bottles or hard to find ones and asked for YSL and got me this one! Lucky for me.  I didn‚Äôt know this brown bottle of M7 would be so highly coveted. I smelled it and was like YUCK! Smells like old man. Haha. I wanted the new YSL L‚ÄôHomme, which I bought years later.  I still have M7 and I can appreciate it now. Cool to have a ‚Äúvintage‚Äù bottle. Lol. Now I have both.', ""In the realm of fragrances, M7 was standing as an enduring testament to the artistry of perfumery. Created by the talented duo of Jacques Cavallier and Alberto Morillas, this Amber Woody masterpiece not only captures the essence of male sensuality but also represents a pinnacle of sophistication and craftsmanship. As the seventh men's perfume by YSL and the second collaboration with Tom Ford during his tenure as the creative director, M7 remains an iconic fragrance that has left an indelible mark on the world of luxury scents. It is with a sense of reverence and admiration that one approaches this olfactory symphony. The top notes of Rosemary, Mandarin Orange, and Bergamot set the stage for an olfactory journey that is both invigorating and refined. The crispness of citrus blends seamlessly with the herbal warmth of Rosemary, creating an opening that is as captivating as it is distinctive. The heart of M7 unfolds with the rich and exotic notes of Agarwood (Oud) and Vetiver. This composition exudes a deep, mysterious allure that speaks to the complexity of masculinity. The interplay of these notes is masterfully executed, showcasing the perfumers' ability to balance intensity with subtlety. The foundation of M7 rests upon the timeless combination of Amber and Musk. These base notes bring a sensuous and lingering quality to the fragrance, leaving an unforgettable trail that resonates with both confidence and sophistication. It is disheartening to write bad reviews for recent disappointments with the brand's newest releases, as expressed in your review. However, let M7 stand as a reminder of Tom Ford's ability to create olfactory masterpieces that transcend time and trends. Perhaps, in time, the brand will return to the heights of elegance and excellence that it once embodied. Until then, let us celebrate the enduring legacy of M7 as a symbol of what Tom Ford and YSL achieved when they were creating with passion and dedication."", 'Hi, Animal scent, warm, shocking for some, spacious, women are not indifferent to it, durability 12 hours, projection 4 hours, masterpiece', 'ÿßŸàŸÑ€åŸÜ ÿπÿ∑ÿ±€å ⁄©Ÿá ⁄Üÿ¥ŸÖ ÿ®ÿ≥ÿ™Ÿá ÿÆÿ±€åÿØŸÖ €åŸá ÿ¥ÿßŸá⁄©ÿßÿ± ÿ®€å ÿ™⁄©ÿ±ÿßÿ±', ""M7, the original blend has a masculine character that is powerful yet sophisticated, intoxicating, yet emphatic. Its articulation of masculinity is nuanced as seen through the interaction of the different elements of the blend and the blend itself is masterly. It's a matter of public record that Tom Ford's development and release of this fragrance was bold, bold in the sense that the western market was not familiar with Oud, despite its cultural power throughout Arabian culture. Thus, the use of Oud in M7 original was subtle, just enough to convey its mystique, but compared to most middle eastern blends of Oud, its use is toned down. I note that other posters here have commented at length about the idea of masculinity in relation to this development and how it has changed since the development of M7. I think some of the intellectualising around masculinity can descend into cliche and navel gazing. In the late 90s/early 2000s when M7 was being developed, masculinity had begun to change in the West (not necessarily elsewhere) and had become less one dimensional - 10 years of no major conflicts involving NATO countries and the influence of more post-modern pop culture icons who drew inspiration from the likes of Bowie and Madonna's gender play helped a lot of men to feel more relaxed about what in fashion and grooming terms represented masculinity. Working class men in most of the 20th century had fought wars, built towns and cities and won sports achievements, not intellectual middle class guys. As a result, pop culture and masculinity was defined by working class men who portrayed themselves as stoic, resolute, strong and brave. Critiques of such a notion of masculinity aside, that way of portraying masculinity was borne out of circumstance as much as cultural mores. References to 80s masculinity wrapped up with cocaine use are cliched and not founded in reality. If you don't believe that go and speak to folks in their 60s and 70s and ask them how cheap cocaine was in the West in the 80s, it wasn't, it was a rich person's drug. Most men's grooming and fragrance habits in the 80s and 90s were pretty conservative, unlike now, as we live in a more liberated age. In that context, M7 was an outlier and arguably quite a highbrow fragrance for the mass market appeal of YSL. In essence, class affiliation still binds for the most part, the style of fragrances brought to market by large houses such as YSL. I agree with the idea by the way that you should just wear what you want (I also acknowledge that it is a view borne out of either boldness and self-possession, but more likely a middle class approach to life), but most working class folks would not subscribe to such a view. It is utterly bizarre that the term masculinity could be triggering or 'problematic' but cliches about toxicity aside, we do live in an age of mass confusion."", '@Ansary , where and how much ?', 'i have a full bottle not sealed dm if interested', ""This joint masterpiece by Morillas & Cavallier was ahead of its time.

Shame this fragrance will not be made the same way. 10/10!', 'Cough syrupy oudy musky mess with unbearable fruity bitter sharp smokiness unbalanced perfume sorry. 4/10', 'I wrote this a few years ago: but it was taken off where it was posted: Again another long one, with metaphors, similes and analogies. Here goes: In the 80s the idea of masculinity was still transitioning from the idea of guy who had typified \'Manliness\' for generations from the start of the 30s, the kind of guy gut-punched first and then asked his wife when they were going to have boring sex later, into a guy who cleansed, toned and moisturised over the coke-OD\'d dead call-girl of the Yuppy riddled late 80s. The stars of yesteryear\'s silver screen still a presence and influence over many young boys and producers and creators to the point that any chance of representation was often a lazy imitation of the stars of the 40s, 50s and 60s. Masculinity was often represented as stony-faced, wide-legged, and monosyllabic. John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Steven Seagal - all have this \'tough guy\' pastiche and persona of masculinity, though, it does not say \'masculine\' to me; in my opinion its closer to parody - almost like they are affectations of masculinity is more so a reminder to themselves of what they think denotes ""being manly"". Masculinity doesn\'t advertise. \'Masculinity\' not a dirty word; I consider it a positive; I believe that as an aesthetic masculinity has been done a massive disservice; its either been diluted to a point of neutrality or aligned to the alt-right/inceldom/misogyny bullshittery. Like with femininity; masculinity has its own beauty which is often misinterpreted. I believe in balance; from an aesthetic point of view there needs to be both male and female elements for beauty (opinion not statute) to be realised. The (high) Renaissance knew this, Little Richard, David Bowie, Grace Jones, Rick James, Prince...shit even ""Gangsta"" Rappers and Drag Queens knew this! And Tom Ford knew this. I think fashion has the similar idea on the masculine aesthetic; though I think its always skewed it further possibly too much toward the \'feminine\'. I don\'t think there has been a celebration of \'the male\' since Tom Ford\'s at Gucci,YSL (and when his own brand launched). I think he was at his peak within this ten year period (watch the 1995 Gucci catwalk show - its akin to other iconic moments from the nineties). In this period he oversaw the production of two (out of the three what I think are the best male fragrances from YSL): Rive Gauche and M7. Both of these scents smell like the powerhouses of the early 80s late 70s. Tom Ford has often returned to this style of scent more often than in these two examples and its done to great effect- and they are celebrations of \'masculine beauty\'. Both these YSL scents have been discontinued for whatever reason (stupidity or trying to appeal to the mass non-fragcomm market I suspect), then both came back as part of some shallow marketing from YSL (La Collection) then discontinued again - yeah fuck you YSL. I got my hand on 10mls of the M7 reissue; and I love this thing! I missed this when it came out in the early 2000s. Regretfully. I cannot express how this stuff has catapulted itself into my \'Perfect 16\' curated collection. There is another \'flanker\' called M7 Oud Absolu - its such a lazy flanker that it is closer to being a close reformulation (which these La Collection issues really are). On the internet the notes from three different sites (Basenotes, Fragantica and Parfumo) are ranging from sparse to complex; though there is no mistaking the inclusion of Oud. But this is a typically western Oud, not the heavy \'medicinal/barnyard\' oud. Oud adjacent. There is a musk accord, a dry deep patchouli and an enveloping amber. The whole impression is this deep spicy red (for reference pantone 20-0076 tpm) that is at once warm and cold; the original bottle was a similar colour and a masterstroke by the bottle designer. I cannot speak on the projection or longevity as I could still smell it after a few hours (5-8) and I don\'t know if anyone could smell it on me as I don\'t care. As soon as my decant arrived I tested it in a strip, then did the \'cup thing\' (honestly look it up it works!) then I wore it for a whole day; I accidently sprayed some on my ear and jaw (slippy hands) It was a happy accident; as throughout the day it would waft from my head and I would really get a great impression of it. It\'s so deep of a scent yet not dark though there is an initial impression but like I said it is oddly vibrant though a dark vermillion. This is a sensual male scent it harks back to classics from the 70/80s, it is inherently masculine, very much \'male\' and it is reminds me of classical male beauty - probably because of the advertising. Looking at the advert, seeing the reclined nude male model is is reminiscent of classical art - male beauty is at the centre of representation. This is a scent for \'Men\' and by this (I\'m very prepared for the back lash from the \'wear what you like\' squad) I mean over a certain age - like old enough to wear a suit and not look like they were made to by their mother\'s, old enough to realise they are not the centre of the world; sorry but if you\'re a teenager or have to ask if this will get you compliments or \'can be worn to college\' don\'t bother this is a sweet tonka/vanilla compliment panty-dropper. Can women wear this - fuck yeaaa- but, think Jessica Chastain in \'Zero Dark Thirty\' than Bryce Dallas Howard in \'Black Mirror: Nosedive\'. This is the type of masculine I mean; it retains a rich and clear impression of masculinity that also has \'feminine elements\' that accentuate perfectly. It\'s masculinity without the sore bollock-waddle-walk of John Wayne, the constipated sneer of Dirty Harry or the flappy-armed girly-run of Steven Seagal. No macho-affectations. No this is Viv Richards at the crease, Edwin Moses at the start line, Ayrton Senna behind the wheel, Starbuck/Templeton Peck, Buck Rogers, Colt Seavers, Carl Weather\'s running on a beach...real masculinity, just doing their shit without fanfare of their \'manliness\'. 9.2/10', 'Would love to try this if anyone wants to sell a small OG decant.

All iterations of the scent are hard to find and opportunities to smell the scent are increasingly rare. I finally overpaid for a small decant of the 1st formulation (which then quickly sold out) and though it's cold comfort compared to a partial, I'm glad I have the chance to experience the scent. After all that effort, it would be a sin to leave the scent unreviewed, wouldn't it?  My immediate thought on first spray was that I was in for a good ride. There's an easy wearing quality and instant appeal from the opening. M7 really feels like a proto-Tom Ford scent. The scent is much sweeter than scents of its time, providing a soft sensual allure to the wearer. Like Tom Ford scents, it's unique, but follows relatively simple two-stage development. The scent starts with the prevalent sweetness of mandarin, supported by a light aromatic facet of sage/rosemary. The scent quickly evolves in a swirl of vinyl, musks and aromatics, helped along by an oud facet that evokes Oud Wood or Black Caviar. The oud here is nothing medicinal or barnyard, but instead adds a plasticky character that I constantly reference in a sub-genre of oud scents, where oud as a supporting character adds an alien character to what would otherwise be a typical scent. Here, as the scent tends towards musky ambrettolide, oud bolsters the richness of the musk and adds a butteriness that's hard to find in musky scents.  At this point in time, I couldn't be helped but reminded of Homme Parfum. DHP unquestionably references M7; both scents share common notes of sweet citrus, ambrette, oud, amber and a similar buttery, musky texture. In all my smelling, I haven't come across similar ambrette scents, which itself is a rare note. However, M7 feels like an accord of DHP, which adds on darkness, sweetness and complexity. Though unfair to compare the two, M7 does not stand up to its successor which by all metrics is harder, faster and stronger. M7 is not a projecting scent, instead providing a diffuse personal trail. The scent flits in and out throughout the day, and actually is hard to detect. Incredibly,12 hours later as I am typing in an ambient room, M7 is still here with me projecting diffuse sweet amber with light musk.  Ultimately, the story of M7 looms much larger than the scent itself. It smells great BUT doesn't have that same wow factor that DHP brings. Blind-buyers (with a large nest egg) won't regret M7 for its scent but for current market prices, better choices can be made through more modern alternatives."", ""im happy to have this in my collection finally. got the long red square bottle. managed to cop it for a price that doesn't cost and arm and leg. and i must say. its something. but not to over exaggerate it. initial opening of rosemary, bergamot and madarin. rosemary lingers a bit then immediately dries into a clean synthetic oud all the way with a very salty sweet warm musky amber. very base heavy you're gettin this till the end.  being one of the first introductions of oud into european markets you can really tell that it is bit rough around the edges. actually most of the things notes around it like vetiver seem there to be added to clean up the strong ambers and synthetic oud. its a great frag not too complex but just enough, master piece? up for debate.. i get some sort of faint sweet apricot wood accord prob cuz of what the amber does with the oud but there could be some vanilla in here. slightly animalic touch. hidden background powder used as a ''clean up'' note but you can't pick it up by itself. its of the silky variety giving it an overall very smooth and masculine effect.  it's nice. lasts long, projects. but i'll probably wear this very little since it's all i will probably ever get. i dont regret paying price. but from the amounts ive seen it listed for tbh it doesn't add up. as much as i love this, you can tell that middle eastern style introduction here was new. they did a great job with this. but it can come off medicinal cherry cough syrup at times. comparing this to like more modern takes of similar profiles, you're gonna miss that unique rough character but you will be getting smth lot more refined and complex. either way its historic fragrances exactly like this that i make me enjoy the hobby of collecting but don't just blindly throw money at something. it's honestly nothing more than a collectors piece. if you're into that definitely try it."", ""I have the 1st edition (pre-reformulation) and I'm really liking it. What I like about it is the powdery aspect added to the darkness and opulence.

Allow me to explain. This was the very first oud fragrance marketed to the West, done so perhaps more than a decade before oud became a thing in mainstream perfumery. It is also a Tom Ford YSL fragrance, which is extra legit. It smells like the color of the bottle and has a very medicinal, cherry cough syrup scent to the uninitiated. For my nose, it is an Indonesian oud, which lends to a medicinal, slightly foresty/green feel. However, it is an incredibly wearable cold weather fragrance.

Appartently they used to go for 400- 500 bucks and what's funny is some people are actually buying the Aftershave lotion too, thinking they're getting the scent for a little less, well for anybody who doesn't already know, the difference between aftershave lotion and Eau De Toilette (the EDT is the one you should be picking up) - is the Aftershave lotion is what you use after you shave on your face and neck, the EDT is the actual scent or fragrance, the term Aftershave is used interchangeably to describe both the lotion and EDT. But do not buy a scent that says Aftershave or Aftershave lotion, well unless you want to wear aftershave lotion elsewhere other than your neck or face, but the aftershave lotion is not a scent it's to put on your face.

I have the latest release so can't compare to original. But the big question is would I pay the crazy prices M7 is going for right now? No because my bottle should last a lifetime since I wear sparingly. And this is a 2 spray kind of beast. But what if I didn't have a bottle? Well, put it this way.

I‚Äôve been using this since 2003, and paying crazy money to keep it in my small collection. Always get asked about this scent and don‚Äôt mind telling, since this is almost extinct. This will always be my favorite.', ""To be clear I am reviewing the more recent version of M7- Square bottle/ 'M7 Yves Saint Laurent' printed on the front/ 'ACCORDS- MANDARINE, BOIS DE OUD, PATCHOULI, CISTE, MYRRHE, 2002' printed on the side. I bought it online and don't know much else. But it is not the original, or the M7 Absolu. To start I pick up very little mandarin orange in the opening. But the Ciste, or Labdanum which I know so well from Mancera's Hindu Kush is prominent and carries throughout the dry down. The Oud is there, but blended in a way that is better suited for the Western nose. In fact, the Oud, patchouli and Myrrh are so well blended that its hard to define them as separate entities. I've only every tried Dua fragrance's copy of the original M7 named D7. That is a dirtier, less complex fragrance than mine. There is no barnyard like funkiness from the oud in my M7. But it is a very labdanum centric fragrance to my nose. So if you do not like labdanum this is probably not for you. It is not a beast, but it does linger. I do enjoy it now in the cooler weather. But the labdanum combined with the oud can be a bit cloying if applied to close to your nose. Back of the head, down the shirt and the extremities work well for me. 3-4 sprays is enough. Not a signature scent for me, but a wonderful addition to my collection. Will wear it 1-2 times a week from now till Spring for sure. I was able to pick it up for under $50 but would not want to invest more than that. Very happy I could pick it up. It is quality juice though and worth the retail price if you want to stand out from the crowd. Longevity 8 plus hours/ Masculine, but a strong, confident woman could wear this and be extremely sexy/ for mature noses 35 plus/ great sillage/ not a safe blind buy/ not a compliment magnet but more of a niche scent- wear it for yourself."", ""The pinnacle of wearable oud! My bottle is flipping old‚Ä¶.I mean, probably one of the first off of the line!! This garnered so much attention through the years and rightfully so. The oud was always prominent but is more on sweet side backed by amber. Mystery is a bottle! It never failed to impress!! I decided to take it for a ride again after vaulting it for quite a few years. The top notes are completely gone‚Ä¶probably because it‚Äôs an EDT. It‚Äôs pretty soft in the opening‚Ä¶a very light cedar with a faint cola vibe. As it dries down the DNA starts to shine‚Ä¶but not as pungent and in your face like it used to be. It‚Äôs like a more tame Nasomatto Pardon!  I wish I would have worn this more through the years because I feel like it‚Äôs a shell of its former self. Longevity is cut in half but when it‚Äôs on my skin, it‚Äôs 100% bliss!  Cheers! EDIT: Since my review, I've given it a few full wearing's and the top notes have decided to resurface! Now this is what I remember!!!! Rugged yet soft.....brash but comforting....so much going on here! Boy, this takes me back to simpler days of care-free living!

From an age when phones, tv, cars and pizza were not yet smarter than the people using them.  When it was first released M7 was an instant love. The scent, the ad, the bottle. I busted M7‚Äôs ass on a daily basis. And why would not I. Underneath all the cherry woody ambery goodness there is this sneaky little dirty oud waving cheekily at me. Needless to add that my 2003 all red M7 still smells better than most of today‚Äôs oud wannabes.  *****', ""This masterpiece is so difficult to review, I always find it difficult to explain that I particularly like them also because it is like dissecting my intimacy, it becomes a very personal thing and honestly I don't know where to start, but let's start with a similarity. Compared to modern perfumery, M7 is an orange spot in a sea of gray. It is certainly one of the most beautiful, original and fascinating perfumes I have ever smelled. I went in search of M7 when the hype wasn't as high as it is now, as soon as I smelled it, I immediately felt that it had something different than all the other perfumes. Today it has become almost impossible to find, and deserves all the hype surrounding it. To understand the essence in all its completeness it seems only right to start from the birth of this perfume. In 2002, Tom Ford, creative director of Yves Santi Laurent deals with the marketing of the seventh fragrance of the group, for this reason it is called M7, and he succeeds very well, the bottle, the mysterious amber parallelepiped is more striking than the nude used as a testimonial, a trusted creation. in Morillas and Cavalier, not two common noses. The thing that makes this perfume special is the introduction of real agarwood, never used before by Western homes. Today there are an infinite number of perfumes containing oud, but with the difference that in M7 the oud is real and not synthetic, and also blends perfectly with the ingredients, it does not want to be a perfume made mainly of oud and more. The opening of M7 is nothing short of overwhelming, aggressive, it is a paw of a tiger, medicinal, pungent spicy, dried herbs, mandarin rosemary and Haitian vetiver which then blend perfectly with amber, the round and woody oud, but not chewy as we are used to in modern perfumes. The perfume with the passage of time becomes sweeter, amber, dark, it lies gently on the skin remaining slightly powdery, deep, soft, modern despite being a 20-year-old perfume, it stimulates the senses, very versatile, and above all, elegant, masculine, oriental, absolutely three-dimensional, dense and damn sexy and long-lasting. And there is another reason why they like M7 so much, by now I was tired of perfumes, I had boxes full of the usual cheap perfumes that now appear like mushrooms on the shelves of perfumeries, M7 was my key to perfumes vintage / discontinued, it made me understand you can find emotions in the bottle even in old perfumes, finding old gems has given me a lot of satisfactions that not even the best niche could give me. I knew this review was going to be long and I'm sorry if I bored you. I close with a banality but it is the harsh truth, they will never make perfumes like this again. Rated 10/10"", 'So by now all of the people experiencing M7 original are having a vintage experience. I searched for decants of this for awhile. The first decant I didn‚Äôt quite appreciate. I figured that m7 had gone bad with age, and I have found some different decants that are a little better, but I was expecting some loud beastly scent... M7 is much more subtle than that. The amber oud musk mixture is beautiful but it does have somewhat of a feminine quality to it in the way you might find Dior homme intense as more metro or unisex. It is unique. I have grown to love and long for this one. It lasts and probably allows for unique wafts off you for hours. I think it is a great gentleman scent. it is a shame this has been discontinued. The new m7 isn‚Äôt the same, but you can get a pretty decent idea of the scent.', 'ÿßÿπÿ™€åÿßÿØ ÿØÿ± ÿπŸÖŸÇ ÿ®ÿ±ŸáŸÜŸá €å ÿπŸàÿØ ----------- Scent & Quality: 10/10 Longevity: 8/10 Sillage: 8/10 Creativity & Uniqueness: 9/10 Affordability: 5/10 ----------- Overall: 8/10', ""An iconic fragrance such as the 2002 M7 deserves to be tried, and I was fortunate to find a bottle of the original juice and gladly added to my collection. Naturally, I have scoured the reviews, all of them, good, bad and neutral, and now would like to add my humble opinion. The bergamot and mandarin opening is like a rush of fruity goodness. Do I get the cherry cough syrup? No, but I can see how some noses might interpret it as such. I get more of an Italian vermouth vibe, specifically, Carpano Antica. The middle notes of Vetiver and Agarwood begin almost immediately to tame the fruit, but not eliminate it. But it's the Musk and Amber that are the stars. Longevity is at least 12 hours, but if you spray it on your clothes, you can expect a much longer duration. There was some discussion of comparing this to a much more inexpensive Avon product, Premiere Luxe Oud. I have both and last evening I sprayed the back of each hand with each. One spray only. The openings of both definitely share a DNA chain, but it's the dry down that catapults the YSL to stardom. The Avon dries down to a pencil shaving scent, while the YSL keeps that Amber and Musk shining, long into the night. In the morning, I still smelled the YSL, while the Avon was just a memory. Now, one could argue that the price difference more than makes up for the lack of longevity and eventual dry down smell, however, one could also make an argument that a VW gets you to your destination as well as a Mercedes. Indeed, that's what we're comparing here, a luxury vehicle vs a Yugo.  I am glad I have both, but I am so very pleased to have the original YSL M7 in my collection. It's a masterpiece of perfumery. Next comparison will be against the M7 Oud Absolu (Black label)."", ""To my nose, M7 is the genesis that brought TF Private Blends to the fragrance world. Equal parts Moss Breches and Oud Wood, it instantly brought a smile to my face today after many years of missing its glorious aroma. The first blast brings an almost cinnamon-like, cozy haze of woody oud-y goodness that is hard to match. It's rich, but it's not heavy. It's edgy, but it's balanced. It's smoky, but it's smooth. For men my ass. Anyone can wear this, and anyone should if they can get their hands on this gem. One of the best ever. Period."", '(Review of original formula bottle from January 2003, batch nr. 3003) In my opinion one of the best designer ouds ever made and one of the first ones too! It starts out with a herbaceous citrus mix that quickly fades away (could be because my bottle is 17 years old though) and gives way to a gorgeous oud, vetiver, amber, and musk mix. And for once, the oud actually (kinda) smells like oud! A classic woody, dark, kind of peppery oud. Even though the oud is great I don\'t think it is the main player here. Instead the amber and musk really shine together in a way that reminds me of Musc Ravageur (2000) but, dare I say, better. ü§≠ To me it smells dark, smooth, and very masculine. You can definitely tell it was an inspiration for Tom Ford\'s later Oud Wood (2007), although this one is a LOT darker and feels more ""full"" where as Oud Wood feels a bit hollow to me. The sweetness of the amber is also better balanced in M7. I haven\'t tried the later releases of M7 so I can\'t compare this to them.

Objectively, the two perfumes compared the first and the version now on the market, are completely different. The shades are sometimes small sometimes they are very noticeable. The first M7 is an enveloping and complex perfume, I don't like it very much but the second is something terrible for my sense of smell and I think also for those around me, I can't smell it. The perfume M7 first version is instead very warm in the dry down, is a game from Oud-Oud-amber, beautiful Amber-Oud-Musk-Rosemary in the hearth, only warm nice Amber in the end. Sorry but the new M7 is very different not have this games in the skin. I like the original and unique first version M7. And the design of the first version bottle? Simple Californian Modern Art.

Oud is only very light, if at all. It smells really grand, though. I don‚Äôt know when or where I would wear it.

It is extremely strong and very long lasting, so it needs to be handled with care, too much means that it's notes can't be fully appreciated.  For me the main opening is one of thick incense backed up by smokey wood with the oud liurking with real intent in the background. It conjures visions of a Catholic Church being visited by a Arab caravan trading in spices. The dry down settles in after a few hours and its potency seems to last forever. The incense becomes more distant and merges into a dark powdery spiciness that has to be experienced first hand to be fully perceived.

Don‚Äôt you have enough fame and respect‚Äù - on which Saint-Laurent replied- ‚Äútrue perfumes are made to be warn on our skin, be part of us.. this perfume is worthy of beautiful male skin - so have it! Uncovered!‚Äù  Now, the Taschen published long ago a book ‚ÄúMale Nude‚Äù. There is a black/white picture of nude Yves Sain Laurent himself when he was young. Oh my heart! - please find it.. one look to see that the Master (Saint Laurent always will remain my favorite figure in fashion, even though I am not crazy about his House after he‚Äôs gone) - the Master is not from this world.. and it‚Äôs not about plain erotica.. just find and see.  Also hold in mind who was the executive person to create this treasure- Tom Ford (think of all his mind set and further campaigns).  I don‚Äôt know better and more sensual wood in men‚Äôs perfumes.. I do not agree that it‚Äôs powdery as mentioned - ‚Äúpowder‚Äù is olfactory illusion for this one if you overwhelm your nose, if you overspray. Be patient- don‚Äôt shove nose into freshly applied area, let it sink to body hair and skin. Then it will start radiate warmth and depth, all the shades of a tree that absorbed sun and wind, water and minerals - turning them into organic life, starting to glow.  This fragrance lasts eternity. Next day if I get emotional - the invisible sweat breaks up from the skin - and it releases new waves of aroma. If I wouldn‚Äôt have to shower- I would not know if it ever ends.  I know now that M7 cannot be re-launched. You can‚Äôt do anything with cheap synthetics in here.

This guy actually has chunks of oud lying around in his house, and more than one kind. Yea, true story.

This is just so perfectly what I ever wanted in a perfume. It's an oud, with amber that does not have any vanilla in it to taint the amber. Damn vanilla!! And ohhhh, what an amber it is! To die for. Not really mentioned by others, but I really pick up the rosemary in this. Makes sense, I guess, I mean I do speak for the trees and all. ;) The rosemary is what really sets this apart from any other Amber you will smell. I can't describe what this note contributes in words, but is just wonderful. Think of a deep dark, but yet not sharp piney smell. Kinda like rosemary, I guess, lol.

This fragrance is the quintessential blending of oud into a designer fragrance that doesn't go overboard with sweetness. M7 was one of those game changers not only for perfumery but also for myself and my personal tastes in perfume. This scent represented linking the exotic with the classic and romantic and doing so effortlessly and beautifully. M7 is deserving of its' hype and truly does represent what haute designer perfumery used to be and needs to return to. M7 starts off with a smooth, almost medicinal smelling oud that is accentuated with some amber and a really perfectly rendered vetiver. This trio smolders in the opening, the effect is smoky, sensual and very enticing, M7 then freshens up a bit with some rosemary. This herbal injection prolongs this beautiful amber and oud combo. The mandarin orange and musk then settle in giving this scent a warm masculine touch and an added depth. As M7 evolves the oud is never buried under other notes, it is more or less enhanced by the other notes, allowing the oud to show it's full range (the oud is able to release its' dirty and slightly skanky side in a great way!). The separation of notes in this composition is very clear and attests to the quality of this scent. Overall, M7 finishes off classy, sexy and very sophisticated.  M7 is an exotic wonder, this is a world traveller in a bottle. M7 is that statement fragrance, that announces someones confidence, maturity and sensuality. This fragrance is masculine but can easily be worn by a woman, in fact my wife will wear this from time to time and it smells amazing on her. M7 is great for the late twenties to late thirties crowd. Keep M7 out of the office, it is too good to waste in a work environment. This fragrance is perfect for date nights, and on dressed up or dressed down winter occasions. M7 should be worn across the chest (on bare skin) and around the neck to really use your body temp to warm this scent up in cold winter air. M7 will draw in your better half and will give you a sensual element to your scent repertoire. Give this a few sprays on a cold evening when all you want to do is let out your brazen romantic side with that special someone."", ""This magnificent fragrance is very similar vibe to mancera sand aoud.i was very suprised nobody else has picked up on the similarities.

Its an oriental, a balanced, sophisticated gentleman's oriental.  These days M7 can't be purchased by the average buyer without experiencing substantial buyer's remorse.

After smelling some other Oud's and getting to where I kind of have some more experience with the note, I can begin to understand why something like M7 is blended the way it is. The dark resinous wood smell has to mix with something like that to make it wearable. I have the Oud Wood by Tom Ford, which is one of my most and best complimented frags on my skin, and my favorite Niche Oud by Armaf, but this one really got me into the game on Oud, and I'm really glad to have it in my collection. It still smells a bit dark mysterious, with a bit of that cough syrupy vibe at pretty much the beginning. After about 15 minutes in its dark, resinous wood. That's mostly what I get.

True craft delivered by Cavallier & Morillas.', 'seems tame now compared to what it seems when it came out..similar to Oud by Kurkdjian in my opinion. Very long lasting', 'Dark, resinous, and powerful, in terms of intensity, YSL M7 lives up to the hype that it\'s built as a bygone fragrance from the Tom Ford era of YSL. Seemingly a mix of oud, incense, and resin, but nothing too well-defined, lending credence to its superb blending. I do like how it sweetens and the sharpeness gives way to sweetness in the dry down. It\'s sophisticated, masculine, and strong, while not being overpowering or cloying. This original is definitely superior to the reformulated version, M7 Oud Absolu, that is part of a line, ""La Collection,"" of a handful of reformulations of vaulted classics, like Jazz. Certainly for an EDT, it\'s superlative in terms of power, along the likes of the 1980s powerhouses, or even some of the Mugler A*Men line. I\'m not blown away but I\'d still say it leans more toward a ""love"" than a ""like"" so I\'d be happy to have more than my decant but am also content to test my decant out while I test the market, though the market surely seems high for it. 8 out of 10', ""Bought the 2002 old formulation today from a dumb guy in $65 lol.

M7, Fahrenheit and Kouros are the holy trinity of classic manly fragrances and they perfectly describe the 3 types of men that come as what society defines as masculine. Diametrally opposite would be For Him by NR, Dior Homme and Chanel Bleu. While they are refined and classy, the first three are pure sex in a bottle. Talking about M7 means talking about Tom Ford. A guy I dont like as a designer, director a person, but highly respect as he is a money making machine. From his success at Gucci to YSL to the most genius marketing trick of all time - sponsoring Suits, he knows how to get people to buy his stuff, and his risks pay off. Thats what happened with M7. Introdusing oud to designer scents was a brave move and, even though I am not a fan of Arabian scents, hats down mr. Ford for doing it. I find nearly all oud scents to be similiar, differing only in sweetness. This one I can imagine myself wearing (while Gucci Intense Oud - never), but would never do so. It is sweet, warm and dark, extremely masculine, but bothersome and agressive. People will get offended if you overspray, so apply gently and ONLY in the winter, so you dont suffocate people around you. And put some pants on, dont be like mr. De Cuber', 'best!', '5/10', 'Original vs Reform vs Oud absolu I have always defended Oud absolu and i always will but my preference has shifted by a little, not much, to the original although i preferred Oud absolu for a looong time out of the trio. My preference has shifted a bit because i have discovered that the original is actually the ""most"" wearable out of the three although it is still to much set apart from the maintstream fragrances to be called a ""safe scent"". It certainly also is not that agressive, superbold, uber masculine chessst hair scent that some reviews give the impression to. I think the original and Oud absolu are closer to eachother then the original and the first Reform. Original: The original is the softest of the three. Some people describe this scent as powdery and for that also finding it ""feminin"". I know what they mean with the powderines but it is not really powdery. To me it is something else. I prefer to describe it as ""mellow"". It borders to powdery (the dryness of the amber might create such effect) but it is not and i don,t get that ""to feminin"" impression. I do get the slightly medicinal opening and the cherry/tobacco drydown and also the oud is certainly present but ""mellow"".  Performance: good, not to loud which is good Reform: If you prefer your oud really medicinal/gasoline like with a sweet undertone then this is the one you want. The oud absolu opens like this but it fades away. With this one the medicinal tone keeps going and in a way this one might also be the most ""harsh"" one out of the three. If you want a taste of the reform then you must try the opening of oud absolu. Performance: good, harsh almost loud.  Oud absolu: Maybe some called the original to powdery, to feminin, the oud to mellow, and the reform to harsh and to medicinal so why not mix these two together.. Oud absolu opens pretty medicinal but it softens. Instead it slowly makes room for patchouli,myrrh and mandarine which are pretty dominant in this one. Oud absolu is a nice, sweet, patchouli/mandarin Oud scent with a medicinal undertone. Oud absolu feels the most dense, maybe the boldest of the three but in a way also the most appealing one.  In the base/late drydown, this get\'s the closest to the original. Performance: good longevity, good projection, dense and sweet Personally i like them all three but it\'s not a love. Hope i added tiny value with my brief review.', 'Great fragrance. Its similar to M7 Oud absolu, but much fuller and deeper.', ""nothing special- fogy ...but with vintage- hypster-barbershop-cult-status.

I discovered it only last year after reading reviews at my leisure. Having been lucky on ebay I now own 2 full bottles of this. The all brown one (2002) and the reformulated version (2008). I actually bought the second one by mistake cause I didn\'t know then, how to distinguish between the 2 versions. Anyway, here they are now ! Having read about the ""groundbreaking usage of oud"" in this scent and having already owned and enjoyed scents ranging from Montale\'s Dark Aoud to Ajmal\'s Al Shams Special Edition, I was puzzled if not disappointed at first sniff. I couldn\'t detect any trace of oud in M7. Just a mellow, cherry cola, spicy, soft and warm sensation turning more insency and dark at drydown. I soon realized that I was judging this from the wrong perspective. M7 was not meant to be an Oud bomb back in 2002. M7 perfumers used Oud as an integral part of the whole formulation. More like a key cog-wheel but as part of a highly complicated mechanism. To cut a long story short, it took me several wearings to fully appreciate this scent. It is masterfully blended. It offers a short but fantastic opening to quickly turn ambery, woody, spicy, peppery, warm, not so sweet anymore with a delicate medicinal vibe. Fantastic and long lasting classy and dark drydown with woods and light smoke to my nose. M7 quickly turns to a rich skin scent but it possesses the magic power to reappear at random instances and drive my senses wild ! A fantastic addition to my collection. Now, as far as the reformulated (2008) version is concerned, well, in my opinion it is not bad at all. It is slightly harsher at the opening and it does dry down to a less mellow-thick scent. My guess is that the more striking differences between the 2 versions (should they exist) are for the expert noses - which is not the case with me ! The older version offers better longevity & sillage on my skin. Mesmerizing.  2002 : 9/10 2008 : 7.5/10', ""Without a doubt one of the most unique and truly addictive fragrances ever made. If the bottle has been stored properly it's fully powerhouse monster longevity and silage. I admittedly bought testers from the bay and they were nothing special. However when i got sealed bottle.

The opening, which is not the best is refreshing and very shy, with an agreement citrus nothing acids and quickly disappear, everything evolves into a temperate Woods agreement with oud and vetiver, soft, very pleasant and with a point of superb balance you could say chocolaty. Perhaps the note Oud here is not preponderant but accompanies the rest of the notes to mingle with them and make a refined and line cocktail anything resembling dirty and powerful Oud East but quite the opposite, is a soft Oud and very European.

My roommate in college had Kouros, and I would steal a shot every now and then. That woke me up to the impact a fragrance can make. Then 20 years later not wearing fragrances much, I walked into a frag shop and picked up a YSL M-7 Fresh; enticing to say the least. Now 3 years later I have a great colection of 40 best possible bottles for me, and I just caped it off with the two vintage formulations of M-7. I will update my review when they come in comparing the 2002 and 2008 versions. I have the vintage aftershave so I know I\'m going to love them. Aside from the modern day classic that they are, I love Amber, Vetiver, Oud, and in general woody, green, earthy frags. So this would be a winner for me if they just came out, without all the hype. The sweetness just balances the Oud. As in "" Amber Sultan"", the sweetness balances the Amber. Resins can be a potent note, when blended in a masterfull way, just makes a fragrance great, like with M-7. Just got my 2002 vintage tester. This could be right at home with Tom Ford\'s Private Blend collection. It is rich and luxurious as Amber Absolute or Tuscan Leather. Yes it\'s similar to M-7 Oud Absolu, but the Amber and Oud are richer and penetrate more with the vintage. It has a smooth vanelic sweetness, that takes the sharp edge off the Oud. It is intoxicating, beutifull, woody, like congac, or cream brulee, delicious woody scent. The performance is 70% that of those private blend frags I mentioned, so the high eBay prices are still a good value if compared to "" Private Blend"" colection. OK, my 2008, 2nd formulation came in. M-7 Oud Absolu should also be mentioned.  I\'m disappointed in the 2008 version of M-7 as it\'s very close, 90% to that of the current M-7 Oud Absolu.  So the 2008 has the Oud and darkness dialed down, but is a nice woody spicey scent with some of the smoothness of the original. I\'m thankful that we still have the current M-7 Oud Absolu. Sometimes a great fragrance is discontinued, never to be seen again. Now we have at least a quality reformulation that is reasonably close to the vintage. M-7 Oud Absolu is not inferior to the 2 nd, 2008 formulation, they are slightly different, and I think it\'s just a matter of preference which you may prefer. Oud Absolu has a great mid- drydown. Note: I found an inexpensive fragrance that is close to the original M-7, it\'s "" Bentley for Men Intense"". A current fragrance that is expensive, and is very similar to M-7, but better in performance, and has an added zesty quality, is Amouage "" Interlude Man"".

But sort of your grandmothers make up. The Oud on the opening is strong and pungent but quickly settles down to a semi sweet, fragrance. The opening is my favourite part at the moment. It also gives off this waxy vibe. I'm finding it to be quite feminine thus far. However I do enjoy it. I rocked it out on new year for the first time. Found projection to be quite weak as it died off within about an hour and became a skin scent. I sprayed heavily as it was very cold as I knew I'd be out for about 8 hours on the night.  The dry down is very reminiscent of Tom Ford Noir EDP which i already own. Think i prefer that to this. I can see why this got discontinued. Certainly not a people pleaser as such and most men would not appreciate this unless you're specifically into fragrances. It reminded my family of a certain 5p sweet I had when I was a kid called 'fruit salad' which i do pick up on.  I actually think Oud Absolu is much better than this. They definitely improved on the original idea. Oud Absolu is much darker and sweeter due to that cherry vibe. It's probably said a lot but it has that niche vibe, reminds me of Dior Leather Oud a bit. If they didn't discontinue this, would it sell? I doubt it. It was right to make it more wearable in the form of Oud Absolu.  I tested Oud Absolu again two days ago to compare having now smelt the original and as i said, i preferred that. Which i didn't expect at all. It's nice and very unique. Not all that long lasting, doesn't project like people say and the as far as I can tell not great sillage. The scent mutes to a soft sweet waxy/powdery makeupy smell. It portrays quite a unisex vibe. I feel Tom Ford wanted to portray some form of homoeroticism in this fragrance. Which i think it pulls off. I don't know why but i find it pretty cool and challenging because of that. But yeah, I haven't had any good or bad feedback on it yet. First night when i sprayed it on for New Year's Eve before heading out, I felt sexy as hell knowing i was going to challenge people's nostrils. Not one for the shy and better suits a dark almost gothic imsge. Scent - 8/10 Longevity - 7/10 Sillage - 6/10 Projection 6/10"", 'M7 by Yves Saint Laurent. M7 draws its intensity and sensuality in a unique olfactory approach, the alliance of noble and refined components and raw vegetable matter. Warm, the heart of M7 comes from a wood so precious, that in its purest form, it is said to be more precious than gold. It is the wood of Oud. Used in exceptionally high concentration in M7 perfume, oud wood merges with vetiver from Haiti to create the warm and intense wake characteristic of the fragrance. Seventh fragrance for men from the legendary French house, M7 is the expression of a new vision of masculine sensuality. This fresh, woody and sensual scent is the first masculine created by Tom Ford for Yves Saint-Laurent. Immediately recognizable. Intensely masculine, all in elegance, it is the most emblematic perfume of the man YSL. Intense and fascinating, the M7 man has a raw manhood and sensuality that make him as desirable as dangerous. A masterpiece by Tom Ford.', ""I have tried both M7 Absolu and the original which i own (Amber bottle). Yes, they are very much alike, but I find the longevity is lacking on absolu even though the smell is just about there. I found that some people deem the new absolu more wearable and not so potent. The new is straight to the drydown, the old takes a little longer to settle. Now let's talk about why the prices for the original seem insane. I like them both, but there is something about owning a piece of fragrance history, especially considering this is Tom Ford's first modern oud based fragrance and the introduction of oud to American masses. So the price of the old will automatically trump the new absolu being that Tom Ford's name is attached to the original which leads into the quality. The quality of the original is complete overkill, in fact, its the strongest EDT concentration i have ever owned. The original is said to have real oud oil as well while I'm not so sure if the absolu does. This kind of quality shows why a fragrance from the year 2002 is still purchased for more than retail; its not stale after all these years and is even comparable to one that was made just recently. In my opinion, 10 years from now the 23 year old original formula will still smell the same while the new absolu will likely go stale. Appreciate the original juice for the history, the artistry and quality made possible through the brilliance of YSL's creative director at that time, Tom Ford. Buy the absolu if you think the price of original is insane, but invest in the original if you must have the best."", 'i ordered a sample to see what the hype was about this... overhyped piece of shit. Is 99% similar to the new oud absolu', 'Does any women got attracted by it ??', ""M7's hypnotic masculine earthy sweet-cherry amber-oud opening is easily in my top 10 favorite openings of all time. The drydown is more of a woody/sawmill, not as impressive but still quite good. Isn't for everybody (sample first).

I asked to see it, then angels sang and trumpets blew: a 1.6 oz bottle of the original M7, opened (because was the last of its kind), with a broken corner (ultimately, the owner told me that the person who\'ve acquired it returned because it was ""broken""). In tears I said ""take my money"" and then I also found a bottle of the last batch of Emporio Armani\'s White For Him (which I love) and my happiness was complete! One of my signature fragrances is currently M7 Oud Absolu, which is beautiful, but there\'s a seriousness on the original juice, an incomparable darkness, misteriously provocative! A masterpiece that should be back in market. @alxkwst1996 I suggest a petition! lol', ""This is the definition of a before-it's-time release! Launched a decade almost before the oud craze, M7 was avant garde and just for that it deserves attention and because it smells so good, praise! I have the second version of M7 with only one ambery-side bottle. I heard this version is less oud-ish with a more focused amber note. Still what i get is a very middle-eastern night vibe, rounded with a modern parisian YSL accord:) Oud, amber mingle with a herbal rosemary, woods and create a bitter cherry liqueur feel. Linear yes, not always likeable, but with a presence and aura missing from most modern releases, so a good good thing. scent: 8/10 longevity: 7/10 sillage: 7/10"", 'Is it discontinued??', 'Barnyard fragrance, smells like sex.

But dont blind buy a bottle just because its a legend."", '@Midoh, well You can believe that if You want, but the truth is there was no high quality synthetic oud thought of at the time of the development of the M7. This smells like real oud because it is real oud, it doesn¬¥t matter whatsoever what this girl said at YSL.', 'Original vs Reform vs Oud absolu I have always defended Oud absolu and i always will but my preference has shifted by a little, not much, to the original although i preferred Oud absolu for a looong time out of the trio. My preference has shifted a bit because i have discovered that the original is actually the ""most"" wearable out of the three although it is still to much set apart from the maintstream fragrances to be called a ""safe scent"". It certainly also is not that agressive, superbold, uber masculine chessst hair scent that some reviews give the impression to. I think the original and Oud absolu are closer to eachother then the original and the first Reform. Original: The original is the softest of the three. Some people describe this scent as powdery and for that also finding it ""feminin"". I know what they mean with the powderines but it is not really powdery. To me it is something else. I prefer to describe it as ""mellow"". It borders to powdery (the dryness of the amber might create such effect) but it is not and i don,t get that ""to feminin"" impression. I do get the slightly medicinal opening and the cherry/tobacco drydown and also the oud is certainly present but ""mellow"".  Performance: good, not to loud which is good Reform: If you prefer your oud really medicinal/gasoline like with a sweet undertone then this is the one you want. The oud absolu opens like this but it fades away. With this one the medicinal tone keeps going and in a way this one might also be the most ""harsh"" one out of the three. If you want a taste of the reform then you must try the opening of oud absolu. Performance: good, harsh almost loud.  Oud absolu: Maybe some called the original to powdery, to feminin, the oud to mellow, and the reform to harsh and to medicinal so why not mix these two together.. Oud absolu opens pretty medicinal but it softens. Instead it slowly makes room for patchouli,myrrh and mandarine which are pretty dominant in this one. Oud absolu is a nice, sweet, patchouli/mandarin Oud scent with a medicinal undertone. Oud absolu feels the most dense, maybe the boldest of the three but in a way also the most appealing one.  In the base/late drydown, this get\'s the closest to the original. Performance: good longevity, good projection, dense and sweet Personally i like them all three but it\'s not a love. Hope i added tiny value with my brief review.', ""Tom Ford and I have the same taste in men, lol. We both like them hairy... Sorry guys, but M7 is unisex for me. It does not smell classic man, that's why I think a women can easily pull that off. Oud is such a strange smell, I never associate it with either sex; just Oud. The dry down is bold, but still unisex.  M7 is my cashmere sweater fume. There is a lot of fuss about cashmere sweater here, cashmere sweater there and we all don't want to hear it anymore, I know, but this one simply is: It smells warm, cosy, tender, stylish, unique.  Short great prolific time that was, when Jaques Cavallier and Tom Ford did perfumes together for YSL. Now those masterpieces are being one after the other discontinued. M7 will be next, I am quite sure.  I can live with the modern times, where 1000 new fumes are thrown on the market every year, most weak bad stuff, but I cannot live with great pieces of work are pulled from the market after short existence. That never happenend in the 20s-80s. Class withstood the test of time then."", ""This masterpiece is so difficult to review, I always find it difficult to explain that I particularly like them also because it is like dissecting my intimacy, it becomes a very personal thing and honestly I don't know where to start, but let's start with a similarity. Compared to modern perfumery, M7 is an orange spot in a sea of gray. It is certainly one of the most beautiful, original and fascinating perfumes I have ever smelled. I went in search of M7 when the hype wasn't as high as it is now, as soon as I smelled it, I immediately felt that it had something different than all the other perfumes. Today it has become almost impossible to find, and deserves all the hype surrounding it. To understand the essence in all its completeness it seems only right to start from the birth of this perfume. In 2002, Tom Ford, creative director of Yves Santi Laurent deals with the marketing of the seventh fragrance of the group, for this reason it is called M7, and he succeeds very well, the bottle, the mysterious amber parallelepiped is more striking than the nude used as a testimonial, a trusted creation. in Morillas and Cavalier, not two common noses. The thing that makes this perfume special is the introduction of real agarwood, never used before by Western homes. Today there are an infinite number of perfumes containing oud, but with the difference that in M7 the oud is real and not synthetic, and also blends perfectly with the ingredients, it does not want to be a perfume made mainly of oud and more. The opening of M7 is nothing short of overwhelming, aggressive, it is a paw of a tiger, medicinal, pungent spicy, dried herbs, mandarin rosemary and Haitian vetiver which then blend perfectly with amber, the round and woody oud, but not chewy as we are used to in modern perfumes. The perfume with the passage of time becomes sweeter, amber, dark, it lies gently on the skin remaining slightly powdery, deep, soft, modern despite being a 20-year-old perfume, it stimulates the senses, very versatile, and above all, elegant, masculine, oriental, absolutely three-dimensional, dense and damn sexy and long-lasting. And there is another reason why they like M7 so much, by now I was tired of perfumes, I had boxes full of the usual cheap perfumes that now appear like mushrooms on the shelves of perfumeries, M7 was my key to perfumes vintage / discontinued, it made me understand you can find emotions in the bottle even in old perfumes, finding old gems has given me a lot of satisfactions that not even the best niche could give me. I knew this review was going to be long and I'm sorry if I bored you. I close with a banality but it is the harsh truth, they will never make perfumes like this again.

I offered my arm hopefully to my wife (without telling her what it is) and she made a stink face: ""Yuck! Grandma\'s house - ashtrays!""  For some reason it appears my wife reads oud scent like ashtrays, which is what happened when I once applied Creed Royal Oud in her presence. A very great pity. (Although she liked the Creed after it thoroughly dried.)  I like this but I still prefer the Creed Royal Oud. It smells richer, more luxurious and less sweet. ------- Update: Today I obtained a sample of the original ""vintage"" M7... I do not understand the love for this at all. It is gagging. Too sweet, too medicinal, too much like cherry cough syrup. I haven\'t disliked the way I smell this much since I tried Jo Malone\'s Pomegranate Noir. I guess this is one instance where I prefer the reformulated stuff to the original!', 'So knowing that this was nearing extinction, I found this little rarity and purchased it as a blind-buy on the premise of the glowing reviews and the Tom Ford history behind it. I was hopeful this would be the YSL equivalent of Gucci Pour Homme (2003). And I was disappointed. From my perspective, this really turned out to be a very powdery concoction at its base and not at all what I\'d hoped given the presence of Oud as an ingredient. It now makes more sense that YSL has since taken a much different direction. So while this is likely to be a martyr review of the fragrance, I\'ll breakdown my own experience. It starts as a sharpness from the Orange/Bergamot/Rosemary, and it lacks the depth I would have suspected. The next step should have been Oud and Vetiver, and the Oud -- as compared to other Oud fragrances I currently own or have experienced -- seemed absent. Vetiver was only slightly more noticeable before this dissipated into base notes, which mostly consisted of a very powdery musk. Positively unisex, not a trace of masculinity within the entire composition. Where I\'d expected a fragrance composed off Oud and Amber, I\'d been left with powdery musk and an intro that smelled dead common to any other fragrance from the early 2000\'s.  Sorry, it\'s a miss for me, and my wife felt it was somewhat ""old-man\'ish"" even for her tastes -- totally off-putting for her as well as me.', ""2 me smells like dentist! yack don't like it :( But i do appreciate YSL... one of the best of course!"", 'Did not like this at all.

As the comment below me mentions, the notes from the givenchy website differ from those listed here. It might have been reformulated, although it does smell similar to when I smelled it back in the 2000's.  Like most have mentioned here, it isn't the most unique or attention grabbing scent. It's what you would expect from a clean woody freshie. However, there is a note or combination of notes that make this scent distinguishable and give it some character.  Very versitile, although ideal for office/university and casual use in spring during the day (also works in other seasons). Ideal age group is >25, althought that shouldn't deter you from using it if you like it.  Atomizer isn't that good and so is performance. Longevity isn't that bad, maybe 4 - 6 hours. However, projection is the real problem. It's ok (arms length) for the first 1 - 2 hrs, but sticks close after that.  It's a good fragrance at discounter prices, but not worth it at retail price.

Its fragrance was created by Ilias Ermenidis and Alberto Morillas and is classified as woody-fresh, while its beautiful bottle was designed by Pablo Reinoso. The creative concept tried to re-establish the more traditional codes of the brand, since the advertising campaign carried the slogan ‚ÄúThe gentleman is back‚Äù, in a double meaning game between the word and the iconic Gentleman perfume, from 1974. Until then, no one imagined that the company would invest in a new pillar, called Gentlemen Only, let alone the revival of the Gentleman pillar, in 2017. Givenchy Pour Homme's fragrance has top notes of cool grapefruit, mandarin, coriander, and violets, which make room for a body of lavender, davana, and vetiver, on a base of cedar and oliban wood, from which its fragrant gum is extracted. I don't know about you, but I find this fragrance incredibly sophisticated and timeless. I think the tagline was very well thought out as it brought back the gentleman from before (who bathed in mossy green foug√®res) and managed to stay modern for many years after its release. When touches the skin, Givenchy Pour Homme is slightly floral, citrusy, and very spicy. The coriander note tends to polarize opinions and because it is located at the top of the olfactory pyramid, something that was little discussed at the time, many men ended up not buying the product based on a blotter. But it doesn't take long, and that blazing aspect gives way to soft powdery violets and a beautiful lavender extract, which just doesn't go in a more feminine direction, thanks to the bitter scent of the davana. The evolution is subtle, the fragrance does not project too much, but the transmitted elegance lasts, and after a certain time, the woods begin to reveal themselves. The cedar is quite noticeable, the vetiver lends a little of that drier facet and the olibanum is slightly smoked, although a soft creaminess insists on exuding. The durability is good, but it hardly exceeds seven hours on my skin. Givenchy Pour Homme is undoubtedly a perfumery landmark in the early 2000s and a great example of an exquisite fragrance, which seems to have been idealized for work environments and formal occasions, even today. After all, not every company can afford to relax on dress code, build a video game space, and have a vast selection of donuts in the cafeteria. I just can't understand why they didn't follow up on this pillar, which has a legion of fans and, even so, took years to release a flanker after the second, in 2009."", 'This perfume is ready and present to accomplish all tasks in the office, parties, shopping, hiking, visits, meetings and work, day and night, in the heat of summer and the cold of winter, with all formal and casual clothes.

It will force you to stick your nose to the perfume or to the place you sprayed it on in order to enjoy its charm and beauty. Because of it, you will get a lot of admiration and positive comments.  The great genius Alberto Morillas succeeded in designing an amazing and attractive perfume with a scent that no one will be upset about, but you will find it multi-use, so much admired by women, that it can even be described as a seductive romantic fragrance. Young people will like it as well as mature men, the performance of the perfume in terms of longevity (4-6) hours on the body, and moderate (sillage and projection), the quality of the essential oil is not high but it is acceptable, and it will not affect the splendor of the perfume. My words and my description of a bottle of perfume made in 2016.', 'Absolutely loved this stuff in the mid-late 2000s. Was super rich & sexy & lasted a 6-8 hour workday no problem. Orange lavender creamy woods. Rich satisfying fresh & just sweet enough. Work with a tie or warm date night. Reformulation time. I will hold off rating until my bottle sits a few months, but this only reminds me of the pour homme that I used to know. Opening is similar & pretty good, Sillage scent is similar & brilliant, smelled up close it‚Äôs pretty synthetic. Not horrible but is that really the standard? Performance is bad. Open projects for 45min, skin scent 1-2 hours then gone. Smell sticks to clothes a little better & I haven‚Äôt tried moisturizing or overspraying in an attempt to boost performance. 4-5 sprays on skin from the crappy sprayer isn‚Äôt enough. Unless the bottle macerates some, I think this gets a meh. Unfortunate, because this was the frag I most wanted from my youth after being a 1 bottle kind of guy for 15 years. This was my one bottle for 2-3 üòú', ""An ok warm and spicy scent, but pretty average in my opinion. The bottle really is bad though - the sprayer got stuck and stopped working very soon after the purchase, and I had to break the plastic outer shell of the top to get it to function again. Shouldn't happen in this price range."", 'Heavier more creamy version of Blue Label. Its less fresh more serious scent in comparing with B.L. This one is spring days scent while blue label is meant to be a summer scent thanks to fresher more citrusy DNA. Pour homme and blue label are around 70% similar. 3.75 / 5 Age;+25 Moderate lasting and projection. Spring days. Casual.', ""I've bought this on and off since 2005. It's safe to say it was and possibly still is my signature scent. There is something almost liquoricey about it that I find addictive. I wear it mostly in the evening but it's very wearable for day too. It isn't overly strong like a lot of mens fragrances are. It's more subtle, classy and unique. That's why I like it and will keep coming back to it."", 'Was my signature scent for more than 7 years bottle after another never change it for any reason now days its a bit weaker but i still have one bottle just for after shower chilling at home situation and i still feel the same pleasure Smelling this unique alberto morillas creation', ""I was gifted this way back when it was a new scent. I seem to really have enjoyed it back in the day. Now it just seems synthetic and boring. I haven't worn this in a while and thought I'd try it out again. Still, not for me anymore. It's funny how time can change your mind, perhaps it will change back one day. It does last a while on my skin and people tend to like it, so there is that."", 'This is a beautiful and elegant fragrance. There is a delicate and delightful cream milk airiness to it even thought no milk or cream notes is listed. Unfortunately, it does not last long on me. My skin eats fragrance and it lasted about 3 hours before it disappeared and I am in a cool working environment.', ""Its an ok scent. I got it mainly because of Morillas. I should state up front that i'm deeply disappointed in the sprayer mechanism of this bottle. The top half of it is not well designed at all, and what comes out is akin to a burst of hand soap. Maybe i'm just not used to an EDT coming out that way. So opening is a nice citrus burst, but frankly just a bit tame. I do very much like the woody aromatic drydown though. Thats a pretty good work scent. Ive only just realised its got violet and lavender. But the lavender is very strong as a note but the violet is thankfully muted. I mean this is obviously about personal preferences here. But look, the scent itself seems to perform very weakly. Low sillage, its really a skin scent in 90 minutes. It does last, but just feels watered down, i had to check i hadn't got a fake. Scent is a manly burst but in a very 80s kind of way. I just think this scent belongs in a different era. What about you? What did you think about the bottle?"", 'Meh. Smells nice, generic, pleasant and safe. Perhaps would make a good affordable gift.  Reminds me heavily of Ferragamo Subtil PH, which to me is much punchier and more dynamic, despite being cheaper.  Plenty of more intriguing options for the price.', 'So this is only vetiver fragrance I like. Good job Givenchy.  P.s.  Vetiver is not the main note at all, but you definitely can smell it. This is an awesome warm weather fragrance with a fresh and pleasing mix of mandarine, vetiver and lavender. Longevity is not so good, but if you want an impressive arrival for a summer dinner, or when meeting with friends, good choice!', ""Can anyone clear me up? why does not this perfume appear but also Blue Label on the manufacturer's website?only the gentleman, gentleman only and Pi series appear listed on their official website.  I'm waiting for an answer if you can!"", 'Review of a 2002 bottle; unsure if this thing has been reformulated but for reference purposes this is an old bottle.  The top is all about sourness of grapefruit, mandarin, and coriander. It\'s an odd, citric, synthetic opening that is spicy/woody underneath. Clean smelling, pleasant enough. not really sweet at all. More of one of those clean, citric precursors to BdC that\'s good for younger guys, the office, etc.  I get average 4-6 hours of longevity with an hour or so of moderate projection. Not bad, at all for this sort of scent. About what I\'d expect.  A 7.25/10 for me. Nothing bad, nothing overly exciting. Compliments have come from folks around me of the ""oh, that smells nice, what is it?"" variety at times. Smells much like my memories of the early 00s.', 'One of my only blind buys and I love it. Got it at SteinMart in ‚Äò06 for super cheap and keep reordering it every year. Fresh, mandarin floral to start. Cedar lavender after dry down. Nice projection leaves a trail with just three pumps but not offensive in the least. Frequent compliments from coworkers and strangers over the years. This fragrance is sophisticated enough for nights out on dates or with friends but doesn‚Äôt smell like a real high end niche. This is an all purpose ‚Äúpeople-pleaser‚Äù. My Mom who hates perfumes and cologne likes this one. Very versatile. I wear it to the gym, work and just for myself around the house or on errands. Some say ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù I say safe. You won‚Äôt turn anyone off with this one. It does have a ‚Äúsex appeal‚Äù but in a gentlemanly way. If you know she‚Äôs looking for an animal maybe don‚Äôt wear this. It is kind of a unisex fragrance I guess. 7/10 longevity. 8.5/10 overall.', ""I remember smelling this fragrance at Bloomingdales in May 2002 because I needed something for a date I was going on that evening. I bought it and rocked that scent all summer creating some of the best times I've ever had. Around fall I ran out of the juice and went back to my Curve/Drakkar/Tuscany rotation. Here I am 17 years later wearing it on my wrist for the first time since I ran out of it and being instantly taken back to 2002 while bringing back memories I completely forgot about! Isn't it funny what memories pop up when you wear certain fragrances? It smells 98% the same....might be a little less potent. I remember going easy on the trigger when I wore this back then but this time around I think I can afford to spray 3-4 more than normal. I've had this on for a little over 2 hours with only one spray and it's still holding up well. I've never had an issue with longevity because of my skin chemistry so I don't think this will be any different. I'm not going to break down the notes in this one because I honestly don't know what it is I'm smelling and I don't really care! I'm just here to share how great this fragrance is and am glad I ran into it again! Edit: I managed to locate a new/never sprayed bottle from 2002. I wasted a few sprays on the back of my hand and it was missing the pungent top notes/opening but the essence was still there. Gave it a full wear and totally over sprayed! Was still lingering on my shirt the next day! Decided to give it another wear yesterday. Holy cow!! I guess it just needed to breathe! Opening was just like I remembered and projected all day!! I‚Äôm a happy guy!!!"", ""If it was masculine as other reviewers have noted then probably when it came out in early 2000's but now the new bottles are easily unisex. My wife likes how it smells on her. It's the most perfumey fragrance in my collection. Performance is average. Lasts as a skin scent for more than 6 hours however it projects only for maximum 2 hours.  I don't have a similar scent in my collection, Ungaro Man has been voted as one of the fragrance that it reminds people off however to me Ungaro smells totally different with a greenish tobacco scent which I adore. So to summarize, my opinion is divided with this one. I like how it smells as a scent but I don't think I like to smell it on me."", 'Mandarin orange, how do I love thee? I love thee with cedar...

Givenchy always makes great stuff however this is my number 1 for the house. Receive tons of compliments and will get you recognition when your at a meeting or on a date / public setting. Cologne won‚Äôt fix the person you are but it will enhance what your coming off as.

It is inoffensive and easy wearable in summer and spring. It opens with a blast of citruses with violet and coriander. After a few minutes you must stick your nose on your skin to feel it. So discreet but nice manly smell. It lacks of projection and the longevity is moderate (4-5 hours), nothing exceptional. I recomend it only for summer and spring for places that the scent must not be so loud.  The most distinguished notes I get are grapefruit, coriander, cedar, labdanum, mandarin-orange and vetiver.

But again, I would want to give it a benefit of the doubt by saying that it might react differently for everyone. I am glad that I have it in my collection (I can use it on the days when I dont feel like using other stuff) but I wouldn't recommend a friend to go for it. It's definitely a summer scent."", ""I've long been a fan of Givenchy Pour Homme and I've had it almost since it was first out. I do think it has lost a little power over the years but that's quite a common thing these days. On the immediate plus side, it is very versatile: day or night, winter or summer, work or romance, this one has them all covered (and that's rarer than you might think). I'd say it is moderate in it's strength and duration - usually when a perfume doesn't last long, it means the person is dehydrated or eating poorly or both, rather than the perfume being weak. Givenchy Pour Homme is subtle. It doesn't go around screaming its citrusy top notes or bombing you with woods or spices. It is a quiet pleaser. I like the cedar and the violet mixed in with the orange. There's something else in there that isn't in the fragrance notes, maybe blackberry, which I detect and keeps me intrigued. I like this a lot but I've never fallen in love with it. There's something missing which prevents it from becoming a bona fide masterpiece and I couldn't tell you what that might be. But it is very good. One day it will go the way of most perfumes and end up discontinued or ruined by a reformulation to meet the latest regulations. Buy a bottle now. If, like me, you have quite a number of colognes you wear, this one will last a long time because it's never the first one in your thoughts. I would compare it to the players in football teams on whom others forge a reputation of greatness. It's the quiet midfielder who retains and passes the ball like clockwork for others to launch attacks and score goals. When he's not there, things don't work quite as well. Oh sure, there are the flair players who score spectacular goals and this one will never be the player to make marketing men dream of riches, but, through all the noise and hype, you need a solid, reliable performer to hold everything together. That's Givenchy Pour Homme. Buy it and hold on to it. One day it'll be gone and it won't be quite as easy to replace as you might think. Edit: Alas, another discontinued Givenchy."", ""So, I can say the following about this one: I PERFECTLY understand why they have this particular one to be called (givenchy pour homme). The reason is, this perfume represents the TYPICAL smell of a man, a mature male to be more specific.

I think this perfume is very sensitive for the light, because I purchased on eBay already two bottles with this sour , old , bad stored smell, so make sure you have correct one.

This is undoubtedly a gentleman's scent, but the overall personality to me is late thirties onward. Just a personal preference, as others have noted, nothing too exciting about this scent. Just a simple, clean & natural classic. The aromatic greenish-tan scent is pungent and herbal at first, almost leathery -- this soon softens to a sweeter, barely recognizable citrus and vetiver suede. The woodsy spice of the cedar, coriander and vetiver dominate this scent, but the sweet floral and citrus notes round it out nicely.  Ideally suited for office wear and anything from business casual to corduroy.

The idea was to create a ""gentleman\'s"" scent but they were not specific on whether they were regarding a younger or an older gentleman. Either way, it is a mass market appeal fragrance perfect for any teen to a guy in his late 20\'s.  The top notes to this are fantastic and last quite some time. Imagine a fresh citrus floral. YES!!! Even the transition to the heart is great with the fruits, exotic spices, and florals creating something interesting, something with an old world feel blended with a modern take. The base is a big disappointment though. This had so much potential! The top and the heart had a great thing working but this just turns into another ambery, cedar based floral at the base. The funny thing is that amber is not even in the note breakdown but it is defintely there, or at least my nose picks up on it. If you like the amber and cedar in allure homme sport, then I highly recommend this one but if you want this scent with that edge I mentioned, I would recommend trying Hearts & Daggers from Ed Hardy, at least that one stays spicy throughout the scent life and keeps me entertained everytime I wear it. Oh, and True Religion Drifter and Givenchy Pour Homme have the exact same drydown.... the exact same, I thought I would add that.  Overall, this is a perfect, safe scent that is highly inoffensive and will get positive attention. Sillage is good for 1-2 hours then it becomes a skin scent, and the scent life is around 4-6 hours.

If you don't know then you have to try this one.  Being spicy and sweet at the same time can be enjoyable for some but not for me. The note of coriander way too strong. I can say that this fragrance has just one note: coriander. The coriander is the one which is spicy and the others bring their contribution not like different notes, notes that are supposed to be detectable, but like a mixture, a sweet one. Together this two are like a bomb that waits to be detonated. And when you detonate it (spray it on your skin) a war starts, oh man, and then I hope you have a close source of water near you because this one you'll make you puke.  A big stinker.

Analogues are: HUGO BOSS ""Selection"" (very close, but less complex), LaCoste Pour Homme (more cofee and vanilla), maybe Davidoff ""Silver Shadow Private"" (more bold and straight, less complex, more menthol).

Here I am 17 years later wearing it on my wrist for the first time since I ran out of it and being instantly taken back to 2002 while bringing back memories I completely forgot about! Isn't it funny what memories pop up when you wear certain fragrances? It smells 98% the same....might be a little less potent. I remember going easy on the trigger when I wore this back then but this time around I think I can afford to spray 3-4 more than normal. I've had this on for a little over 2 hours with only one spray and it's still holding up well.

Four and a half platinum stars.', ""Givenchy Pour Homme hit the market in 2002, starting a new pillar within the brand's masculine fragrance division. Its fragrance was created by Ilias Ermenidis and Alberto Morillas and is classified as woody-fresh, while its beautiful bottle was designed by Pablo Reinoso. The creative concept tried to re-establish the more traditional codes of the brand, since the advertising campaign carried the slogan ‚ÄúThe gentleman is back‚Äù, in a double meaning game between the word and the iconic Gentleman perfume, from 1974. Until then, no one imagined that the company would invest in a new pillar, called Gentlemen Only, let alone the revival of the Gentleman pillar, in 2017. Givenchy Pour Homme's fragrance has top notes of cool grapefruit, mandarin, coriander, and violets, which make room for a body of lavender, davana, and vetiver, on a base of cedar and oliban wood, from which its fragrant gum is extracted. I don't know about you, but I find this fragrance incredibly sophisticated and timeless. I think the tagline was very well thought out as it brought back the gentleman from before (who bathed in mossy green foug√®res) and managed to stay modern for many years after its release. When touches the skin, Givenchy Pour Homme is slightly floral, citrusy, and very spicy. The coriander note tends to polarize opinions and because it is located at the top of the olfactory pyramid, something that was little discussed at the time, many men ended up not buying the product based on a blotter. But it doesn't take long, and that blazing aspect gives way to soft powdery violets and a beautiful lavender extract, which just doesn't go in a more feminine direction, thanks to the bitter scent of the davana. The evolution is subtle, the fragrance does not project too much, but the transmitted elegance lasts, and after a certain time, the woods begin to reveal themselves. The cedar is quite noticeable, the vetiver lends a little of that drier facet and the olibanum is slightly smoked, although a soft creaminess insists on exuding. The durability is good, but it hardly exceeds seven hours on my skin. Givenchy Pour Homme is undoubtedly a perfumery landmark in the early 2000s and a great example of an exquisite fragrance, which seems to have been idealized for work environments and formal occasions, even today. After all, not every company can afford to relax on dress code, build a video game space, and have a vast selection of donuts in the cafeteria. I just can't understand why they didn't follow up on this pillar, which has a legion of fans and, even so, took years to release a flanker after the second, in 2009."", 'This is an alluring scent.

Good compliment puller for the rare occasion I wear it (gotta conserve it here in the US)."", 'A very special scent that you will understand after using it that it has not become a classic for nothing. A stylish, comfortable summer perfume that all ages will love. It entered my collection, and as soon as I finished it, I immediately bought a new one.', ""For many, this is the classic beach scent. Not for me. The rosemary doesn't fit into a fresh scent at all. The selection of cultivated scents reminiscent of sunscreen and the beach is huge. So I don't need this one."", 'Lasts 7-8 hours on skin and days on clothes. Sillage is moderate, which is ok, because if it were to be stronger it could cause nausea to some people.

If you‚Äôre a guy, who‚Äôs young, athletic but also creative, this could be for you. If you‚Äôre a woman, tomboy, androgynous (or non-binary) , check this out! This could be for you, too.

I wore it so hard every day and collected a lot of good memories. I enjoyed it, but I won‚Äôt repurchase. I let it go. It smells very fizzy, orange candy like, lemony, watery and very fresh. The drydown also has a powdery sweetness. It showed a different face every time I wore it.', 'Jil Sander Sun is literally bottled fun in the sun. Very sunny, fruity, slightly sweet, young, uplifting and vibrant. A perfect summer fragrance for a young and urban man.', ""My to-go summer perfume by the beach as a woman who loves to play volley or any type of sport on sand with friends. It's fresh, with a nice citrus outcome, but in the same time, it has the confidence of a men's fragrance.  Because it is on the fresh, natural side, the longevity is not the best, but it does the job done in the hot summer days. And I find not so sweet like the perfumes for women from Jil Sander, they are too choking for me. Definitely my favorite, on the budget perfume for summer."", ""I really enjoy this one. Personally I use this as my summer fragrance, but this can be used as an all year fragrance aswell.  It is something unique, but basic. I was not a fan of it when I got it last year. But for this year's summer I started wearing it and I got a lot of compliments. I was amazed at how long it lasts on my skin (around 6 hours, even on very hot days). What took me by surprise even more, is that it popped of my skin very well. People in a 2 meter radius could scent it around 2 hours after spraying it.  Overall, it's a very pleasant scent, and a perfect gift for someone, making it a good summer blind buy."", 'I‚Äôm about to sound like I don‚Äôt like this But I do: Though this is a Basic Boy scent, this is DarkFruits Twitter, this is Chest, Arms, Abs and Chicken legs, this is super tight jeans and that weird curly flop thing they style hair into. This drives a midsized car, has a job at some bland office in some nondescript business park, Tesco Meal Deal lunch, some small car ‚Ä¶, whatever! This is basic and there is nothing wrong with basic every now and then, sometimes nothing beats a bowl of cornflakes or a slice of toast.

Got this as a birthday present bought on an airport. Nice spring summer scent and I even think I could get away with it in the early autumn. Not sweet at all pleasantly spicy on me. Mostly rosemary and in a good blend with nutmeg. Someone below mentioned the 90th and I can in some way agree but in this case it is the better part of the 90th. I can\'t sense any cardamom or sandalwood but there was a hint of citrus at the start but it blended in to the spices quite fast. My bottle must be excellent because I sprayed myself around 8 in the morning and I can still get ""waffs"" of the scent now at 9.30 pm. Lucky me!', ""Good stuff on the cheap. Some of my friends described it as a refined version of some Axe fragrances. Although it's really fresh, it can still work on a night out."", 'To bad that there‚Äôs not aan EDP on this !!', ""This is a perfect beach fragrance for me. Lovely bergamot limy opening that goes into a spicy heart. De drydown is nice and sweet with light aquatic notes that combines greatly with the smell of beach and sea. There is a bit of a synthetic feel in the frag and the longevity is not great. But for the price it‚Äôs very pleasant. Also great after showering when you've rinsed off all the sand, sunlotion and salt with a lemon soap or fresh shower gel. Let the sun shine!"", 'Smells like a high end sunscreen in the best way possible. If you live anywhere coastal, this is a no brainer blind reach. Interesting enough to know it‚Äôs a designer fragrance but simple enough to not over think it. Must own year round for anyone within 3 miles of a coastline.', 'What a wonderful scent. I go to school in Houston and let me tell you this place is a hot and humid mess. This fragrance meshes so well with this climate. I am no expert in fragrance notes but I can tell you that it gives me the vibe of a sexy and fresh sunscreen. Imagine a model laying by the pool side after a swim basking in the sun after applying some fancy sunscreen. That is the image that this fragrance evokes for me.', 'A well blended lime/bergamot and mild cardamom/cinnamon combination. It‚Äôs a fresh yet slightly warm and masculine opening. It stays herbal/spicy for a while. Not groundbreaking but the quality and execution are there. Easy to wear, most suitable for autumn/spring/winter. Unlike other reviewers, I don‚Äôt think this is a summer fragrance but I guess if it says Sun it has to be lol.', 'So happy to have this again. Wore this for a summer when I was younger and had forgotten how nice it is.  Truly a summer scent, for warm and hot days only and unique to anywhere outside of Europe.', ""A summer classic! In some countries still a hidden gem. Technically this scent would be great for summer parties, but due to the rather weak performance, i'd recommend it for summer dates at the beach etc and close encounters in general. If you still wanna rock it on a party just take a decant with you and keep respraying during the night."", ""Jil Sander Sun.... yes, summer fragrances DO NOT have to smell like a gazillion clones and flankers and extensions of Cool Water and friends pumped up with Calone.  There are cold summer fragrances such as Davidoff cool water, airy summer fragrances such as Giorgio Beverly Hills Wings, soft summer fragrances such as Antonio Puig Agua Brava Azul, dry summer fragrances such as John Varvatos Artisan Blue. Jil Sander Sun is the WARM summer fragrance. It smells like a suntan lotion boosted up by nice soft spices. When it came out it had good longevity but the blend is a little weaker nowadays but also less expensive. Walking near the water in La Jolla, Kiama or Westerland in shorts and a linen shirt...it's perfect for that...."", 'This is a very impressive ""proto-aquatic"" designer scent - in that it\'s how aqua scents used to be structured before the introduction of calone. It\'s bright, aromatic citrus, spiced ever so slightly with the cardamom and nutmeg and grounded with a laundry-type musk note and a very, very light touch of sandalwood. Thoroughly refreshing. If you can\'t find a bottle I\'d say the closest thing in my own collection is Le Male Eau Fraiche, though that one is sweeter and more floral than this is. The components here work VERY well together and are extremely well-balanced, such that none of them stand out too dramatically, they are all part of a well-written symphony. It should not surpise me that Beatrice Piquet had a hand in this, she was amazing and is sorely missed.', ""Bought this as part of blind haul and was mildly impressed. Just like the female version of Sun this evokes a strong beach association with me, though the scent isn't your typical citrussy, marine freshy. Instead it projects images of a summer afternoon after a hot day at the beach. The mix of sweet sunscreen, sand, dried seawater, a little bit of BO (not unpleasant though) and the sensation of the burning sun are encapsulated neatly into one sensory package. As stated by many the performance is extremely weak. Hardly any projection and a 2-3 hour longevity on my skin. So for me this is a scent to take with you and re-apply or mix with other low performers throughput the course of the day. And for the price (<20 Euro for 100 ml) this is a pretty safe blind buy if you're not expecting wonders. Still recommend it though."", 'Top summer scent! You feel the sun. Amazing', ""A great underrated summer fragrance with a brilliant olfactive recipe, based on low performances, but this doesn't matter so much when the smell of this is sooo sooo good! Smells like the sand burned by the sun on a tropical beach! A great typical summer concoction."", ""It's an awesome fresh scent. But it's VERY weak, no performance whatsoever."", ""This is a CK One clone pure and simple. It's very strong (unless you bought fake) and should not be over-sprayed unless you enjoy headaches caused by its sickly oversweet intensity. It is also purely linear in its delivery. There's no change at all in its dry down and the subtlety of notes indicated here are non existent. Put simply, it has no complexity, and smells the same throughout the day. It's also a very feminine fragrance, so people who are still binary in their masculinity should avoid it like the plague. Whatever you do, do NOT blind buy this fragrance. Even at its low price, unless you are in love with CK One, it's a waste of money and you'll be stuck with a very expensive air freshener that will literally take years to get rid of. That said, CK One fans will adore it. It has good a 6 hours performance and moderate projection. Remember, every fragrance reacts differently according to individual skin chemistry, and this review is just one person's opinion. That's why most YouTube influencers are not your friends when it comes to fragrance recommendations. What they tell you they love, could end up being an expensive mistake for you."", 'great summer cologne. not the best in performance. still a great value under 30 dollars. I work outdoors so it lasts me between 2-3 hours on my skin (7 sprays).', ""Given the listed note breakdown, I guess I am smelling the Bergamot up front in this fragrance. While it is not an unpleasant clean orange smell, I find it less than I expected. The softness of this fragrance suggests that this is definitely a unisex scent, leaning female. It is a weak performer but nice for short outings that don't last more than a couple of hours."", 'This is literally the weakest fragrance I ever tested. It has a spicy orange scent,but it lasted only 30 minutes and I used all of the sample which was about 10 sprays. A real disappointment', ""This fragrance is a wonderfully fresh scent that is definitely a little bit unisex. It's a very clean smell but the powdery aspect gives me a more feminine impression at times. However, this is not off-putting in the slightest; I think this makes the fragrance perfect for a Summer evening date or morning sunrise-very inoffensive, clean but not brash."", 'A little bit of spices, a little bit of syntetic orange and a very very heavy dose of musk. Smells amazing  and fresh in the opening, but unfortunately you end up smelling only musk because it is a fragrance that costs $ 30', 'This is an absolutely amazing scent. It reminds me of a warm summer morning sitting on the beach watching the sun rise and looking out on a beautiful orange sky. I really recommend this if you like fresh scents.', 'It‚Äôs a very loner scent, with a lot of bergamot with rosemary and a pinch of sandalwood and cardamom. A very decent fragrance!!!', ""I really like the opening of this fragrance.It's strong little citrusy and that bergamot , I'm in love with that the dry down is very similar to mont blanc legend night. I'm currently testing the longevity of this fragrance but after 5 hours it sits close to the skin.I believe in the summer time it would be grate and can be very safe for the summer night dates not to over powered but powdery sweet and really easy to like"", ""I think this is a great copy of CK1... not very enthusiast, that's all!"", ""Great cheapie!

Normally it wouldn‚Äôt be something I‚Äôd go for but at the moment it seemed refreshing so I figured why not. Especially that I was so used to wearing bleu noir by narcisso Rodriguez and that was too intoxicating for summer. Anyway point is, it‚Äôs refreshing, polite and easy to wear if you don‚Äôt know what to get for summer. Performance is pretty average but it does the trick. I never felt the need to buy another bottle.', 'It has no resemblance to Amouage Reflection Man at all, the reviewer below needs to get his nostrils tested.', 'The opening to me was very fresh orangey sort of. Then after about 1-2 hours when i smelled my arm, it smelled very similar to amouage reflection man for some reason. Bought as samples', ""Nice fragrance. Fresh and a bit spicy-sweet. Cardamon is the main note on my husband's skin. It is pleasant and soft. The opening reminded me of Luna Rossa Sport. I don't find it similar to Mandarine and Cardamon from 4711, Sun Men is way more gentle. What more can i say? it is not unique but it is inoffensive and well done. It is ok for the price. Try it if you are looking for a summer scent that is a bit more sensual. Final note: 7/10"", 'Sun Men starts as fresh and summery scent (with obvious sunscreen lotion note) and later turns into a rather sweet-cardamom skinscent resonating with some kind of nostalgic early 00s vibe that lasts several hours on my skin, there is some sweet mandarin accord that reminds me of Laguna Homme by S. Dali... Edit: Drydown is borderline feminine, but it is that kind of femininity I can easily appreciate and like (not just ""toxic femininity"" of some other scents) although I am not into sweet scents, this one is fine and for its price it is ok: 8/10. Song: ATB - The Summer', 'Definitely too sweet, terrible performance. 1h projection,then becomes skin scent', ""First impressions on my new 125ml bottle; Cool frosted glass and bright orange cap so will this be an icy fresh citrus fragrance?  Not quite. It's not going to give you that icy fresh blast needed on the hottest days but it's certainly most suited to the warmer seasons. With it's soft spicy twists Sun Men is a little different from the many 'summer' scents I've tried thus far.  The opening is extremely bright and quite strong with a calone note typical of many summer freshies/aquatics, I guess this could be a bit much for some. The scent soon dies down to become a paradoxically familiar (some would say the G-word - generic) yet somehow unique fresh spicy aromatic.  So far, from a fairly quick test I've had poor performance on my skin but excellent on clothing (still radiating strongly 12+ hours from my hoodie sleeve), which I guess is good for a warmer season fragrance. This wouldn't appeal to those seeking natural cologne type scents but someone looking for a unisex, modern (synthetic) casual fragrance with a relaxed, feel-good vibe and uniquely alluring spicy accord should check it out. I get the feeling Sun Men may suit summer evenings or warm overcast days better than the intense high heat (French summer). Update: Four days since spraying twice on my sleeve it is still very noticeable without having to put my nose right on it, so it works remarkably well on clothing for a 'fresh' fragrance. Second update; this stuff lasts forever on clothing!"", 'Recommended to me by a friend Batch number H8 03627091133. Creamy, sweet and spicy!... Quite an unusual scent, for me a massive thumbs up...

Another frag that gives me a headache."", 'That scent is one of my absolute favorite scents of all time. It smells not even like summer, it smells like hot summer and beach, or like skiing vacation and sun cream. But in every case it smells like what you think when you read the name ‚Äúsun‚Äù. This scent is great, but there are several weak points. First of all the performance. It is really bad. I think you can drink a bottle of this juice and take a bath in it and after one hour nobody will smell it on you. So it doesn‚Äôt matter how good the scent is, if you couldn‚Äôt smell it, you couldn‚Äôt count it as a real fragrance. The second weak point is the softness of the scent. You can wear it every day. Especially in your free time. But you wouldn‚Äôt smell like a real boss. The ladies might like the smell, but they wouldn‚Äôt drop their pants for this scent. The price is very nice on the first sight. But if you know the performance, the price couldn‚Äôt be higher. After all this is a cheap scent in every point, which smells more than nice.', '5/10', 'Tried this. Compared to Bvlgary Aqva Marine and smell wise, they are close, same fresh oceanic vibe. But Aqua Marine lasts way less than this. This has a beautiful bergamot note, that is mostly linear from start to finish, mixed with some sandalwood at the end but it keeps going and going. It is so easy to wear, so summery, so non offensive. The first thing I thought was... this is what I would love to smell in a hot summer day in the bus, at work, in the city, crowds...

If I had of had the chance to sample it before hand then I probably wouldn\'t have bought it. It smells to similar to individuel or presence by mont blanc with slight hints of forever by moschino. Now, with all of this complaining out of my system, this is a great fragrance. It is light and inviting while maintaining a slight masculine air. It has a nice clean quality that is never overwhelming which makes this a PERFECT fragrance for spring and summer. The cardamon and nutmeg give it that extra depth that it desperately needed, and gives it a slightly unique quality. Do I recommend Sun Men? Yes, I undoubtedly do! Of course, that is only if you don\'t have fragrances with similar qualities and rundowns. But, Sun Men just doesn\'t reach the level of the fragrances I mentioned earlier.

I have a fond memory of testing this and the bottle highly advertised from my teen years in 2002 right when it launched- so I went ahead and tracked down a short ingredient list bottle to make sure it was as close to 2002 as possible (bottle is a 2004). Anyways - Just reunited with the scent - interesting. Not quite as orange as I remember yet very citrusy. Almost like a sharp mix of lemon and grapefruit with hints of orange behind it - overall the citrus aroma is rather undistinguishable and rather generic in nature.  Its sweetness is somewhat apparent - lightyears from being anything close to a gourmand. No- no distinguishable cinnamon, nor nutmeg, nor cardamom. Also a generic mingling like the citrus top is done. In 2002 compared to what was out there I could see people intrigued and calling this sweeter than other freshies and seeing it as a trendsetter. This sort of is a hybrid of a spring scent (aromatics) summer (the citrus) and fall (the sweeter spices). Overall though - I remember why I never personally got around to getting a bottle as its an aroma that is an array of notes you cannot pinpoint per say - which is a tactic that is kind of annoying in perfumery. In fact if anything - its sort of a pleasing ambroxan type scent. Very sauvage like without that nasty scratchy fake feeling you get from modern ambroxan. So in comparison - I could be nice and call this the luxury top tier of synthetic ambroxan type freshies. Maybe the wood combo is giving this effect and as to why i'm not having ambroxan chemical symptoms?  Did I mention I absolutely hate spraying this? lol - Possibly the most awkward sprayer ever as your atomizer you press on is literally the bottom of the bottle that you press upward to release the juice from the top - still cool though In modern trends - not much you can do with this - its a casual daytime / sexy sporty scent with some slight playful notes slipped in as a marketing tactic to sell the trendy new ball bottle. It is a very sexy fresh scent though - the more I smell it I just kind of think of jocky sexy guys from early 00s. This is certainly better than the square bottle Hugo Boss orange scent- that one is so nasty- its like apples and vinegar to my nose- least the ball bottle is somewhat orange-y. Its almost sort of feminine the longer it lingers on my skin - again - this is a very strange linear fragrance that sort of leaves you jumbled - even if you have an experienced nose like mine.  Try it! its worth adding to the casual daytime sporty dumb grab shelf. Don't expect too much from this though- It's LITERALLY just a few steps above an edc mall scent and literally is just Generic citrus- sweet violets - pink pepper."", 'Great scent all around.

I wore this all during the early 2000's and it was before I was nearly as deep into the hobby but I still after all the scents I have smelled I still hold this one close to my heart. Impossible to dislike this. I picked up new bottle after not having it for over 15 years. I even found one in the ball bottle. The orange is very synthetic but in a good way. Like the McDonalds orange drink compared to real orange juice. Its not as real but somehow smells better because of all the added sugar. The dry down blends the creamy orange and cardamom into musky woods so nicely. Longevity is decent. Projection is average. Great for spring and fall daytime casual usage.

Hugo boss caught on to the complete marketing mess and removed the 'orange' title from the square bottle- esp since it smells NOTHING like oranges!

Finally, the lotion settles down eventually with a creamy aroma that is soothing, upscale and gourmand (a delicious and rightfully spiced pumpkin pie comes to mind, or a milk-based sweet orange-cardamom popsicle made with premium ingredients). Somewhat long lasting because I spray four times early in the morning at 8am, and by 2pm it still lingers in my skin and clothes. Do not expect a bomb or an attention-grabbing eau de toilette; In Motion is subdued and elegant. Decent projection. Remarkably versatile for any time of year (Spring and Autumn being the best).

Hugo made such a stupid mistake on this that they actually REMOVED the orange name from its title and call it now 'Hugo Boss Man'. I saw their new packaging at TJ Maxx- in fact I bought it at the maxx and then returned it- its so bad lol.  Hugo Boss boss in motion (Which SHOULD have orange in the title) is gorgeous.

It is part of the Boss Orange division, which represents a more casual line of clothing within the brand portfolio. This division eventually spawned a new pillar of fragrances when Boss Orange for Women was released in 2009. The male version only hit stores in 2011. Boss in Motion meant a lot to the brand as it had a significant sales success, even higher than the last men's fragrance launched at the time, which was Hugo Dark Blue, in 1999. Its oriental fragrance was perfect for the style of the time and its jovial appeal conquered countless fans, besides bringing a new approach to the masculine perfumery of Hugo Boss, stagnate since Boss Bottled (1998). The fragrance features notes of sweet orange, basil flower, bergamot and violet leaves, in the output. Then, the body brings warmer notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, and pink pepper. And to finish, the base has notes of sandalwood, vetiver, woody accord and musk. The perfumer was Domitille Michalon, who is not a very well known name in the field, but has already been involved in creations for Lacoste, Gr√®s and even Dior. It is classified as oriental-foug√®re, but in my opinion, it behaves, indeed, as an oriental-fruity scent. It is juicy, invigorating and at the same time, it is hot, as the Orientals of that time managed to be. On my skin, the fragrance does not evolve much, remaining with a pleasant smell of orange, which is not citric - contrary to what many think - because it is balanced by the sensuality of spices. It reminds me of the smell of orange cake baking in the oven. Boss in Motion does not project much, but it has a good duration, remaining between six and eight hours in a consistent but intimate way. It combines with professional environments, does not target a specific age group, but conveys joviality. It is good for romantic encounters or occasions where it is not seen with good eyes to wear very impacting perfumes. Its bottle is praised to this day, but was not completely innovative at the time, as Paco Rabanne had done something similar in 1999 when launched Ultraviolet Eau de Parfum. In any case, Boss in Motion is undoubtedly a watershed in the masculine perfumery of the brand and represented a sure kick-off at the beginning of the millennium."", 'I had this but had to give it up on account of it just smelling too much like orange creamsicle that doesn‚Äôt really go anywhere, complexity-wise.

I think you should buy it if you re a man with fine tastes. If this pro e that i m wrong about sillage, for sure i will buy it again. a fast re edit : folks ....both,longevity and sillage : WEAK :(  I'm so upset,when I thought I finally found a scent on my taste ...  the juice is PERFECT !!! but that`s not enough man,like i said ,i don`t want to be smelled from far away,but to be there.

One of my colleagues was standing around me and still smelling something. Then I realized that she smelled my perfume. My intuition was correct. She told me that I have a very nice fragrance. And I was something like: wow, thx. After that, she obviously wondered what a perfume it is. The idea is that this perfume shows its value at a wet temperature, because in my country the humidity is low. And yes, I can say that I also felt the perfume persist. So I apologize, but ready, that's the final decision. It is worth buying and worn only in the cold, wet seasons, not the summer. The end of the story."", ""This is the first cologne i ever owned!

Sure, it was released way back, and Boss Orange is the new king. But this is worth a shout. Fresh spicy orange on initial application (and it really is an awesome orange), drying-down into a less potent version of itself, bringing forth the musk, vetiver and woody elements.

Usually on hump day I reach for something with a bit of pronounced note thing going on (Aramis Havana of late) to help me ease into the downward part of the week heading to Saturday. Today given my ‚Äúdiet‚Äù, I tore open a box containing Boss In motion that I received free with a pair of sunglasses I bought in an airport a few years ago. From memory it was pleasantly orangey but the joys of air travel is that 5 minutes after I board a plane I can‚Äôt smell a thing so other than the initial notes I had no idea what to expect.  First impression was that it was indeed a fuzzy orange with a little bit of spice. Quite invigorating! By the time I had walked to the train station it had settled into an almost wintery mulled drink sort of scent but rather weak‚Ä¶kinda like being half a mile away from a German winter market where you get faint whiffs but not the full on smell of spice or burning wood. Now after 3 hours or so it‚Äôs moved to the base of mild musk, light spice and clean wood. More sandalwood than vetiver. All in all apart from the initial fruit I‚Äôm a bit uninspired really. Far from unpleasant but nothing to really write home about.

Highly recommended!!!  This was the first motion that came out in 2002, I wore it all summer long. 12 years later I had the urge to pick up a bottle. I bought a bottle this morning and I wore it during work. A really attractive aroma of orange comes through making it perfect as a summer fragrance. The added notes of nutmeg, cardamom and red pepper gives it a real attractive powdery/spicy aroma. The orange note is as true to what orange smells like.

My final throughs, Out of all the motion collection's, this one tops the list being #1. I have several frag's with orange being the main note.

I don't get the Orange scent as much as I was expecting, though it is a Top Note so I guess that is why. I find that I am picking up on the Cinnamon, Sandal Wood, and the Musk a lot more than anything else. This perfume also smells 'Powdery' to me as well. I am not sure if that is because of the combination of ingredients or if it is how the perfume is reacting to my skin. This is a nice perfume and I enjoy it; however, it isn't something I would wear for flash or to make a statement. It seems like an everyday-wear perfume in my opinion.

I don't get the Orange scent as much as I was expecting, though it is a Top Note so I guess that is why. I find that I am picking up on the Cinnamon, Sandal Wood, and the Musk a lot more than anything else. This perfume also smells 'Powdery' to me as well. I am not sure if that is because of the combination of ingredients or if it is how the perfume is reacting to my skin. This is a nice perfume and I enjoy it; however, it isn't something I would wear for flash or to make a statement. It seems like an everyday-wear perfume in my opinion. It feels very safe and quiet to me. I would recommend this fragrance to be worn at work or someplace where sublety is key.

Reapplication becomes necessary‚Äîoften as frequently as every 15 minutes‚Äîto maintain its presence. I so wish it had more staying power.

Such a desirable scent! Despite the underwhelming performance I am considering buying a bigger bottle when my 10 ml runs out.', 'I have always called it ""The cutie"" among all my colognes.

Light and airy, it definitely reminds French style of perfumery, generally Western style. It is very nicely built perfume. It has complexity and smoothness, yet it\'s fresh, elegant and inoffensive. The project is definitely not focused on the theme of mass appeal.  Among raw materials, there are certain citrus and white floral notes coming through, you can definitely point them in the opening. I would think about Hedione or its more refined version Hedione HC, Florol, Magnolan and other soft white florals, lot\'s of Terpenes, surely Linalool, Ethyl-Linalool, Linalyl Acetate and tens of others potentially. Interestingly, I imagine a watery note in the opening too.  It dries down more to a creamy woody base, were you can pick up creamy texture of Sandalwood and dry woody notes. It seems, that this perfume stays light and fresh through all its duration, everything is well put together and overall profile of a fragrance is very smooth.  I imagine it as a daily signature, that really fits in a professional environment. (Office, conferences, clinical environment) Elegant, ""go to work"" perfume.  Do I like it?  I am not sure, is it my favourite Sandalwood olfactive interpretation, but objectively, it smells very nice.  It doesn\'t seem to be a monstrous projector, it\'s more like an intimate fragrance with good amount of naturals. If you like elegant, complex, yet fresh perfumes - it is something I recommend to try.', ""The listed top notes and the lavender lift me to heaven at the opening.... Is this my signature scent?  But before too long it fades to skin, where it smells like a stale sugary distant memory. On my shirt it smells a bit too like the generic bubblegum fragrances for young men.  And yet, it's got a definite mature, timeless, sophisticated, gentlemanly quality. So I'm a bit confused. Trying it out again, day 2. Beautiful. It's sort of in the same vibe as Guerlain Heritage edt. I'd probably opt for that. I almost love this one more, for its mood boost; but H has much better longevity.  There's an intense version which costs ¬£185, for 90ml (i think) and scores well for longevity in reviews. It's meant to be a very similar apart from the better performance"", 'only my perfume lasts 15 min?', ""Fresh and grassy to begin with, it expands into a medley of spices (most notably cardamom and nutmeg), and finishes with a strangely sweet, creamy olibanum/sandalwood/musk. Some note separation; but questionable longevity and projection. The performance is a singular flaw of my purchase (Batch WMB21454-2) from late 2024. The concentration of oils seems truly parsimonious and ought to embarrass Floris. Patrons invested in the Floris culture (at least to an extent) are likely familiar with traditions of 'correct attire' and that a gentleman's scent mustn't ever be intrusive. In this respect Eau de Santal is assuredly discreet ‚Äì just ridiculously so. As much as I like this classy EdT, it is flawed. It needs more oils, Floris! More oils, I say!!"", 'This fragrance evokes the essence of an oriental fougere, with a classic and timeless scent profile. The opening top note of grass carries a subtle bay leaf quality, adding an aromatic freshness. As the fragrance develops into the mid and dry-down stages, the rich lavender and smooth sandalwood blend seamlessly, with a hint of vanilla providing a creamy texture that adds warmth and depth.

Hopefully the packaging is the only thing that has changed.', 'For a perfume released in 2002, it is very classic. Yet I think Floris successfully modernised the barbershop concept here in a manner that ensures it will always have a place in perfumery.  There are similarities with barbershop classics such as Old Spice and Tabac, yet it is more modern and probably it is vetiver that gives it a grassier or at least fresher feel despite all the warm spices in there. Can be used the year around in my opinion, great morning routine scent.', 'it smells like they make two bottles of one perfume and add water, actual for floris out of 5 perfumes only 2 are good', 'Who TF said this reminds them of Sa-vag elixir!!

The deep drydown is mostly tobacco-y, incense-y, peppered sandalwood, while still holding on to the freshness of the topnotes. Floris Santal boasts an authentic classic 90s men's fragrance vibe. It smells luxe and dimensional, and oh so masculine. A lovely composition any fragrance enthusiast and nostalgia seeker will appreciate. Not your basic, boring dill pickle sandalwood. None of that at all! So beautifully blended and well thought out. A fragrance that will not suffocate those around you if you over spray. It's fresh, then warm, friendly, and refined.

In the opening you get a sharp burst of cardamom, lemon, and bitter grassy green notes which leaves you wondering why it's called Santal at all. They stop shouting fairly quickly, and then sandalwood, vanilla, lavender, and spices slowly bloom over the course of the day. What you're left with is a milky, soapy, smooth-powdered sandalwood scent that soaks into the skin, a fresh crack of nose-tingling black pepper, all lightly warmed by frankincense & spices that whisper a touch of the far east - think lacquer boxes being traded from wooden ships at Hong Kong harbour. The sandalwood pulls rank, acting like cream swirled into coffee, harmoniously blending everything into a cosy and classy territory. Personally I've come to love this, and it's a great everyday spray for the price. In terms of projection, it's not going to announce you to the next village as you leave your house, but you WILL enjoy a quiet confidence in the dry down, and project a sophisticated aura for those lucky enough to be close to you. Intense version available for those who desire more power. 9/10."", ""This sauce is getting me all-day performance from three sprays, and it is a lovely concoction. Sandalwood is the star of the show, accentuated by clove/tobacco/vanilla to the dry down, and once it settles in it's a familiar and comforting post-shave barbershop, but classed up to eleven. My favorite part of it is the fresh opening, which I did not expect, these bright notes of cut-grass and a sharp citrus that just pop and rouse the senses. The composition is high art, and that doesn't happen by accident. This one was a labor of love. It's mature, yet full of vitality and vibrancy. Year-round versatility, too, as far as I'm concerned."", ""This is a Floris I like. It's a solid multi purpose fragrance. It's subtle with barbershop vibes.

Gently spicy, lightly sweet and perfect for winding down.

However, something in this is rather generic and I can't tell if I like this a lot or find it rather boring. Perhaps both? Try it for yourself, and see what I mean..."", 'I wore this perfume yesterday and it was good. Good like a clear sunny sky, and like a gentle breeze that you enjoy for a few minutes and then you simply neglect. Nice scent but nothing special that brings you to the front page.', ""Floris now offers an EDP version of Santal called Santal Intense and it's beautiful!"", 'Seriously bad performance on my skin ,to be honest there is very little scent at all even my wife can hardly smell it. Certainly not their best effort shame really because it sounds good on paper going by the notes.', 'I was intrigued by the blend of notes and ordered my boyfriend a sample. I love it on him as it‚Äôs an intimate, and soft scent that I love smelling on his skin and in his beard. It has a clean soapiness and gentle aromatic warmth that makes me picture him emerging from a hot, steamy shower and getting ready for the day ahead.  A classic fragrance that doesn‚Äôt smell like a generic men‚Äôs cologne, and works all year round. Spritzing into hands and patting onto facial hair after oil really makes the scent last longer, and I personally do think for the price it last reasonably well.', 'I\'ve spent the past several days wearing either Dunhill\'s Indian Sandalwood or D.R. Harris\' Sandalwood, both of which I really like. But this morning after shaving and bathing I used Floris\' Santal after shave, followed a few minutes later with 3 sprays of the EdT, and it has been one delightful morning. The sandalwood isn\'t front and centre with this one, but it is rather a thin veil over each and every one of the other notes. This gives it a quite rare ethereal quality that I\'ve found in few other fragrances, most notably in Penhaligon\'s Endymion cologne. Santal doesn\'t smell ""like"" Endymion, but the two have a similar almost angelic quality with which I am quite taken. And as Thomas Aquinas tells us, each angel is a species unto itself. Such a desirable scent. In typical Floris fashion, it is ever so discreet. Many confuse Floris\' discretion with a lack of performance. I don\'t think that\'s the case. The fragrance is there, but it becomes a part of me, and not something that either precedes or follows me. I appreciate that. And in any case, if I feel like I can\'t smell it there\'s still more in the bottle!', ""A very nice, subtle scent. It's quite refreshing and understated. I love the dry down on me (sandalwood and somewhat of a soapy scent), but the projection and longevity is abysmal.  For that reason, like using it after showers for a warm and relaxing scent. But when going out, I definitely need something a little shout-ier than this one."", ""Save for the minor short opening of citrus and cardamom, nothing else reminds me of Envy here. Its like a sweeter and thicker version of Endymion and not in a good way. The Penhaligon's transparent and airy qualities make it the overall better choice for me over this sticky Floris."", ""It's a soapy sandalwood dignified by a judicious use of spices. It's not very exciting, but it's still noble--it would be a good scent to wear to work, especially if you wanted to project a quiet gravitas. Although I would agree this is not something that I would describe as a powerhouse, this lasted for me a reasonable amount of time and projected reasonably well on my skin."", 'Yup. Performance is bad on my skin. Scent doesn‚Äôt project at all. Straight to skin scent', ""Signature scent material right here. I'm a huge fan of cedar and sandalwood and this one is fantastic. The pepper, nutmeg, and lavender blends seamlessly with cedar, vanilla, incense, sandalwood, and musk to make a concoction that gives of the creamy woody vibe of masculine, well mannered, gentleman. This reminds me of the drydown of Histories De Parfums 1828 which is one of my favorite fragrances of all time. However, floris is a little more airy and lighter which should give it a little more versatility (although 1828 is pretty versatile). Can be worn in just about any situation or weather. Full bottle on the way.  Another hit from the storied British House of Floris. üá¨üáß Scent 9/10 Performance TBD"", ""It‚Äôs a nice scent, somewhat reminiscent of barbershop fragrances of yesteryears; but it‚Äôs not anything mind-blowing & I mainly bought it off of the hype of it smelling similar to Envy, as I wanted to see what the hype was about. It‚Äôs nice & that‚Äôs all it is.  However, the performance on this is abysmal. This is probably THE worst perfume I‚Äôve owned in terms of projection and longevity. When you first spray it on, the projection is moderate with a personal scent bubble, but it‚Äôs completely a skin scent by the end of the first hour with it being completely gone by the time 2.5 hours have passed. Spraying it on heavily doesn‚Äôt make any difference to the performance & projection, either. Perhaps it‚Äôs a matter of skin chemistry, but my results have been similar to a friend‚Äôs experience. This is basically scented water.  If this was the only scent I had and was cursed to never get anything else, I'd still be sad and would've wished I rather had nothing at all."", ""When I was a kid, my mom had a Chinese fan made of sandalwood. I used to often remove it from its box and smell it. The scent was captivating to me. The dry down strongly reminds me of that fan's lovely smell. For that reason, I would say it has an authentic sandalwood smell. Perfectly unisex. Soft projection but quite long lasting from 3 sprays on my wrist. I think I have to get it."", 'Yes this resembles Envy, a much more subtle, less macho formula.. only this lacks the ginger, mossy feeling & incense smokey depth of the legendary juice & adds a creamy dapper vanilla. FS initially opens a bit fresh & for literally a few seconds I can smell the citrus. Quickly after the light warmth & intensity of the sandalwood, vanilla & spices kick in. Lavender & Vanilla are what keeps this profile balanced, interesting & delicious. Quite intoxicating. Heavy vanilla gives me day long headaches, but here in the dry down it‚Äôs just the right amount mixed with the perfect notes. Edit: 11/15/24 I got this sweet patchouli amber smell at the dry down.. Pleaseeee nooooo! I hate patchouli smells. Hope this never happens again üôèüèΩ', '2 minutes then it fades away‚Ä¶', ""In the beginning the lavender/lemon/green notes have this feeling way too soapy. *But* after a few minutes it opens up with vanilla and spices, nose tickling pepper, and dry sandalwood. It honestly reminds me of the cult classic bergamot/vanilla/cardamom/sandalwood bomb from the 90s, JOOP! Homme but much better. Imagine a turned down gentlemen's JOOP! without the screechy synthetic qualities or jasmine. I think it is lovely. A fresh, mildly sweet and sophisticated scent for any man, from a construction worker to a suit donning professional. *Edit* any resemblance to JOOP! died away rather quickly! Now it's a slightly sweet vanilla/pepper lavender/lemon freshie. Changing from a like to a love for how many times this scent has evolved, and the final result is just so damn nice."", 'This one failed the nose-wrinkle test: if my first impression of any fragrance is that involuntary reaction, I form an immediate dislike to it.  Eau de Santal begins with a blast of artificial spicy notes and seems just like any other Woody/Spicy fragrance you ever tested.  It settles down after a while into an unthreatening, low-key clovey musk ... but that nose-wrinkling effect is never far away for me.', ""One of the most beautiful scents ever, spicy, creamy sandalwood with nutmeg and clove, almost gourmand how delicious it is, the only downside is it's very weak in projection, but it doesn't matter, maybe even better ;) 10/10"", ""Opens up like Boucheron Jaipur, moves to smelling like L'eau D'issey without the bitterness then hits a Bleu de Channel dry down vibe with the base notes and Cardamom. If you like this type of fragrance, you'll like it, if not you won't. It's not bad, safe but not mass appealing. I don't see some young kid wearing this. The performance is underwhelming. The opening is strong, dries down to skin scent quickly. Basically this is going to be loved by certain people and for most of us, we'll be bored and/or disappointed by this. Glad I got to try it. It's very nice, casually classy. I really love the soft warm dry down with the slight smokiness."", 'Have had Santal in my collection for a while and returned to it now that my nose has matured a little. I love the history of Floris and think Santal lives up to this in being a very classic scent. I get the fresh, green top notes when it is first sprayed, and eventually goes warmer.  For me, I‚Äôd wear Santal for everyday use and to enjoy whilst running an errand. Safe to wear in the office but unfortunately, longevity is quite weak on me.', 'Lovely soft, gentlemanly, traditional Sandalwood. Yes, you will most likely have come across similar before and often at a cheaper price, but this is done incredibly well and I like it more every time I wear it. Although Floris isn‚Äôt the cheapest house, it can often be found at discounters well below RRP making this an ideal office scent for the transitional seasons (Spring & Autumn). Its fresh, clean, sophisticated and will make anyone smell very professional. This and Burberry touch will be my go to Spring work scents this year until the warmer weather hits in the UK (usually around late April/May).', 'Generic male perfume üò© I had a hard time detecting any sandalwood. This was such a disappointment, as it‚Äôs one of those scents that you can find a million places for less money. It felt kind of sharp and cloying, definitely a scrubber for me üßΩ First time trying a scent from Floris I didn‚Äôt like ü•≤', 'Really nice, smooth, very well blended, vaguely interesting but definitely not exciting.', 'About a month ago, I was looking for a warm spicy-vanilla fragrance for late fall/winter. I bought decants of Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille, Spicebomb Extreme and Herod. While I can see why people like those fragrances, to me TV was way too sweet and SE‚Äôs opening was way too harsh. Herod I liked quite a bit. The thing is I only would want to wear it when in the mood for sweet tobacco, which is rare. My search for a new winter frag continued. I saw a review for Floris Santal from Wafts from the Loft, and I ordered a bottle. After first spraying it, I wasn‚Äôt so sure I‚Äôd like it as the spices in the opening are quite bold (though not harsh like SE). After a few minutes I liked it more. After 15-20 minutes the spices settled down and I began to appreciate this gem. I soon decided Floris Santal was what I‚Äôd been looking for. The citruses nicely compliment the cardamom, nutmeg pepper and clove in the opening before the smooth lavender and vanilla become apparent. The spices are perfectly blended and balanced and not overly bold at all. Just perfect. The spices and lavender continue as the citrus fades, then vanilla and woods become more apparent in the drydown. As the drydown continues, it becomes much like what TV would be like if 90% of its √ºber-sweetness were removed and woods were added. Tasty spices and vanilla, and the sandalwood, are what remain after a few hours. I just love this. I love the way it evolves. It‚Äôs become my signature fall/winter scent. It‚Äôs perfectly elegant. I‚Äôll wear it until early spring before putting it away until the fall.', 'I picked this up as part of the 5-sample ""Jermyn Street Collection"" from Floris. I sprayed this on and something about it screamed ""late 90s"". I guess I was off by a few years, since this is from 2002. I get warm but also fresh and green. Spicy but restrained, only a touch of sweetness. Woody, maybe a touch floral, mildly musky. This one has a lot going on. I feel like I get something different every time I sniff. Something about this reminds me of Penaligon\'s Opus 1870, but I find this far more pleasant. It also reminds me a touch of Creed Viking, probably the clove. This has a masculine feel, rather like a barbershop scent with the spice and a very slight powderiness. But it also somehow feels unisex. I could completely see a woman wearing this. Very wearable. This is my favorite of the samples I got. I will doubtless keep wearing this until the sample is empty and consider whether I want more then.', ""Fall winter scent: 6,5 The smell is mature, classic and masculine.

Good for a professional setting. Not quite strong enough for the depths of winter.', ""Opens with dry sandalwood...reminds me a tiny bit of Santal 33 or GFT Sandalwood. Then the spices come on and it's a nice, natural, proper English, sandalwood. A hint of sweetness from the spices, but not sweet. Some of the citrus opening lingers in the drydown. Natural and well mannered. Very pleasant. Could be an alternative to GFT Sandalwood. A very well mannered, subdued Spicebomb? Definitely a like, maybe a love?

I've tried a few Floris(es), the openings are bright and jaunty but they don't last terribly long. If Floris could amp this up, plenty Envy addicts would pile in. As it is Dua's Covet is good, close to Envy and lasts. Trying to appraise Floris Santal objectively is hard but surely anyone with a half decent nose is going to enjoy this one. Given lightness it's probably best suited to spring or summer, just be prepared to respray. 3.5/5"", 'The opening is very similar to Gucci Envy but it becomes a bit soapier in the mid and veers off into its own direction in the dry down. A nice fragrance when judged on its own merits, but it is not a replacement for Gucci Envy which is much richer, deeper and louder than Santal - and does not have the same soapiness. I definitely get Creed Original Santal vibes from this one.', 'Well I have finally had the chance to wear this for a while now and during some warmer Spring weather where I have found the fragrance opens up a lot more and performs much better with both projection and longevity.  I managed to get a discounted bottle online and it is worth every penny, there is nothing else in the market you can buy that smells like this. I managed to test the discontinued Gucci Envy a mate had in his collection, indeed it has strong similarities but also notable differences and by no means is Santal a clone. Needless to say, Envy was a wonderful frag with cult status I remember well from my younger years and I am happy to have something that reminds me of it. This formulation of Santal works well with my skin and I am happy to say I have finally found my signature fragrance for Spring and Autumn / Fall happy days. Peace and Slava Ukrainia!', ""@ Btmfdr well I guess and hope you learn't the lesson that you need to test the fragrance batch on your skin before pulling the trigger. Batches always change with fragrances that have a good amount of natural ingredients.  Simply the batch you tried for 2021 did not work with your skin, it does not mean it won't with other peoples skin and that goes for any fragrance with a good amount of naturals."", 'I purchased this a few years ago due to its similarity to Gucci envy, and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Lovely fragrance. However I purchased a 2021 batch at Christmas and i have to say the performance is inexcusable. It disappears within minutes, even after 5 or 6 sprays. For a niche brand like this it‚Äôs shocking. I returned it. A great fragrance ruined entirely due to its lack of staying power. I hope they fix this', ""I have tested this for a week now and I can comfortably say I enjoy the scent journey and the airy, smooth, soft nature of this scent. Projection is about 1 hour and then the scent sits fairly close to the skin however, I would expect in warmer Spring / Autumn weather for it to have better sillage and projection as I am testing this is winter. The longevity on my olive skin was about 6 hours, naturally on clothes it will be a couple of hours longer, but all in all pretty good for an EDT, I would not have an issue respraying with a travel sprayer as I am not expecting longevity like most EDP fragrances. The scent is very clean, fresh and not too rich of any particular accord as the blending is just perfect, as expected from a niche house like Floris that uses high quality ingredients. The scent overall is just lovely and very pleasant, sophisticated yet calming, it made me feel good and relaxed and in no way did it smell dated. I have been looking for a nice versatile fragrance with the aforementioned characteristics to be a new signature scent, as opposed to the mainstream ISO E, ambroxian tonka bombs out there and I think I may have found it, but I will need to give this a few more wears in another season. So far I am both impressed with Santal and surprised considering how much flak it has received from some reviews on here, to me this is a highly underated fragrance and I feel its not only to do with the fragrance itself but also with the brand association some people may have with Floris who struggle to identify themselves with such an old fashioned house thats not hip and trendy let alone overly popular. I would think this fragrance would be suited for a professional man aged 26 and up looking for a subtle versatile signature scent that can be for daily use, formal lunches, interviews, the office or even just smart casual events. Anyway don't just take my word for it like all fragrances you must test this and see how it performs with your skin. Peace :)"", 'Beautiful scent. Perfect blend of fresh, sweet, and spice. Very classy signature scent. No one can dislike it and is unique that people know it‚Äôs something they‚Äôve never smelled before', 'I always have had a soft spot for a well done sandalwood scent, and this is really refined, fresh and welcoming.', 'Just read the review by @JmThms (Jim Thomas?) I recognise everything he‚Äôs said in far greater detail than the review that I wrote. If you want a review that reflects this scent accurately, then this is the one. I‚Äôm English and have every reason to want this scent to be great, but apart from smelling nice, it doesn‚Äôt have a lot going for it, especially for the price!', ""This is one that needed a 2nd & 3rd wearing to grow on me. Floris is one of my favorite houses but I much prefer their newer releases, the older ones sometimes are too powdery for me. So, I wanted to give Santal a try & upon first wearing wasn't impressed (I even decided to sell it). This is a case where my laziness paid off. I didn't get to selling it right away & eventually tried it again & began to appreciate it. It's probably not a fragrance that many people under 35 would like, not typically at least. It is complex & it takes a bit of time to get to know it. It's changes are subtle but they are there. Sometimes I get, albeit for only moment, that great whiff of fresh cut grass soon after application, sometimes I don't. I do get a hefty dose of cedar & santal consistently. Sandalwood frags aren't my usual style but when the mood strikes this one hits the spot. I have no complaints about the longevity but I'm also not sticking my nose into my wrist every minute or two either. A few sprays behind each ear is lasting 5 to 6 hours & that's about as long as I want it to."", ""I've just sprayed it on 10 minutes ago for the first time. It is a nice scent profile, as I expected given the listed notes. But I can barely smell it when I put my nose to it just 10 minutes later. I expect that won't improve (update several hours later: nope didn't improve. Over 10 sprays and can barely detect anything). Whenever you see both longevity and projection rated as 'moderate' here in Fragrantica for a non aquatic ozonic freshie, you know there's a problem. It's obvious that the 4.34 overall rating here is due to the nice scent profile. With the performance likely being extremely and indefensibly poor, that rating should be closer to 4.00. A fragrance with these notes SHOULD have good longevity. The perfumer failed. Elite is my favorite Floris and has not a too dissimilar note profile, and it has good longevity (despite its Fragrantica ratings of 'moderate'). The scent IS nice. This is NOT feminine, as a few reviews below seem to suggest. Unisex maybe, but more masculine in my opinion. Someone mentioned D&G The One, and it is in the same general vibe neighborhood, less the tobacco, ginger and plus the lavender. Both sit very close to the skin. Maybe similar also to my recent formulation of YSL Jazz, which has been watered down and struggles for a skin scent after 10 minutes. Gucci Envy for Men is the best comparison scent profile wise, except Santal veers greener largely due I guess to the grass note, but man o man if only this Santal had the performance. I've since become a huge fan of the discontinued Gucci Envy for Men, acquiring bottles of it. And so my appreciation of Floris Santal has increased. But the performance is inexcusable. Ive never smelled Maison Martin Margiela Replica Whispers in the Library, but this scent seems it would fit that profile to a tee. It does have a dusty old parchment smell, as if it were replicating old library book page smell. And the scent sure is a whisper. Actually, I know that I've smelled old book pages with a stronger smell than this. If you buy this nice scent, keep in mind that you will need to spray the heck out of it per wearing. And even then it will struggle. Several hours later I can say the performance of Santal is extremely poor."", 'Firstly, don‚Äôt fall for buying the ‚Äúaftershave‚Äù that‚Äôs being pushed on the search engines etc on Amaz0n for the same price as the edt! Anyway. The package arrived this morning. First impression - I get something similar to Bentley Men Intense. There‚Äôs also some patchouli although none mentioned in the notes above. Now I see where the Coromandel reference in the comments came from. Well. I‚Äôll wear it and see what happens! Disappointing. Not because of the reasons others have given, but because it‚Äôs like a faded, 1 dimensional version of a fragrance that I already have 2 full bottles of. Have I got a bad bottle? This is weak as one could imagine. I‚Äôm going to try one more Floris. Probably no 89 (unless someone can recommend a better one) and if that is garbage, I won‚Äôt bother with any more. The cheapie bottle of Yardley Elite that I purchased with this has put Santal to shame and at 1125pm is still kicking out after 13 hours!

I haven‚Äôt tried Gucci Envy but I do have a decant of Carven Homme and I would personally choose the Carven over the Floris as I think it is a bit more interesting and has it‚Äôs own spicier warmer personality. So a decent scent but not one I would buy a full bottle of myself.', ""This is the subtle sort of fragrance that fades into the background. I think this is why it's rated as low longevity if you're waring it you do tend to forget about it. For me at least it's actually still there 16hr after I put it on.  The combination of low silliage and such long life is new to me though I know they're independent. The scent it self is a very classic spicy wood. For me I don't get much of the citrus top notes though the pepper and spice heart comes up quickly and hints of lavender, sandalwood, and vanilla play hide and seek all day. Great office scent. People probably won't remark on your cologne, but they will think you smell good..."", ""If there is one fragrance whose performance issues I could forgive, it is Floris Santal. This one changed my perception on the strength of fragrances, where I began to appreciate beauty in subtlety. The note pyramid gives the impression of a rather bold, peppery, and heavily woodsy masculine aroma. However, it is as mentioned, quite understated, and never really promised to be much of a powerhouse. As obvious as the sandalwood is, it never really dominates the composition, and gives way to other notes like cardamom, nutmeg, pepper, and vanilla. So yes, it can in fact be called a creamy sandalwood fragrance, though the sandalwood is gracious enough to take a back seat in order to yield an aromatic and vanillic scent. Clearly, what we have here is a rather simplistic scent, but it somehow manages to trigger an inexplicable high in me, almost like a narcotic effect.

Wow!', ""A very pleasant spicy aromatic scent. Although it shares some similarities with Gucci's Envy for men, Floris Santal does however venture into a different direction.

It reminds me very much of Penhaligon's Endymion but has less of a creamy coffee like smell. The spiciness is a little fruity. To my mind there is almost an orange and spice smell to it. This is not a scent that I see as being a long lasting developing scent. However it is still a joy to wear this perfume."", ""On me, this is soft and discreet.

Not bad, not for me. 5/10"", ""I got a sample, I'v been wanting to explore Floris frags. It opens harsh, it has a ruberry synthetic harshness just the first few minutes, and then becomes quite good. When the opening settles I get one of the best creamy smooth sandalwoods, slightly reminding me of the best sandalwood fragrance in the world, Creed Boise du Portugal. So you get that nice wood, lavender, and some sweet vanela, cloves, moss.  I dont think I will be purchasing a bottle, as I have Boise Portugal. This fragrance reminded me, of when I was exploring the old classics. This Floris Santal reminds me most of vintage Givenchy Xeryus. It even feels like there is a good dose of oakmoss or tree moss in this one. You can still get this for under $60. / 100 ml tester, so thats a very good value, as this is not a great fragrance, but better quality than most designer frags. I would'nt buy it because of the ruberry opening. If you can look past that it may be worth a try. If you like the sandalwood in this, you would love Creed Boise du Portugal. This is also a bit like Habit Rouge, but darker, warmer. Update: I increased my rating, and am liking this more. It does have a classic feel, inbetween fougere and chypre. It is warm and cozy, it will be great in cold weather, yet it has enough freshness to where I'm enjoying it in Summer, though indoors with air conditioning. It has a nice vanela and some sweetness added for balance, and keeping it a classy, comfort scent. It also reminds me mostly of the 50+ I have in my collection, Tom Ford for Men Extreme. I think I will ad this to my permanent colection, Tom Ford for Men Extreem is nicer when I want to wear this type of fragrance, but Floris Santal is half the price, and the quality is close.  Signature type scent for Fall and Winter... Rating 8.5/10 God bless. John 3:16"", 'Stunning! This is beautiful from the first spray. There is a hint of lemon at the start, but you are greeted with a spicy sandalwood aroma as soon at it hits your skin. The spiciness (in particular the cloves)fades quickly but never vanishes. The combination of the lavender and cardamom give this an almost soapy quality, while the faint spices keep it from being dull. This has tremendous longevity (about 7hrs; winter 15oC), great projection (arms length after several hours) and mesmerising delicate sillage. It is very inviting, and draws admiring compliments in just about any setting. I have noticed that if I spray this on my shirt, the spiciness remains much longer, so if you want more of this character, one spray on a cuff or collar will do wonders. On your clothes (cotton) it will last 15hours Toward the end of the day the sandalwood and lavender remains dominant and with the vanilla becoming more prominent. Eventually, the cloves, nutmeg and pepper nuances disappear.  I recently wore it to the gym (after 8hrs work) and inspite of my perspiration it smelled very alluring - by that stage it was a soapy sandalwood scent.', ""Got a sample from lucky scent..oh this is the BEST lavender and sandalwood scent I have EVER hot my nose on. Period.  I want to know if it has ever been reformulated?  I ask because the bottle has changed . I think this could really get a lot of love if more people knew about it. Amazing scent ! Edit update** I still love this stuff! In terms of scent, one of the best in it's category of scent, but the longevity is pretty poor. If you enjoy this stuff I highly recommend you try eight and bob - Egypt. It's amazing and the longevity is about the same maybe a little bit longer, but adds a little more sexiness to it!"", ""Creamy, Woody, Spicy... I love this one. After only trying it a short while I have begun to really appreciate it. It's a wonderful mix here, a blend of creamy sandalwood and peppery woods and amber. A mix of cardamom, cloves and vanilla to compliment the lovely wood composition. Incredibly nice smelling too! I received a compliment whilst wearing it! I think this is one which would be fantastic on a well dressed man. It is a refined, elegant mix and works well in both warm and cool weather. I highly recommend it, and in my opinion could also be a signature scent. I can see the similarities with Gucci Envy for Men (which I used to own), but this one is both smoother and creamier. It is more subtle and that is one aspect I like about it, as if the exotic nature of the woods and spices have been tamed and refined. A very very good fragrance. I will enjoy this one a lot."", ""Floris Santal Review: This fragrance starts of with a fairly subdued spicy opening. The spiciness comes from the cardamom mixed with a hint of pepper. Just like with everything else in this scent, the pepper never feels brash or abrasive to your senses. Sitting behind this spicy concoction is just a little bit of citrus.  The opening then leads into a soft lavender mid, with a creamy sandalwood base. It amazingly accomplishes all of this with a fresh airiness to it all. It's a beautiful fragrance in it's simplicity and is one of my absolute favorites. This is one of the fragrances that gets compared to the classic Gucci Envy on occasion. From what I have tried, this is the smell that reminds me of Envy the most. It just so happens, that for my personal tastes, I actually prefer this one. It has a lighter and brighter smell to it than Gucci. This is a perfect fragrance to add to your Fall and Spring Rotations. Also, if you find the Extreme version I would definitely pick it up. It's a bit stronger than the original and would be quite a find.

Santal has a little bit of everything. Spice - clove, ginger and cardamom. Fruity/citrus notes - lemon, lime and lychee. Warmth - this scent excudes a cozy and sexy heat from sandalwood and lavender, the kind of warmth that makes a woman think ""...no matter what happens tonight I just want to be close to you..."" - this makes Santal a damn sexy fragrance with a little bit of a classical/barbershop vibe.  A first class fragrance fit for a true gent. I like the reviewer that says she smelled this on Placido Domingo - I can totally imagine him wearing this...', 'THIS DESERVES FAR MORE HYPE THAN IT GETS!!! beautiful. smells classy and like a gentleman without any ""dated"" notes', 'A review, feedback and thank-you for those who suggested this stunning sandalwood and subtle spice scent. I rate this handsome Brit in the same elite league as other masterpieces on my shelf such as Endymion, Lumiere Noire, Gris Clair etc. Charismatic and bright in his brief sparkling citrus and bergamot greeting. Santal is a charming guest with a soft sandal and tastefully sweet vanilla in his company your nose will linger a long time. Never cloying keeping the right amount of clove and enviable natural spice of interest in his gentlemanly sillage. Often compared to another nineties classic this creamy drydown to my nose resembles a more refined cousin to the classic Italian D&G PH and that is a true perfume compliment to both! I admire scents such as this that are both discreet in their presence but still very confident in the image they project. This is a genuine must have in any sophisticated gents wardrobe. Kind Regards, Plat ~ Score - Yes, 10/10 for my taste.', 'As the weather cools, I am wearing this more (I bought bottles of Floris Honey Oud and Floris Santal a few months ago)and I love this scent. It is a sexy, spicy fragrance that is great in cooler weather. Love the vanilla, lavender, spicy notes.', ""An absolutely superb scent that exudes warmth and masculinity. If you're looking for a classic, but not dated, men's scent this is it. It's better suited to winter like most warm, sandalwood scents, but I find it pleasant year round. It starts off very nicely with sandalwood and a touch of clove. As it develops, the cedar appears, along with lite touches of cardamom and vanilla; the dry-down is a creamy combination of vanilla and sandalwood, but remains warm and elegant without ever getting sweet or powdery. I don't get any lemon or grass from this as the notes suggest, just sandalwood all the way thru. It can easily be worn from day to nite, fitting in everywhere. It has, like most of Floris' scents, great sillage and longevity and is for mine, THE way a gentleman should smell."", ""Wow! I got this fragrance instantly and that's saying something because it goes on a distinctive journey. Opens with lavender and lemon with a soapy spice of cardamom which remains but settles back after a minute or so. Then waves of boozy coconut, nutmeg and black pepper. Then the kick of the spicy woods in the base with some olibanum in there...it's awesome! 'Sandalwood done right.'... is my opinion on this, it's just a masterful composition which clicks with me. I have to say it's instantly similar to Gucci Envy, a scent I sorely miss but Floris Santal might just be even better. It's not strong and performance is pretty average but I can live with that. It seems a little classier and more refined to my nose but I'm going off memory as I haven't smelled Envy in years now. I certainly wouldn't pay Ebay prices for a bottle these days, just get this. I'm getting this, no doubt about it."", 'A smooth, intimate sandalwood fragrance with a peper twist... I applied 6 heavy sprays o - 3 hours - 6 inch light projection with wider sillage trails. This takes 30 seconds or so to materialise but soon the sandalwood comes to the fore with a twist - I had to smell close to the skin but got a blast of very clear and well done black pepper. The sandalwood is smooth and the purist will like it 3 hours - 5 hours - 3 inch projection with wider sillage trails. This frag gets smoother as time goes on 5 hours - 6.5 hours- Close to skin.  This frag is well made.  Lovers of Creed Santal may like this if they want something a little more intimate.  Lovers of sandalwood may like this as it offers a slightly different slant with the pepper Very Unisex Not bad', ""The first time I smelled this heavenly scent, i was in the elevator with Placido Domingo who was on his way to a performance. He was sumptuously dressed in a tuxedo with diamond buttons. But, what I remember most about meeting him is how good he smelled. I couldn't resist asking him what scent he was wearing. I could not imagine what divine scent it was - what would one of the best opera singers of our time, one of the most elegantly dressed men I've ever seen wear?? It was Floris Santal. The rich sandalwood and warmth exudes elegance and fit him to a T."", 'Used to love santal extreme, but for some reason they stopped producing it But still nice fragrance', ""A lot of people like this one among sandalwood scents, but to me it's really an odd mix. Of all the sweet, vanillic sandalwoods, I recall thinking that this stuff takes the cake, going beyond the sweet concoctions of Trumpers Sandalwood and Truefitt Spanish Leather, though I'm not getting that as much this time. The opening is still reassuringly sharp, but with a very christmas-wreath sharpness and some leather underneath. There's a period in the mid notes where I find a surprisingly smooth and suave nutmeg, without its usual bite, and this fits nicely over the coniferous wreath notes. This phase is like a more refined and balanced Rocabar, with less vanilla. I thought I remembered cherry cough syrup emerging from the forest notes last time, but now I'm only getting smooth and slightly medicinal wood. Finally it hits me, though: some kind of unearthly mango or banana, the same that appears in spades in Lucky Number 6, making a sort of fruity oriental over the wood. It's much more restrained here, though, and doesn't upset the overall balance. If I didn't recognize this surprising connection, and a sudden similarity to Gucci Envy in the final base notes, I'd have just said Floris Santal is an unnaturally sweet woody oriental. Since I found those links, though, and especially the fruit component, I've warmed up to it as if I suddenly got where the scent is coming from."", 'I finally got my hands on a beautiful bottle of Floris Santal.. My interest in Floris Santal started when I was seeking a replacement for my beloved Gucci Envy.. Well my bottle came today and it is gorgeous.. Beautiful clear glass bottle with a light greenish colored juice.. Without hesitation I got ready to go out and I sprayed it on.. I immediately noticed not only is it similar to Envy but it smells amazing! From the initial blast, you can tell that this fragrance is very good quality and it has a lot going on.. It is far from just sandalwood like the name would suggest.. It is a gorgeous green cocktail of spices, woods, olibanum, and a hint of citrus.. Both Santal and Envy contain a lot of different notes, some are the same and some differ.. But overall they are very close to each other.. Envy is stronger, richer, and darker.. Envy contains alot of incense which gives it a darker feel.. Santal is like a lighter, brighter version of Envy.. The two are very very similar! Santal smells like an exotic love potion for men.. It smells sexy, but classy and sophisticated.. It has decent projection and longevity.. I feel great wearing this and I am happy I have found a great replacement for Envy!', ""I agree that Floris Santal shares some similarities with Gucci Envy for Men, however it appears to have its own distinctive personality rather than being just a copy. Santal is a smooth, spicy sandalwood fragrance. Definitely unisex, although marketed to men. Like Gucci Envy for Men, Santal is a tad sweet, with a delectable array of notes including, clove, cardamom, nutmeg, vanilla and lavender. On my female skin, the nutmeg, sandalwood, vanilla and cardamom are the most dominant accords. The drydown is surprisingly creamy, a delicate, sandalwood infused finish that wears beautifully on the skin. The sillage may not be as strong as Gucci Envy for Men, but I'm rather enjoying this lighter alternative. Seeing that Floris has named this fragrance Santal, you may be forgiven for expecting to smell a simplistic sandalwood based scent. The complexity and varying layers may come as a bit of a shock. Floris Santal is fast becoming one of my favourites from this niche brand. Oddly enough I have begun exploring Floris by testing their masculine scents first. I can happily say that I have been more than impressed. On a finishing note, the longevity is superb and the projection soft yet pleasing."", 'Floris - Santal A beautiful spicy opening with touches of grass and lemon.

The only thing I wish is that the volume of the fragrance was slightly turned up as it does feel too quiet for its own good. Nice fragrance though.', 'Gucci Envy For Men anyone? A nice fresh/spicy oriental composition that\'s way too similar to the previously mentioned fragrance (except for the ginger).

I am not kidding, this is the BEST fragrance I have ever smelled. It is sweet, sophisticated, classy, gentleman-like, and just all-around pleasing to my nose. This is a gentleman‚Äôs fragrance. It is a man in all scenarios. You can wear this to the office as well as in a tuxedo. Even while sitting by the pool. There is no way this would ever offend anyone. The downside to this is it only lasts about 4-6 hours on me and it stays pretty close to my skin. For the scent profile of this is, it is an 11/10, absolutely amazing. I just wish it would stick around for the whole day.  Either way, I think this is a full bottle worthy purchase. Get your nose on this, it's absolutely divine.

But this morning after shaving and bathing I used Floris\' Santal after shave, followed a few minutes later with 3 sprays of the EdT, and it has been one delightful morning. The sandalwood isn\'t front and centre with this one, but it is rather a thin veil over each and every one of the other notes. This gives it a quite rare ethereal quality that I\'ve found in few other fragrances, most notably in Penhaligon\'s Endymion cologne. Santal doesn\'t smell ""like"" Endymion, but the two have a similar almost angelic quality with which I am quite taken. And as Thomas Aquinas tells us, each angel is a species unto itself. Such a desirable scent. In typical Floris fashion, it is ever so discreet. Many confuse Floris\' discretion with a lack of performance. I don\'t think that\'s the case. The fragrance is there, but it becomes a part of me, and not something that either precedes or follows me. I appreciate that. And in any case, if I feel like I can\'t smell it there\'s still more in the bottle!', 'I purchased this a few years ago due to its similarity to Gucci envy, and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Lovely fragrance. However I purchased a 2021 batch at Christmas and i have to say the performance is inexcusable. It disappears within minutes, even after 5 or 6 sprays. For a niche brand like this it‚Äôs shocking. I returned it. A great fragrance ruined entirely due to its lack of staying power. I hope they fix this', 'Eau de Santal is a bright, spicy sandalwood fragrance, with some sweet, powdery, and aromatic touches. Good for a professional setting. Not quite strong enough for the depths of winter.', 'On my skin, it lasts for a few minutes and then I cannot smell it. What I smell is great, and I love the cardamom. Unfortunately, even with 6-8 sprays, it doesn‚Äôt last. It will be a bed time scent.', 'This one failed the nose-wrinkle test: if my first impression of any fragrance is that involuntary reaction, I form an immediate dislike to it.  Eau de Santal begins with a blast of artificial spicy notes and seems just like any other Woody/Spicy fragrance you ever tested.  It settles down after a while into an unthreatening, low-key clovey musk ... but that nose-wrinkling effect is never far away for me.', ""Save for the minor short opening of citrus and cardamom, nothing else reminds me of Envy here. Its like a sweeter and thicker version of Endymion and not in a good way. The Penhaligon's transparent and airy qualities make it the overall better choice for me over this sticky Floris.""]"

This one walks the same synthetic love it/hate it line as Individuel. I get Plum, Cardamom, Vanilla, Rum, and Musk. None of these notes smells close to natural. It's definitely not a summer fragrance, and since I live where we rarely get any days cold enough to wear this, it will likely end up being my next bathroom/bedroom spray. 11/24 Update: I've realized that Lacoste shouldn't get a pass because they came out with something this unpleasant, especially since they've done so many other fragrances so well. I can still remember how much I loved Lacoste Red (Style in Play) that came out a few years later, and L.12.12 Blanc. I just sprayed Pour Homme today and it's just not even close to that level.

Yeah lots of plum, very bright, synthetic, too sweet in the heat. I'd really like to try this in the winter, and I will. But as for summer, three sprays is too much.

I think Lacoste is a house for guys in their teens/twenties. Edit: Three days later and I'm thinking about this fragrance. It's memorable for sure, I'm definitely gonna try this again. I did like the smell."", ""After having this bottle for over 10 years and starting a collection of fragrances in the last 3 years I can‚Äôt believe how much I still like this scent. Being a cheapy I would have expected this to become less of a compelling scent after trying so many other fragrances but this one just has such a unique profile and works for so many occasions it‚Äôs hard to ignore. It is also my wife‚Äôs favorite when I wear it. Even though it has fruit I still wouldn‚Äôt call it fruity but has the right mix to be a great everyday office/work scent. Has some sweetness to it but is balanced enough it‚Äôs not overly sweet. The plum is dominant note in opening but it‚Äôs kept tame by the sour of the grapefruit and green apple. Then juniper and cardamom play off each other to create a nice landing of musky woods and a touch of rum and vanilla in the dry down. I don't get much cinnamon. My bottle is older than dirt so my review is not based off of current formula. The notes listed make it sound heavy but it‚Äôs far from it. I guess for Lacoste it is heavier than other offerings. Only fragrances I have tried that are in same vein are Gucci Made to Measure & Mont Blanc Individual if it lost its raspberry note. Longevity and silage is average at best but being a work scent I don‚Äôt mind. Body heat tends to bring it back alittle. It‚Äôs not strong enough for winter but all other months of years it‚Äôs a great daytime fragrance that is hard to dislike for anyone. Not profound but great rounded fragrance. 8/10"", ""Awesome everyday scent. This is good signature attempt. But the longevity is not good at all. Two hours with four sprays. But it's so good, fruity and musky. From my time wearing it (right now it's week or so) the dry down is more unisex but still masculine enough to wear this while being son of greek god and norse warrior."", ""Great everyday cologne for any occasion. I love this stuff. It is fresh, but at the same time balanced. I cannot think of an occasion or season. that this would be inappropriate to wear. I'd even go so far as to say that this is my new signature scent!"", ""4 Dec 2022 - First Impression I blind buy this and it have positive review on most of youtuber review and I would  like to have something from House of Lacoste as my first fragrance I ordered online many years back (It was LACOSTE Booster and LACOSTE Essential). Wow, this is nice. Open with plum note Which is dominant, very sweet and tasty. Apple and citruses barely presents in the top note. Lead to Warm spicy most dominant by Cardamom very The One by D&G. Cinnamon aspect presented lightly under Cardamom. Peppery is very low, juniper is not their.This linger quite long. Around 3 hours Base is vanilla with rum which is amplified overall tone of this fragrance to be more loud, and mild boozy (not overwhelming) but creamy and smooth as well, I think Rum in base kinda enhance the plum to be dominant in top when rum is run out it just powder and musk (the vanilla in this feels higher quality side). Overall life is around 5-6 hours Most project 2-3 hours which is not bad considering this is EDT. I feel like this is fragrance that better in Air than up-close. Very difference from house of Lacoste which normally make Green/Freshie, This is very Warm and Strong would, not really Grey fragrance but more like Brown. (Aramani Code Profumo, D&G The One, Azzaro Wanted by Night) If someone say this is house of Burberry, I would believe  (Very similar tone layering to Burberry Brit for Him) Quite similar to The One by D&G (but going in Fruity direction)  a bit fresher / lighter and no tobacco. Consider this is 30 bucks, it is good for cheapie fragrance. Kinda synthetic but it ok. Scent profile fits mostly for night as it leans sweet, cozy and boozy. Can be formal if you are not center of event. Can be fun night out fragrance for corporate event but spicy aspect might be too much. It‚Äôs kinda have formal tone to it but it doesn‚Äôt feel very premium (but consider this is cheapie, it is smell better than the price) If don‚Äôt mild spicy profile this could fit your bill. As scent - 7/10 As cheapie - 8/10 ===== 1st Wear I give this a nice full wear and yes, it is a scent that better in the air than direct smell. It seems to be classier side but still have fun. Young. Carefree. undertone. it's also have that mild sporty undertone to it age group would be 25-30 yo. and it can be wear both day and night but I would reserve this for evening - night. As it still have that mild boozy feel to it. The projection is good around 2 hours before it comes closer to skin. The full life of this fragrance is around 6 hours then it disappears without a trace of skin scent (like it all gone) and it is only downfall. Final score Solid 7/10 Personal rating 6/10 Suggestion : I think this make good cheapie to throw in the car and use as back up fragrance as refreshment before night out. Would I repurchase - No - I found out I doesn't like boozy fragrance. It's smell too fun for me."", ""I've had this one for over a year now. I don't reach for it that often, but it really is a nice fragrance. I like the way it has so many notes that could possibly be hard to describe without seeing a note list. I would have never said plum for example, but after seeing that note listed I can imagine that may be one note, but not sure if it's the power of suggestion.  I like the unique balance to this. Its sweetness is just right, not syrupy or heavy-fruity, or heavy at all. It's fresh, but not a freshie. It has a powdery aspect, but I wouldn't categorize it as a powder fragrance. I get some woods, but wouldn't put in in a wood category. It's just different. One of the Lacoste fragrances that I really enjoy, a house that deserves a little more credit than it sometimes gets.  I also think it has pretty good performance and projection, but not great. Better than some others have unfortunately experienced. I would also say it's better for cool weather, but can see it good for any season as a work/indoor fragrance."", ""I don't understand why this perfume is not more popular, very good smell. It has similarities with Hugo Boss Bottled EDT, but this one has a plum note that gives it a different touch. Very wearable and comfortable, in my opinion, for all seasons, except for summer, I wouldn't wear it when it's hot."", 'I absolutely love the plum note that dominates the opening and mid of this fragrance.

Solid performance as well and for a cheapie.  Aces.', ""The Firas Mohammad review in this thread is well said, comprehensive & accurate. Compliments dial in on the warmth & vanilla, it smells like a 3x - 4x above what it cost and distinguishes you from the blue frag & aventus clone crowd. This has replaced Mont Blanc Starwalker in my rotation as it's less common, and a notch better in my opinion."", ""Really really dislike this scent. Might even be close to a hate for me if it weren't for the fact that after about 30min it smells more manageable. The plum note in this fragrance is straight up nasty but thankfully it fades away somewhat after that 30min mark or so. If they took that disgusting plum note out altogether, this would be a very lovely scent profile. But all I get within the first half hour is plum, plum, and more nasty plum. Once it is gone however, you are left with a somewhat decent soft spicy feel which isn't too bad. I'm selling my 95% full bottle on this one because I have tried on 3 different occasions to give it a chance and I just don't like it. I give it a 5/10."", ""I love this scent! I think it's the pink pepper and rum that really get me. I'm surprised that people suggest that this is not a summer fragrance - to me it's nicely fresh and better suited to the warmer months. Awful performance for me though. Barely get half an hour and I can no longer smell it on clothes or skin."", 'This fragrance flys under the radar, and is probably the best release from this house. It‚Äôs one of the best cheapies you could find!', ""After a lot of use of the perfume, I found that plum and green apple are the most prominent notes when starting to spray the perfume.After the opening phase ends, cinnamon and cardamom enter, but the cinnamon here is not rough, noisy or suffocating, but rather warm and agreeable, and gives a slight spicy touch to the fragrance. In the end, the vanilla is characterized by its creamy character with a note I could not recognize, and touches of sandalwood. The fragrance is fruity with a little sweetness, a bit of warmth due to cinnamon and cardamom, and also creamy as a result of vanilla and sandal, it smells nice, classy, elegant, comfortable, semi-fresh and uncomplicated, completely safe, easy to wear, does not bother anyone, a fragrance that smells good and gets the job done . It is not one of the fragrances of excitement and temptation, nor of power, nor control and influence, nor perfume of recovery and gyms, but it is a general perfume, for multiple use, day and night, very ideal for the office, or college and even high school, and for all ages. Lacoste pour homme perfume can be bought without trying, as well as wearing it without thinking, wherever you want to go, and in all seasons of the year, especially spring and autumn, and it will not let you down. The longevity of the perfume on the body is from 6 to 8 hours, with a medium sillage and projection , and an affordable price, and according to my opinion, it is the best men's perfume from Lacoste, it is the hidden gem.

Nowadays, I like it more as an office scent. But for people who like to be active. It's generic in the way montblanc scents are, but at the same time not overpowering so quite versatile. At its price point, definitely value for money. I think this and Lacoste black are the best."", 'Over the years, this remains my ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù fragrance for any occasion, anytime of the year.

Sort of clean in a fruit way. I laugh when people talk about other people stating that the performance is awful. It is awful. This is a do-nothing fragrance..because it does nothing. It is linear, when its dry it is gone unless it is on cloth and then you have to press nostrils on it to pick it up.  This is typical of Lacoste. The brand creates scents that smell kind of good but have no performance. I don't know if its a strategy to keep customers applying the frag all day long therefore going through extreme amounts and thus buying more.. but lacoste certainly doesn't apply anything into giving their releases any longevity. My dog has farts that last longer.  What I use this for: I keep it in the bathroom and spray it on the towels and that helps keep the room smelling fresh and when we use a towel it smells nice. That is it. It is a towel freshener. I won't even give it a rating. It is almost as bad as Zihr Courderoy. lacoste is nothing but a low budget / gym fragrance brand. So yeah, I am a brand snob. There... I said it."", 'Lacoste Pour Homme is one of my favorites. This has a unique smell, opens fruity with a warm spicy undertone.

Thumbs down for this one.', ""Found it at a discounters, so I thought I would give it a shot. The opening is a bit offensive due to how synthetic it smelled at first. Its a bit overwhelming. Initially, you get the great fresh smell of the top notes, but I would get whiffs of something artificial or synthetic. The plum, cinnamon and pepper is mostly what I smelled in the mid, but the dry down gets much sweeter. Vanilla was definitely the strongest base note, but there was also a decent amount of rum and musk to my nose. Its nothing mind blowing, but nothing offensive either. Its probably a safe choice for something like school or the office, especially during spring or fall. You might be able to wear this for summer if you're indoors. In no way does this smell bad, but I don't think you'd really get compliments for this one. I honestly rather use this as an air freshener for my room than actually wear it. 6.5/10.

In the opening you get bold plum along with faint citrus and some spices (a mildly fresh clean spiciness), the spiciness actually blends well with the sweeter notes as it makes the plum and apple notes not overly sweet (giving LPH masculinity).  LPH has a fresh cleanliness to it (from the musk, juniper & citrus) that supports its spicy notes (pink pepper cardamom and cinnamon) very well through the mid, the spiciness also gets slightly warm, as the plum sweetness remains, added with some slight creaminess (vanillas &/or sandlewood) and booziness (from the rum). To me, the mid is actually the best part of the fragrance because once it completely dries all the main notes which makes the fragrance good fade and you're mainly left with mild clean-musk and faint spicy/sweetness.

I'm just not a fan of warm spice colognes - personal preference I guess.

Great presentation with a great sweet plum and a very nice mature booze quality.. this stuff is amazing  Rating  9/10', 'Lacoste Pour Homme Men EDT opens with a moderate projection of sweet, citrus, fruity, spicy, and woody notes. The opening is delectable, fresh, mild, and pleasant. The bergamot and plum are the most noticeable opening fruity accords, particularly the plum, which makes the fragrance feel ‚Äútasty‚Äù. The bergamot accentuates the fruity note by adding a slight but noticeable sour and sharp touch. The fragrance has a noticeable aromatic sweetness which is the vanilla, and although is listed as a base note, it comes up as soon as the fragrance is applied. The grapefruit and apple are the least noticeable opening notes, just a whiff but there. As time passes, the bergamot subsides and the vanilla takes the lead; at this point, the sweet-spicy cinnamon and pink pepper become noticeable and follow closely the lead of the vanilla. Along with the spicy notes, there is a boozy touch that becomes more noticeable as the fragrance dries down, the combination of the vanilla and rum create a pleasant accord. The rest of the notes are there to provide support, some projection, and woody. The fragrance has a noticeable opening to dry-down change, the opening favors the citrus and fruity notes, these notes are sharp; but as they dry-down, they take one step back and the vanilla, rum, cinnamon, and pink pepper become noticeable. Additionally, the initial moderate projection lowers to soft. Once Lacoste Pour Homme Men EDT has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a soft projection, sweet (vanilla), boozy (rum), spicy (cinnamon, pink pepper) and fruity (plum) fragrance with woody, and citrus accords.

Im going to save this for the colder days.', 'As a female, I do not shy away from unisex and/or ""men\'s"" fragrances. This, to me, is not super masculine at all. It is this fruity, sweet (sweet in a natural way) and slightly spicy fragrance due to the cinnamon. This is a perfect day to day fragrance for both genders.', ""I don't like this. Right away I noticed the cinnamon note and it's all I smell. It isn't too cloying but it does bother me because I genuinely don't want my bf to smell like cinnamon. It also smells pretty old school."", ""There is something about this scent that leads my mind to a locker room at indoor swimming - could sound off putting, but I mean it in the best ways. I guess it's the sporty, steamy quality that reminds me of it. Or maybe it's because someone actually sprayed it once in a locker room I was in. It's a solid, masculine raw fruity scent. A winner in my book."", 'It\'s nice, pleasant, fresh & fruity. Reminiscent to me of Guy Laroche\'s Horizon. It\'s offensive and a good grab and go fragrance. It is not, and I don\'t think it\'s intended to be, a ""Wow"" what a fragrance type, and it doesn\'t have to be. A good, clean, fresh, Spring fragrance that is cheap enough to just have.', 'Great versatile cheapie with beautiful plum note. Even though I am not a big fan of vanilla note in fragrances it is my favorite Lacoste for sure. Longevity - moderate ~6 hours. Definitely worth a try.', 'This cologne smells GREAT. The closest thing I can think of that smells similar is Black Ice air freshener. So if you like how Black Ice smells, you will like this.', 'One of the best office fragrances in the market. Beautiful smell, non ofensive and with nice longevity and projection. And its cheap.If you want to please almost everyone in your work with a nice scent, this is a safe choice. Summer and spring only.', ""Bringin' back sweet memories... This is an oldie but greatie. Had this years back pulled the trigger again and this competes with some higher end designer/niche fragrances that I have. Unique, clean, fun and office friendly.  8/10"", ""This frag made me very sad. I guess my nose can't pick it up but after many YouTube reviews, and decent reviews on here I was excited to find this at Marshall's only to unbox it and the scent was so faint I barely could enjoy it.  Nothing smelled bad, just couldn't smell it. Maybe an expired bottle if that's a thing or a bad batch? Returned it no problem thankfully."", ""I had to check the name on the bottle after sniffing this from my skin such is the sweet and somewhat heavy character of the scent. I always expect Lacoste fragrances to be pretty light with a lot of citrus and floral notes, warm weather fare.  This is something altogether different and makes me think of more cold weather scents, many have mentioned Boss Bottled and although I don't really get that it could be like a cross between that and something like Bentley for Men (Intense, as that's the only I know), the booze and leathery vibe is what does it. Another one that comes to mind Le Male Essence de Parfum but I guess LPH is really it's own beast. Not for me but unlike the reviewer below I got extremely good performance on my skin (from a store tester), maybe it helps that the weather has (finally) cooled down a bit."", 'Dont buy recent batches. Last only 2hrs then skin scent 1hr. I just bought it due to positive reviews. On the opening its plum & spicy 30 mins & its nice. After that its a Boss bottled vibe, beautiful. Then it takes a different path, nice a bit leathery with dried fruit but only about 1hr, then its gone. Even on clothes 3hrs then gone. I sprayed twice on 5 points... its gone 3 hrs. I you want the mid scent, buy boss bottled 6-8 hrs lasting. Im done with Lacoste, it comes at the same level of Guess or cheap celebrity fragances. I never had a fragrance disappear on clothes after 3hrs. Dont buy recent batches. WTF I had better & cheaper.', ""My signature scent in high school (2005-2006).

Cozy, delicious fragrance with a kick. I normally do not like sweet scents, but the plum, apple, vanilla combination is striking in this one and makes it therefore a special blend. Its comforting, relaxing and sexy. Signature material here.', 'A plum pepper bomb that reminds me of a fruitier version of Ferragamo F Black... seriously.

To me is a sweet and fresh scent which is nice, this is the 2nd Lacoste fragrance that I owned the very first one is the Style in Play. I liked the plum on this fragrance with Vanilla mixed in is pleasing and not cloying. Is a nice release from Lacoste it would be nice if this was a EDP instead of a EDT, and is a must have.

On this fragrance both plum and vanilla are well blended and it stands out. I get the hint of the fruity and rum vibe in the background which is there to my nose. But again the Plum, Vanilla and Rum are the main players here on this fragrance, to me the Rum is buried on the background with the Vanilla and Plum and again the Rum is there. My overall rating on this fragrance I will give this fragrance some love due to the Plum and Vanilla combo I will rate it 8 out of 10, and the longevity/performance it will be 8.25 out of 10, I went a have dose on the sprays around 9-11, lasted on my skin as a skin scent around 9-11+ hrs which is semi-beast mode. Again is a must have if you love the combo of Plum and Vanilla with rum. Is a superb fragrance with a cheap/bargain of a price.', ""I am still undecided on this one... Sometimes this stuff turns powdery to my nose which I hate. I hate powdery frags more than anything.  Sometimes it becomes a soft, sandalwood/cedar/vanilla.  It's definitely not an extremely spicy frag. It's very laid back and cold in nature. I think it's nice, but I am still unsure."", 'When i first get this fragrance i was underwhelmed.. its nothing special.. but after a few more wearing, i started to like it much more.. i do get the plum n some other freshness in the beginning.. after 10 to 15 minutes the freshness fades away but the plum stays with a pepperry and vanillic background. I dont really get the rum note.. no rum like man in black by bvlgari.. so if you thinking of purchasing this for the rum note i suggest look elsewhere.. but if you looking to enjoy the plum sweetness and a tinged of tard sour smell with the smooth vanilla background then this is a good option.. suitable for modern man age 25+', 'I find this one excellent, especially after about an hour or two. The opening had a good spice to it (not peppery).. and I find myself reaching for this in the fall/winter months. I‚Äôd rather spray Lacoste white if I were to stay in the same house during spring/summer. Just my 2. Longevity is great.. projection is great.. dry down is really great. It smooths out into a vanilla scent on my skin that‚Äôs super creamy. Cuts through the cold weather, and it‚Äôs not a compliment monster, it‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúwarm‚Äù feeling frag imo. Good all around er. Overall a great warm, spicey, sweet, semi fresh scent.. that could work in many different settings. Age group would be college and up, maybe high school but it‚Äôs a little spicey for a teenager I‚Äôd think. Then again I wore Perry Ellis 360 green in high school and choked out half my class. Bottom line.. great juice.', 'Love...Love...Love me some Lacoste pour homme!!', 'Well well well, what a wonderful aroma this has with the plum note taking the front seat. A lovely blend of woods and fruit that for the price is fantastic! Easy blind buy, hard not to like!! 8/10', 'You don\'t find plum in too many men\'s fragrances. In Lacoste Pour Homme it is done reasonably well. This is a dumb reach type of a fragrance for the warmer months, but I particularly like it for the Spring.  Upon the first spray, I mostly get a huge grapefruit note. It is so big and juicy that it drowns out most everything else. That lasts for about 5 to 10 minutes and then I get the plum. It is a nice fruity nuance without being too sweet. The spices are there like the cardamom and pink pepper, but the fruits are the major players. At the complete dry down, it smells like most other mass appealing fragrances with vanilla, sandalwood, and cedar. I do not pick up the rum note at all. I would say this is pretty generic, but it is a ""generic"" fragrance done right. As with many citrus fresh fragrances, it only lasts on the skin for about 5 to 6 hours, if that, and only projects for about half of those hours.  I give this a 6.5/10. I really like it and am glad to have it in my collection. I use it frequently in the Spring, but also sometimes in the Fall and Winter (the high Summer heat would probably turn this sour). It reminds me of the kind of image that Lacoste is going for; clean crisp polos at the country club, straight-laced attitude, sipping on a half-and-half (Arnold Palmer), shooting the sh*t with some buddies. There are better freshies out there, but for an office or casual fragrance, you can\'t go wrong.', 'If you are like me and citrus/bergamot frags quickly turn sour on your skin then you understand how difficult it is to find a ""summer"" spray and go. There aren\'t many choices left besides the lavender--my grandma wore this, the soapy cheap, shower gel frags that disappear after 2 hrs, or the super popular Sauvage that everyone and their brother is wearing. I admit, I\'ve spent far too much $ lately trying to find an alternative.  I believe I have found it with Lacoste Pour Homme. Although there is some citrus in the opening, it quickly gives way to the green apple and plum. The fruit dominance lasts for about 30-45 minutes. After that, the cardamom and warmth comes up just enough to soften the sweet fruit. A bit synthetic at skin level, but the moderate sillage comes across as more sophisticated and well blended. Longevity is 6-7 hours. An honest 6-7.  You aren\'t going to knock someone out with this but it\'s apple and plum freshness make it a great summer choice. Definitely shoots above it\'s price.', 'This sexy fragrance is under the radar and is very unique,the plum note is very smooth,at first I gave this scent a 8 out of 10 but after receiving so many compliments and getting 7 plus hours each wear I have to give this a 10 out of 10,u can find this easily online for 25 bucks or less,its probably the best cheapy but goodie u will ever purchase.......peace', 'This is one of the first ""name brand"" fragrances I purchased and was one that made me see how much better higher quality fragrances can be over my typical Avon scents. Now looking back, it isn\'t a high-quality scent compared to high-end designers and niche stuff, but that does not mean it\'s a bad scent at all. It is actually quite amazing for its price. Sweet vanilla and plum with rum. Slightly spicy due to the cinnamon and cardamon which adds depth to the rum note. The sandalwood and vanillagives it a creamy vibe, but not gourmand. It is a classy fragrance that is simple, but simple does not mean boring. It can be dressed up or down. It probably works best in the spring, but you could do a late fall/winter with it as well since the plum and rum are very noticeable. Would be good for a date night fragrance year round. Scent 8/10 (simple, yet versatile) Sillage 6/10 (about arm length, but this is not aloud scent and it not made to be a sillage beast) Longevity 7/10 (I can get 6-7 hours out of it) Value 8/10 (you can get this for around 25-30 USD at discounters and that is a great value for something this versatile and long-lasting.) Presentation 7/10 (The bottle is nice and heavy. It looks refined, but simple.I almost want to say it had a magnetic cap, but I lost it and can\'t recall) Overall, a decent blind buy if you are looking for a simple versatile scent that is inoffensive and will get you compliments. If you don\'t like rum notes, stay away. Probably best for 25+.', ""I felt like I knew how it would smell before it arrived. A bit disappointed, but I should know by now! It smells nice, but not what I imagined. Not sure if this makes sense, but it's like the smell is fuzzy or fractured, like a mixed bag of sweets. I imagined a clean, sharp plum note. Describing smells is hard isn't it! Anyway, my expectations are neither here nor there. It's a nice scent. Sweet and fruity and ideal for a bracing winter walk in the city. Very good value and should be owned by all professional child catchers and pied piper types."", 'Good scent! reminds me a lot of Hugo Boss Bottled.', 'God I hate this fragrance, gives me a headache.', ""I agree with Zuma_Moon in that this fragrance is underrated. It is a great scent that is extremely versatile, IMO. It can be dressed up or down in any season, day or night (although wouldn't work as a clubbing scent). I find it fresh and classy. Hard to offend anyone while wearing this. I believe this utilitarian aspect is what hurts it. It is not ground breaking or earth shattering. It is a workhorse of a fragrance that smells nice and gets the job done....and I'm OK with that."", 'Really pleasant and sweet vanillafragrance. I think it¬¥s kind of ""mature"", best for 30+ I guess. Good longevity and sillage. Safe blindbuy', 'I feel this scent does not get mentioned enough on here, its criminally underrated imo. I always have this close to hand in my cabinet as its an easy non offensive classy smelling scent. Ideally an Autumn/Winter scent but can be worn all year no problems, suitable for any age too. Opens with a lovely citrus and plum blast, then progresses into a warm spicy vanilla scent which lasts around 6 hours with 6-8 generous sprays. Great quality scent for the price and definitely a people pleaser.... 8/10', ""SWEET - PLUM + APPLE - VANILLA - RUM This is probably the sweetest fragrance I have in my collection, maybe even sweeter than the lovely Cuba Prestige cigar I have lying around somewhere. Because of it's sweetness, it leans more towards Fall & Winter wear. But the drydown turns this into an understated vanilla+rum base that could work in daytime settings like work. Just make sure you get past the initial blast before judging it. The initial hit is a strong, in-your-face, alcoholic/synthetic opening that is VERY SWEET. Wait until it dries down and then you can enjoy it. Whatever you do, don't spray this on yourself and then immediately present yourself to people - you won't get the reactions you want. Spray yourself at least 15 to 20 minutes before going out and you'll be fine."", ""This is a clean and soft plum fragrance. I smell Plum with touches of Vanilla and Rum. The base has some sandalwood but its very underneath everything else. Its an ok fragrance. It's unique for that plum note but nothing great for me. 6/10"", 'one of the best fragrence ever', 'recently buy this juice. in my personal opinion LPH (batch 2015) is combination from versace pour homme mix with hugo boss energise. fresh, sweet, very safe and versatile.', 'It\'s like Boss Bottled with less citrus and added booze notes. The plum is nice and the vanilla is solid. Arm\'s length projection and good longevity (10+ hours.) There are few fragrances under $40USD that give you this much performance and depth. One of those ""dumb reach"" fragrances that I think everyone should have.', ""I'm not a big fan of Lacoste frag's,but this one is realy nice... simple,but elegant and sofisticated,very pleasant, longevity is 7h+ and projection on medium side.."", 'Has it ever happened to you that you do not find that fragrance put on for reasons of ... Climate, occasion, or mood? This fragrance solves that aromatic dilemma. I do not know why I associate the fragrances of Lacoste in the same line of Nautica, Guess or Diesel and No with other designer houses like Versace or Chanel to put an example. The bottle is simple but ... Incredibly beautiful and elegant. To me; it looks like Chanel\'s Allure pour Homme, only at the beginning (not everyone likes this similarity) and it is not less true the resemblance to Dior Homme Eau, especially in the final drying and certain vibe to F Ferragamo Black Maybe for the pepper and the apple that both share. What most perceives my pseudose nose is a pleasant smell like ""vanilla powdery"", a little of the ""spicy"" of cinnamon and actually quite sweet, but not the cloying, only to notice that it can be very penetrating to the nostrils and Intrusive sometimes, it happened to me. Lacoste pour Homme is not a pompous fragrance or ""all star"", does not pretend to be what it is not, it is not hidden behind a brand to sell, rather it is a ""UTILITY"" perfume ... of those that we apply when we are about to leave in a hurry and have the time over. This alligator is quite versatile, for the office or the gym, formal and informal, at any time of day or season of the year, even age range. My bottle is 2013, with good projection and nuclear longevity. Not that I love it, but I can not deny the good quality of this ""silver crocodile"".', ""I love this stuff. The more I use it, the more I appreciate its versatility. It goes well anywhere--not overpowering, yet it has terrific staying power and becomes a gorgeous skin scent as it concludes. This is my go-to, every-day spray. Don't let the name deter you from considering this fantastic offering from Lacoste. LPH's opening could be characterized as being somewhat synthetic--though not in a bad way. Then, as LPH begins to settle-in, it presents a powdery, peppered plum persona--emphasis on the plumb--that lingers on the skin for a nice long time. It's not entirely complex, but it is very nicely balanced. It's a safe scent that can be worn ANY time without worries. I absolutely recommend this little beauty."", 'Classy! I like this one a lot! The smell reminds me of a lighter version of Mont Blanc Individuel. They would be interchangeable imo.', ""So good,that plum note makes this cologne unique. It's great for spring rotation day and night. Longevity is ok. Skin scent after 2-3 hours. This is a sexy one"", ""Very versatile.. I literally couldn't put this to a particular time of year or day. Fantastic performance. Lasts all day, and projects for hours! Another one that people just dismiss.. when in actual fact it's a real gem!!"", ""So originally I dismissed this scent as this has a semi-harsh opening and is very synthetic. But this is a scent you have to give at least 2 wearings before you judge whether or not you like it.  Admittedly my opinion changed on this because of the compliments I received ! I put this on in the morning for the first time and liked it but didn't think it was special but then 5 hours later I received a compliment at work and then when I got home my girlfriend buried her face in my chest and said this might be one of her new favorites. She however didn't care for this when I sprayed it in the morning. This starts off with a fresh but zingy opening that's slightly synthetic but not completely off putting but still not entirely pleasant. Once this dries down though you get a very soft,vanilla scent that's masculine and also has a fresh edge to it as well. To my nose this smells like a fresh vanilla scented dryer sheet. The drydown to this is very addicting and pleasant and has a great balance of being fresh and sweet without being sickly sweet. My girlfriend said it's very comforting but also very attractive as well and reminded her of boss bottled but she likes this better. Performance on this is great ! It lasts 8-12 hours and projects very well. I thought it was below average but I've been complimented when I thought it disappeared which makes me believe your nose becomes nose blind to this pretty easily.  (Also 2-3 sprays is all you need and less is more with this scent) Overall rating --- 8 out of 10 ! Great scent for a great price that smells great and lasts all day"", 'I blind bought this for my spring rotation but after a smelling it I decided it would be perfect for the winter. Besides, in the spring I much prefer fragrances with green notes, fresh vetiver, grassy and earthy scents like TDH. Lacoste PH does not fit my spring preference, nor does it fit my fall and summer fragrances, so I put it in my winter rotation and it\'s perfect, mainly because of the gorgeous vanilla. The plum note in this is very well done, and gives me hints of the approaching warm weather. For some reason I detect a honey in this, but I don\'t see it listed in the notes? But again, I\'ve never been one to detect notes that well. One of my favorite things about this fragrance is it\'s fairly unique. My collection is about 130 bottles and not one of them smells like this one. If there\'s one thing I hate is when I blind buy a fragrance only to find out it smells too close to one I already have. Lacoste Pour Homme has it\'s own character for sure. It\'s a nice break from the more traditional winter fragrances such as Polo Green, Quorom, Dior Homme, Interlude Man and other smokey, oud, leather, woodsy, sweet colognes I enjoy wearing in the cold days of winter. I rate Lacoste a 8/10 because it\'s a very nice scent, unique, versatile, and very affordable. Absolutely blind buy worthy. Enjoy! :) Update 1/16/18 - Yesterday I wore 3 sprays of Lacoste Pour Homme (2 on chest and 1 behind neck) and I got compliments all day. First on the train, a young lady asked me what cologne I was wearing. During lunch a guy said to me ""my wife would love that fragrance you are on what is it."" Later in the day at the office my secretary said I smelled amazing. In the evening I went to the gym and although I couldn\'t smell the fragrance anymore, a gym member said to me ""that cologne smells so good."" I don\'t think I ever got 3 compliments in one day on a fragrance. So I guess the rumors are true, people really like this fragrance, particularly the ladies, More so than I originally thought.', '8/10 nice scent I get like 6 to 7 hrs with it.', ""This scent... Is very clean: I can smell the granny smith apple mixed with, what I can say...liquid soap scent. With a hint of rum, which you can't really pick up. Unless you knew it was there, unless you looked up the notes listed on the site. It's a very safe scent to wear. But seems like something I would wear as a teenager to early years of college. Sillage about a foot away tops(unless you overdo it). Last about four to six hours at best. I'd wear this to the gym, market, etc. This won't impress anyone. But you'll smell like a fabric softener sheet. Overall...Would I buy this again? No. I bought a 3.3 oz bottle for $28.76, and I feel jip (robbed or letdown)."", 'I had this for about 2-3 weeks and found it too sharp for my taste. I\'m a nut for sweet, fruity scents, but unfortunately I did not find this one fit either categories well. It\'s certainly fresh and office/business appropriate, though it\'s not the ""playful man in a dress shirt"" I expected. If you will, I get a ""serious business professional"" vibe from this one similar to F by Ferragamo Black. This is a great scent for the aspiring gentleman!', 'Cold weather freshie... weird to say, but it\'s true. I\'m gonna have a tough time working this into my rotation, because the colder seasons are usually the starting gun for me to wear some of the most interesting scents in my wardrobe, so Lacoste Pour Homme has a lot to compete with considering that it\'s too sweet and cloying for anything above 60F temp.  The plum is interesting, albeit rather synthetic. It\'s what makes this a not-your-usual fresh scent, especially since it sits on top of a dark/toasty/burnt type of vanilla. Just typing all of that out made me think this fragrance is more interesting than it is, but it\'s actually somewhat generic to an unfortunate degree. This allows it to have a youthful vibe. Safe, yes, but not overly impressive to those around you.  I got 1oz for $15, so I\'m not about to throw my hands up in disappointment. I can wear this to the supermarket, or when I\'m trying to be nondescript in a casual setting. You may find that it\'s an interesting change of pace from other Fall/Winter/cooler-Spring type scents, but there\'s just so many other options for that role. It might actually smell kind of classy on a teenager, so the younger crowd should perhaps consider this as a stepping stone or ""middle ground"" fragrance... something in the vein of Boss Bottled (functionally, not in terms of scent), but perhaps slightly less dated.  Performance is average on all fronts in my experience, with a generic vanilla skin scent lasting quite a while after the fresh aspects have burned out.', 'It is remarkable fragrance !!! The striking characteristic sweet ..... but I think a good reason, like, say, oriental fragrance case !! Erotic, sensual, emotional ..... but it may be the signature scent !! Particularly balanced ingredients !!  The wintry atmosphere, apples, plums, cinnamon summery atmosphere is balanced by the citrus chord. Sandalwood, vanilla sweetens until the pink pepper and juniper spice it ... All this will add rum to make her a unique and aromatic !! I must say that brilliant invention !! The first time can be a bit ""too much"" sweet SILLAGE but adequate good seasons environment ""takes all"" the crocodile .......

The longevity on my skin is absolutely fantastic (8-12 hrs) and it projects nicely also.

Very synthetic and somewhat dry. Not as sweet imo as other people mention - Joop, Paco, JPG Ultra are all far far sweeter but the light plum note is indeed interesting.

Cheers!', ""I got a decant of this and have worn it 3 times. I like this very much, however on me it becomes a skin scent almost instantly. None to little projection. So for that reason I probably won't buy a bottle of this. This is sweet and fruity and like someone else said has a slight soda pop feel to it. I can't pinpoint the fruit that I get from this. It's very safe and non offensive and would work in most situations. It is very sexy I think.

By far my favorite fragrance in all lacoste line. First spray gives me a plum with a booze of rum and a light grapefruit and vanilla. This can be worn on night out and cool chilly weather.

Ladies love this scent i get compliments when i wear it.After wearing this for hour on so i get that rochas man vibe to it which is awesome. I can smell vanilla as it dries down.If you dont like sweet fragrances dont buy this. Overall this fragrance is sexy sweet seductive scent that draws compliments. Projection and longevity are good.

I'm pretty happy that so many frags work on me, it is pretty rare that something doesn't, so it really stands out when something goes bad. Plus, I live in a warm, humid climate, and that doesn't seem to be what a lot of reviewers here think is the ideal place for LPH. I'm going with the reviewers who say this is more of a winter frag, since I can't see this happening in hot weather. Lacoste Pour Homme was confusingly bad on me. It smelled almost like someone got a lunch meal to go from a deli and there was a meaty sandwich with condiments and sides in a bag emanating from my wrist. Sad, because I had hopes for LPH. If for some reason I moved someplace with a winter, I might try it again. If this works for some people on hot, humid spring and summer days, more power to them. I would caution against someone blind buying this one though. In my limited experience, you really have to careful about any frag with strong vanilla in hot environments."", 'Absolutely Amazing! The Best by Lacoste in my opinion. The mix of Vanilla and Rum is kinda Awesome. I got few but not many compliments wearing it.

I say the name and she replies - ""It\'s Sexy!"". BUT i don\'t really got a good longevity in summer days nor a good sillage. So i guess its a Winter Fragrance afterall.

When i got it one month ago i tried it immediately... it was a bad experience, the heat with the sweetness didn't work right at all  Today as i noticed the cool fall weather outside my window, i decided to give it another chance. The opening was too sweet for me..i thought i made a mistake that will bother me all day (had no time to have a second shower)  As i got out to work, it started to dry down and to give me these pulses of dry sweet almost white chocolaty vibes...oh my god ....much much much better than i expected it's a real pleasant feeling that it gives... now am sitting in my office completely relaxed overwhelmed with the very smooth and sweet spice/vanilla/apple atmosphere ..... so for all those people who hated Lacoste pour homme from the first sniff, please don't repeat my mistake...follow the first 3 tips and be surprised of how wonderful journey it can take you"", ""Sweet and unpleasant.

The spicy notes kick really soon right after then the cologne settles for a lemon-ish citrus notes with sandalwood and a vanilla dominant note from here to drydown.

The notes in Lacoste Pour Homme come into play a lot better IMO. This fragrance is not bad at all.

It's a unique combination to me, but I'm not a big fan of these kinds of fragrances. I like the smell but I'm not sure how well it would work for hours on end. I sprayed a tiny amount on before I went to sleep and never experienced the drydown, just a strong opening. It's been compared to Boss Bottled/#6, but I like this one better, I think because the wood isn't as strong and it's a bit more complex. I also like the strong notes in this one, though I generally don't like ones this sweet. Here, the juniper and rum seem to keep the sweetness in check. The plum and spices provide a kind of tint to the fragrance but are never clear as notes to me. I'll have to update after I've given it a regular wearing. UPDATE: With a regular wearing what I'll say is that I don't like the first 20 minutes or so but then it settles in and is pleasant.

I gave this bottle away to a co-worker with a college bound son.', 'Lacoste Pour Homme is a very well constructed and balanced citric aquatic that though not innovative or uniquely original in conception, is outstandingly executed and one of the best aquatics on the market. The beautiful opening of citrus and apple integrates very well with the juniper and cinnamon that never offends and manages to hold a very reserved and balanced personality without ever overwhelming. One of the best uses of apple I have come across in a fragrance, it seems to give the grapefruit a bass from which to balance it against the spicier middle notes. Incredibly pleasing, becomes somewhat linear once the vanilla ripens over the middle and top notes, but the vanilla only seems to add a creamy note without losing its balance or becoming overly assertive. The sandalwood and cedarwood make for a light foundation that allows the vanilla and musk to come through unmolested. This give Lacoste Pour Homme a lighter feel but because the scent is so well balanced it doesn¬¥t detract from the overall scent in the slightest. Incredibly versatile, pleasing and refined. Longevity is not bad, 5-6 hours is the standard, though on some skin chemistries this one never goes beyond a skin scent after the initial thirty minutes of application so a blind buy may not work for everyone. The epitome of well executed, well blended and organically based.', ""I detect a nice, sweet and tart citrus in the beginning, almost like a lemon head. This is followed by vanilla and a spice that I can really feel. It's not overpowering at all. It's a very gentlemanly, warm scent that's an all around winner in my book."", ""Just had this last week got a free sample.  So let's see, Opening is kinda sweet with a dash of citrus. Then after an hour it kinda smells a little spicy then dries down to a nice woody vanilla finish. Projection is not that superb, which isn't a major problem. I can't really tell if the majority of the sweetness comes from the vanilla or rum since I always have this mysterious feeling when smelling it during after the dry down. To sum things up, a very nice everyday perfume can be worn day or not (though I recommend it during the day). Not to intruding or not too shy just a well balanced scent in my opinion.

I'm not an expert and I don't claim to know what each of the above listed notes smells like. That being said, for me, it starts out warm with the blended notes of cinnamon and vanilla. Just the right touch of vanilla for me as I'm not a fan of the rich, sickeningly sweet, gourmand vanilla. Maybe it's the pink pepper that keeps the vanilla in check, and as a result I don't consider this a vanilla scent overall. After about fifteen minutes the almost melon like grapefruit starts coming into the mix. Nice blend. I don't detect the apple at all. I have to say that each note has a degree of synthetic quality to it, but this is not a negative. I think this is what makes each note fit together so well to create a unique scent that in dry down is cool on my skin, and has a powdery quality to it. Not sweet, but a contradictory soft yet metal element. Very clean and understated. I like it more each time I wear it. It is not overtly masculine, but definitely not feminine.

Its comforting, relaxing and sexy. Signature material here.', ""So originally I dismissed this scent as this has a semi-harsh opening and is very synthetic. But this is a scent you have to give at least 2 wearings before you judge whether or not you like it.  Admittedly my opinion changed on this because of the compliments I received ! I put this on in the morning for the first time and liked it but didn't think it was special but then 5 hours later I received a compliment at work and then when I got home my girlfriend buried her face in my chest and said this might be one of her new favorites. She however didn't care for this when I sprayed it in the morning. This starts off with a fresh but zingy opening that's slightly synthetic but not completely off putting but still not entirely pleasant. Once this dries down though you get a very soft,vanilla scent that's masculine and also has a fresh edge to it as well. To my nose this smells like a fresh vanilla scented dryer sheet. The drydown to this is very addicting and pleasant and has a great balance of being fresh and sweet without being sickly sweet. My girlfriend said it's very comforting but also very attractive as well and reminded her of boss bottled but she likes this better. Performance on this is great ! It lasts 8-12 hours and projects very well. I thought it was below average but I've been complimented when I thought it disappeared which makes me believe your nose becomes nose blind to this pretty easily.

The actual smell is fine. Its nothing ground breaking. Sort of clean in a fruit way. I laugh when people talk about other people stating that the performance is awful. It is awful. This is a do-nothing fragrance..because it does nothing. It is linear, when its dry it is gone unless it is on cloth and then you have to press nostrils on it to pick it up.  This is typical of Lacoste. The brand creates scents that smell kind of good but have no performance. I don't know if its a strategy to keep customers applying the frag all day long therefore going through extreme amounts and thus buying more.. but lacoste certainly doesn't apply anything into giving their releases any longevity. My dog has farts that last longer.  What I use this for: I keep it in the bathroom and spray it on the towels and that helps keep the room smelling fresh and when we use a towel it smells nice.

I don't know how it was when it was first released, or where all the notes went, but this latest incarnation (batch NH25) is totally linear on my skin. After a few hours, it dries down to a freshly laundered clothes smell and that's it. Unfortunately, I got myself a massive 150ml bottle, because it was under 30 Euros. So not worth it. It's now destined to become a very expensive toilet spray for guests to cover up the smell they've made. The only positive thing I can say is the bottle design is nice, and the juice is a very pleasant blue."", ""I received a sample of this in 2008, and was blown away by it.

I couldn't believe this was the same thing I sampled. A harsh, synthetic blast that smelled just like any cleaning product. I could tell that it was the same cologne as the sample, but somehow the concentration and balance must have been different. I ended up giving most of the bottle away (about 12 years ago). A part of me still wonders if I can maybe get that sample 'version' again. If it wasn't for the sample that I liked so much, this would be tossed into the hate category."", ""Sweet and fresh.

Hard to describe, it was a long time ago since I last smelled it. The notes on here say fruity, I guess it is. I have a tendency to gravitate toward citrusy, at least I did when I was younger.  Nowadays, I gravitate more toward woody or warm spicy scents. This is an excellent cologne! It was my intro into Dunhill, a good designer. I stopped wearing it, but I wore it for a long time. I don't know why I stopped wearing it. I think I prefer to switch up scents! Great summer and spring cologne! Definitely a more aquatic and ozonic one.

The litchi/lotus combination with the both citruses is just too good to be true.that alone makes this fragrance worth the price. The sea notes and the addition of rose wood is just a match made in heaven.The rosewood emulates sooo many sweet woody aromatic nuances and the orange note is just there to compliment the top notes.sea notes make it salty/metallic but only an appropriate hint of it. The rosewood and lotus are by far THE MAIN STARS of this fragrance they‚Äôre the literal glue to this whole pyramid it brings it all together. The base notes compliment everything well together but not as good as the rosewood and lotus they create a sandalwood type of nuance on it which i solemnly adore.

It‚Äôs something you could wear on a holiday to a tropical resort, although I envision it on someone in their teens.

Plus Plus & Silver Scent have this aggravatingly ""purple"" grape accord that just agitates me and I can actually say that I\'d rather wear nothing than wear those fragrances. Desire Red is just as screechy with a metallic accord replacing the ""purple"" scent. Dunhill corrected this path with Desire Blue by removing the metallic accord of Desire Red and toning down the ""grape"" syrup accord of Plus Plus & Silver Scent. Desire Blue is completely likeable but still carrying a boisterous personality. A few reviews wrote this off as ""laundry detergent"" and I can completely see that aspect of Desire Blue, however, it\'s not soapy... just soft and fresh like most generic liquid laundry detergents. Desire Blue opens with sweet, juicy lychee, and aquatic accords. It\'s fresh and fun. A bit jarring due to it\'s projection, but good.

The litchi and lotus add that something a little more interesting up top. Performance on Tread & Miller's Aquatic is better than the Dunhill because it is an EDP concentration. Worth getting if you reside in South Africa."", 'I bought this for my hubby and I love this fragrance. It\'s a perfect everyday fragrance, that works best in between seasons, summer and spring.

I had seen this on sale for 20 dollars for at least 10 years at local pharmacies and never thought to look it up because I'm not generally into blue aquatic fragrances. When I did look it up, I saw that it had a lychee note and was super intrigued. By that time it was gone from the pharmacy shelves so I paid a few dollars more for a large size tester.  Best value ever. The lychee note is there at the opening but disappears into the wonderful blend later on. The tonka in this is heavy handed though and carries you through the mid until the musk comes in.  The ingredients, chemicals in this allow me to detect it for a full 12 hours across all stages however the projection reduces after the first two.  Because of the lychee, this will be used by me frequently. It's a great replacement for my Versace Pour Homme, and Ferragamo AE, this is just more interesting to me.

But not in a bad way. Just don't go crazy on the atomizer and spray yourself 15-20 times. Very simplistic, yet very modern. It smells as if it could've been released yesterday. Not groundbreaking, but for $13 you can't complain; it smells like it could be easily double the price you can find it for at a Ross. It's mass appealing, and like the original Desire, it has great projection for the first 2 hours. On my skin, it's very aquatic and tropical fruity in the top with a light floral background. The mid is still aquatic but with a slightly sweet and resinous backbone lightly sprinkled with something woody. The base is quite wispy, smells like a faint mixture of tonka, amber, and musk. Performs well even through reformulations (I have a KK15 batch), a good 8-10 hours every time I've worn it. It's strong enough to wear all year round: projects and lasts enough to cut through the cold with more sprays, aquatic and fruity enough for the warmer parts of the year. Day time only, unless your significant other is gaga over Desire Blue. Very casual fragrance, more for going out to the beach, hanging with friends, likable enough to be used in the office (not too many sprays though). Too strong to be used after the gym, and doesn't come off clean but more marine. Anyone could wear it, but geared more for the younger crowd. Stood the test of time nearly 20 years later.

This differs from other blue fragrances as the shower gel and aquatic accords are not as dialed up as the fruity sweetness accords are. It‚Äôs also lacking the sharp ambroxan smell, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your preferences. It wears somewhat thick and heavy, yet it's still smooth.

It's a traditional aquatic fragrance but this has a little more backbone than some of the newer aquatics today. The sour ocean tinge in this goes in really nice with the fruits. It's a great fragrance and I think it's unisex as well. This is great for spring and summer. Honestly this is an all time great from the early 2000's along with Desire Red. I give this a 86/100.

This actually has a very unique opening that's very fresh,but also sweet and fruity and this has a fresh laundry smell but it smells like a laundry detergent that's maybe a tropical laundry detergent smell. The lichti in this is very unique and helps this be different BUT in the mid it's also slightly off putting as it causes the scent to a have a very faint rotten fruit note.  The drydown in this is the best part as that sharp,rotten fruit note you get in the mid fades and what remains is that fresh,laundry vibe you got in the opening only it's a lot more smooth and at this stage it almost smells like a unisex scent as I can also see women wearing this and enjoying this as well.  Performance on this is great ! On my skin this performs borderline beast mode for 2 hours and projects well for an additional 2 hours following that. Blue also lasts on my skin a total of 6-10 hours. Overall rating--- 6.5 out of 10 ! It's a nice scent that's actually quite unique and it performs well BUT it does come off a bit feminine and the mid of this fragrance almost causes me to dislike this scent.

The base notes are overshadowed by the the lychee and oranges, and thats one thing I love about it, as I really find it annoying when perfumes turn into ambroxane and unrefined synthetic coumarin smell, which is not the case here. Excellent projection and longevity, very heavy stuff. I think its to do with memory more than the actual smell here, but this one puts a smile on my face, and thats more than enough for me !', ""The armoa chemicals used in this one were too much for me, generating an unpleasant experience. I did detect some of the original Desire and I was hoping the base would be nice, but those strong aroma chemicals that I encountered at first never dissipated enough for me to appreciate anything the perfumer was trying to do here. Fortunately, I found an old sample and it didn't cost me more than perhaps a few pennies."", ""An aquatic version of DIESEL PLUS PLUS, but instead uses green apple instead of red apple. Opens with gasoline aquatic note then settles into some generic cool water or wings type scent. It's good and I always get complimented but I don't feel like it's me.

To me it is not aquatic but reminds me of green forest and lush grass. Not very intense but soft and beautiful. I perfer it to wear in intimate moments as it mixes with my body smell beatifully. It always fetch compliments from my partners and I feel them sniffing it with conscious effort when near to my body."", 'scent : 8/10 sillage : 7/10 longevity :7/10 70% day / 30% night fragrance', ""Picked this up at Burlington for super cheap on clearance. No wonder no one else picked it up and there's 3 left...it smells awful to me. The lychee is rotten in this. I thought it would smell wonderful, I love lychee. Makes me think of an aquatic version of the original Desire, has the same woody smell even though teak wood isn't listed on this one, but has rotten lychee in it instead of apple. Seriously, I can't get over that. Once it dries down it smells a little better, but all I can think of is that lychee in the beginning and it totally turns me off. Getting rid of this as soon as I can. You may have better results with this, so if you find it for dirt cheap, it's worth a try."", ""Gosh great bottle, I think Carolina Herrera CH Prive is based on this bottle. It is cool, minty woodsy.

Unfortunately I found that the opening of Dunhill desire blue is way too sweet in a cloying, candy-ish, synthetic way that makes you feel dizzy. In my opinion, this one would be miles better if the lychee note in the openning has more sourness kick that would make you feel a lot more refreshing. I live in a country where you can easily find seasonal lychees for a cheap price and believe me, the lychee note in this one, without the sourness of the fruit, is fake and cloying.  Not a typical blue summer fragrances. So, that might be good if you are looking for a summer fragrance that is a bit unique. The middle and dry down is a bit more acceptable though but the sweet dizzy opening will stay with you for quite a long time and you can still feel parts of it later on too. Good longevity and decent enough sillage.', 'To add....A lovely silage exudes from this scent - very addictive.', 'I would have to agree with a lot of the reviews that can point the notes. Now whether or not you appreciate or like this Desire ""Blue"" or not is up to each nose. It definitely does start off with a nice citrusy, orange and berry feel with mixes of the sea and rosewood. It is much lighter than the original, obviously for spring time . There is no way I would call this a sporty fragrance. And I think what makes it different from a lot of the other blue aquatics is that on the drydown it has a little more heavy sent that separates it from fragrances I would associate with those 25 and under. Alfred Dunhill is a mature image. I think they captured that here but the synthetic aldehydes make me not rank it up there and probably won\'t buy it again. The other thing is I find it to be a whole lot weaker than the original. Maybe it\'s because I wear when it\'s warmer outside, but something just doesn\'t carry or project very well with this.', ""Desire Blue is a very nice citrus/aquatic. It has a light, fruity, and soft opening. The heart of DB is the sea notes with a slight woody background. The litchi really stays noticeable throughout the length of this scent.

I can\'t pinpoint what I like about it; maybe it\'s that giant squid eyeball from the notes above. All in all, a nice wildcard aquatic that smells like a different fruit each time I wear it. It\'s a bit too sweet for me overall, but the rest is good enough to make up for it.', ""Well, I sprayed this on and liked it for about 30 seconds. Then I didn't. Then I did again.  There's something about the marine note in here that I don't care for. That fake synthetic saltiness calone can have seems to come and go. In a way it reminds me of Issey Miyake & Acqua di Gio, but I don't dislike it nearly as much as I do those two. The litchi note is definitely prominent. I get more bergamot than orange or mandarin. Lotus stands out as well and a pleasant warm woodiness from the rosewood. I'd say Desire Blue is better than your average aquatic."", ""Like the topnotes.

The litchi strongly grips Desire Blue from the beginning and overwhelms it with a synthetic dominance that destroys any chance of me enjoying this fragrance deep into the dry-down. It's green, yes, but it's also extremely high-pitched and synthetic. There's no real balance here as the mandarin and lotus serve as simple background noise and are too soft, allowing the litchi to overwhelm. What's left? Not much. A touch of woods and musk that still can't manage to extinguish the litchi and a heart of sea notes that only seems to worsen the synthetic vibe of this fragrance. I'm rarely negative but this is absolutely a scrubber in my humble opinion. Sure, it's unique and original for a male scent in that the litchi normally reserved for feminine scents take prominence here, but this is not quality organic juice by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, judging from my experience; it's a repellant and caused many a negative reaction when I tested it at work, the gym and at home.  Sure longevity is quite good at around 6-10 hours and sillage extremely strong the first 3-4 hours of wear before settling down to a moderate level of projection, but very few men want to smell like this.

This is like Georgio Beverley Hills Wings Homme or Jacques Bogart Silver Scent and very synthetic 1.5 hours - 3.5 hours. 7 inch projection. Softening a little, thank goodness. I get flickers of what it is what trying to do - it is trying to be sexy and I think it falls short. 3.5 hours - 5 hours - 4 inch projection. Its getting more diluted, more alluring, less harsh, the best bit. Much more like a freshie scent and very nice and alluring. Worth the wait, yes I think so 5 hours - 7 hours. 3 inch projection, but subtle. It trails more than projects 7- 9 hours. Close to skin The bottle lid which flips sideways is really cheap and plasticy, so I recommend those who like bottles should stay away This is 85% the same as Dunhill Red but Blue is like a more aqua/diluted version of Red and more modern and fresher This is not really a fresh summer chilled frag- the start is far from it and it is harsh and bitter, though at the end gets really quite nice and alluring and watery- is it worth the wait? Try it and see? After a couple of hours it is very fresh and alluring', ""I am surprised I like this as much as I do. First, it is not an aquatic fragrance. There is an aquatic note in this, but it's not at all dominant, and it's really well blended so as to give lightness and lift to the sweet soapiness of the fragrance. Desire Blue is a true flanker of Desire For Men. They are VERY similar in that they both have a sweet, floral soapiness that dominates and defines both fragrances. Blue is drier, not quite as sweet, and a lot greener smelling than Desire For Men. It reminds me a lot of Greenbriar by Caswell-Massey, or even a cross between Cool Water and Irish Spring Soap. This isn't really my style because it's sweeter than what I usually like to wear, and it's not very unique, but its cheerful, uplifting smell is hard to resist. MY RATING: 7.5/10"", 'This is initially quite subtle smelling but projects well. It is fresh and slightly sweet but with green notes as well. Balances fresh and green and masculine. It feels aquatic rather than heavy and gets slightly soapy and deeper late on. There is a definite vanilla vibe to me, despite no vanilla in the listed notes. Based on 2 sprays it is subtle but for 3 or 4 hours it projects very well. By 6 hours it is close to the skin. By 8 hours it is fading and going. With 4 sprays it seems to last almost twice as long.

Finally the rosewood comes to play its part, which is not being a strong one, it's light and more youthful form in Desire Blue.

I expected an aromatic aquatic and this is classified as an aromatic green and now I see why. I loved Desire for a Man and expected this to be a watery weak scent and it is nothing of the sort... This is crafted in the classic style of three scent 'chords' composed of four 'notes' each. I find scents made in this fashion very well-balanced and usually harmonise well on my skin. This begins with the zesty citrus of mandarin and bergamot but has the subtle sweet juiciness of lychee and the soft floralcy of aquatic lotus flower...heavenly! The citrusy water vibe continues in the heart, accented by rosewood (yum) and mahogany, is very crisp and unique. This projects very well for a 'blue' scent. The drydown is smooth and sexy with sweet tonka and warm, smooth benzoin balancing amber's richness and a very clean musk. All through a wearing of this you are delighted by different nuances between the notes and accords present. When I wore it last a few days ago I did a lot of fast walking in mid-70 degree temperatures and full sun and my body heat seemed to magnify and project the scent without getting a sweatiness or sourness to it, as some citrus heavy scents can.

Right from the start it\'s a classic soapy-fresh kind of grassy fougere with a subtle resinous quality in the base. A little sour, sharp, and acqueous. The soft pastel green of the bottle matches the scent profile well. Further on the balance gets a little denser, warmer, and just a tad musky like freshly laundered clothes. Again the emphasis is towards soaps, clean linens, and white musks within a watery-fresh structure. The dewy grass impression is nice in the first half hour or so, but it\'s not necessarily photorealistic or anything super interesting.

Daytime"", ""One of the best value cheapies I've picked up, and perfect for spring. Calvin Klein Truth is a dewy, green, grassy, freshie without being utterly generic, synthetic, or relying on the familiar designer tropes. Although it does open with a familiar early 2000s type of feel, this dissipates and smooths out to feel like a pleasant fresh breeze carrying some sunny spring warmth.  Truth runs adjacent to Costume National Cyber Garden, as they both feel like they are touching on the same concept of capturing spring in a bottle, but with some digitized/synthetic aspects that work well with the more natural smelling aspects in both. Side by side they don't really smell that similar, but they are in the same wheelhouse.  Truth definitely runs somewhat counter to the listed notes. I do get some light fruitiness not listed (without cloying sweetness) that mixes with the green notes nicely. No deep resins or heavy patchouli to be found to my nose. The woody-ish base is gentle and provides some nice balance to the sharper open and mid.  @talkaboutscents sums up the technical side and analyzes of Truth very well, and much better than I, so definitely check out their review.  This does not smell super unique, or niche, or like it is going to be a revelation. Just a pleasant, light experience that provides some nice contrast in my collection of smoky, woody, incensed, heavier scents. I could see Truth smelling generic to more seasoned noses, but to me it just smells nice and easy, like Sunday morning on a warm spring day."", ""Picked up a bottle of this for just over a tenner, and it is awesome.

I wanted a spring/summer scent and saw that it scored over 4 on the reviews and purchased it because it was on special for $29 (Australian) for 100ml. Yes, I‚Äôm a cheapskate. Haha. Anyway, this scent is much better than I anticipated. Very classy and perfect for warm weather. Nice to have a summer scent not dominated by citrus notes. This has a fresh woody smell and green leaf smell. Dry down smells like fresh sawdust with the basil and cardamom in the background which is very pleasant to my nose. Definitely a winning scent for daytime and outdoors. This would be great at an outdoor table at a cafe and is probably ok for work as well. It is not a powerful scent and won‚Äôt last all day.

Thumbs up for sure!', 'Men perfumes always gave me impression of being suitable especially for summertime, probably because of their freshness and lack of overly sweetness. This one is for sure one of them.  The basil and the cardamom together brought me to the blue sea, as feeling the nice breeze on my skin while sitting on a boat. Meanwhile, fern and resins as the middle notes took me in the green deep forest with the light shinning on my face through the shimmering leaves.  The base scents of cedar, which I know pretty well since I often pick it\'s leaves from the tree and smell it while walking in the forest, together with patchouli and wood, embraces the whole mixture and wakes my senses up in such a way that, I couldn\'t avoid to think I truly ""truthly"" enjoy it.  Sometimes as woman I like to wear a man perfume too when I\'m in some proper mood.', ""Was going to leave a nice long review but can't touch @talkaboutscents  Agree on all accounts. I initially came across it in my search for a nice outdoorsy, petrichor, woody scent. I tried the Encre Noire's and few other vetivers but weren't for me. I reeally like the heavy ozone with Xyrena's Neon Sunset but finding the sweet florals of it tend to lean more feminine.  With CK Truth, I get the freshly cut green grass/ basil up front and then sandalwood on the drydown. Wish it would last longer; maybe get 2 or so hours before needing to reapply. Usually do about 7-8 sprays on pulse points and chest. I'll get the random whiffs of the sandalwood for a few hours after the green opening settles down. But where it really shines in the drydown is high heat weather. That's when I get more of the nice sandalwood.  Would also enjoy another flanker that includes heavy ozone like Neon Sunset or the complete petrichor scent like Narciso Rodriguez for Him (replace the sandalwood drydown with violet for the ozone and much more patchouli for earthy tones). Would be really awesome to have the fresh cut wet grass in the opening and then petrichor/ ozone/ earthy/ wet concrete on the drydown. If anyone reading this knows of another scent that emulates something like this let me know! But for now it's in my heavy rotation for spring and summer; perfect for going to a backyard BBQ!"", '@talkaboutscents ... best ""heart-to-heart talk/review"" ... honest review! üòå', 'Some reviewers said it rightfully so - this is without a doubt the definition of underrated. Most of you might relate, and those who can\'t relate, perhaps will relate in the future when they are at that stage after smelling/using hundreds, if not thousands of fragrances only to reach to the realization that some of these underrated, now-cheapies from yesteryear are actually, amazing blends. Calvin Klein - Truth is straight up there at the top category in my opinion when it comes to the decade of 00.  It is strikingly similar to Comme des Garcons - Odeur 71, which came 2 years earlier than Truth, and is considered an art piece by many but I think many fall into the illusion of CdG‚Äôs genius marketing and descriptions. You won‚Äôt see people losing their minds under Truth reviews :) Now let\'s look at the announced (marketing) notes. I can see how it doesn\'t always resonate with some people. Resins? Patchouli? Exotic woods? Huh? The only notes that really makes sense and can be noticed are the green/grassy accord (not a single note), basil (with anisic-sweet fresh herbal at the top), cardamom (giving fresh spicy kick but hardly noticeable on its own, likely because it is carved into the blend itself and its effect can only be understood if we had the chance to smell the formula without). My notes interpretation from what I could catch within my experience of perfume ingredients (and some information from the books I read) would be: Basil - Pineapple - Pear Green grass, leaves - Cardamom - Galbanum  Sandalwood - Cedarwood - Calone (Aquatic notes) Green/Grassy top accord: Triplal (common green leafy aldehyde), Galbanum EO with its sharp green balsamic mastic gum nuances) Fruity-green top accord: Dynascone (common pineapple-galbanum ingredient, also key top-heart in Aventus) and touch of lemon/bergamot (limonene, citral, linalool). There is also a violet (ionones) note with a pineapple-pear-green ingredient to give a nice shade of fruity pear effect. This is where the connections made by most people to Dior - Higher, and it is accurate. Spicy-top-heart: Sweet basil oil (anisic, fresh herbal), cardamom seed oil (spicy citrusy and terpenic fresh) - these create an amazing accord in combination with the green and fruity top. Musky-woody base: There\'s Calone (watermelon aquatic watery), white musks, likely Iso E Super and some amber nuanced Cedramber (this combo could be what they market as red cedar) and maybe in combination with cedar virgina oil, and there\'s definitely sandalwood (what they market as exotic woods) which is Javanol (one of the finest sandalwood synthetics). For me, Truth\'s charm comes from this hidden sandalwood note that wraps the entire fruity watery greenery like a blanket. And the more you learn about perfumery, these so-called ""cheapies"" that are brutally disregarded (most likely because people see them as outdated or the brand/marketing is not appealing to snob-perfumeheads) shine in a different light. Always remember that perfumery sales is driven mostly based on marketing and not based on ingredients (even though marketing likes to lie about ""finest ingredients, highest quality ingredients"" etc). There is no finest, rarest, highest quality ingredients in mass production. There is only one thing, economical production. I was never one to use a perfume for its hype or status, but purely by its scent and the feeling it gave me. Lanvin Oxygene, Issey Miyake - Bleu d\'Issey, Carolina Herrera - 212 Men, Dior - Higher, Tommy by Tommy Hilfiger, Givenchy - Blue Label, Armani Lui/He and many more...These are amazing value for price today, and CK - Truth stands right there with them. So use this and others that ""you"" like regardless of what the impression is in full confidence knowing you are not spraying something much inferior to, say, one of those expensive Maison Francis Kurkdjian\'s Aqua Celestia, Forte, Masculin etc...', ""Respectable creation.

If everyone is right that this is CK‚Äôs best and/or most underrated men‚Äôs fragrance this may become my favorite cheapie this spring. Will update when I receive it. Update: I really like it, it opens almost like a green aquatic. It has that ozonic vibe overused in blue aquatics but here paired nicely with fougere greens. Then with a touch of resinous woods and dash of sweetness that come to the forefront in the dry down. Smells great throughout. It‚Äôs hard not to like, with the formulaic 90s designer cologne vibe, but unique enough that it makes a very nice option for spring and summer. The richer dry down makes it stand out for a cheapie. In some ways it‚Äôs almost like they took some nice facets from a bunch of different popular 90s department store scents and distilled them here, the Polos, the Tommy‚Äòs, the CKs, etc. etc. Really a no-brainer at 23 bucks. Though I have to agree with many reviews that the atomizer/sprayer on this is absolutely the worst I‚Äôve ever seen. It‚Äôs a big rectangle of plastic that feels loose and wobbly and ridiculously cheap. and then when you push it a pretty small amount of mist weakly sprays out.', ""Had this and sold it a while back, which I kind of regret now! I may buy again as I think it would be a great warmer spring day scent. It's fresh and uplifting, watery green and modern (not modern as in ambrox etc), ie not dated smelling.

I love that its a summer fragrance without citrus or an extreme marine vibe, I think that is especially hard to do.', 'I still have my original bottle from 2002. I remember buying this for full department store price for over a 100$ bucks, this was long before online fragrance discounters were around. I was getting low and decided to re-up for a new bottle. They are almost identical, the only difference being that my 2020 bottle seems to not last as long. I looked on here just to be sure I haven‚Äôt already left a review, and I‚Äôm a bit surprised I didn‚Äôt leave one. There‚Äôs absolutely nothing negative to say about this stuff. It‚Äôs a green freshie that is so aromatically pleasing that it should deserve all of the praise it gets really. For my nose it‚Äôs tough to explain what this smells like really. The basil an cardamom combo in the opening works quite well. This has the typical CK trademark of colognes too, it‚Äôs so exceptional to smell and wear that you feel like a million bucks while wearing it. My original 2002 bottle I could easily get anywhere from 7-8 hours upon spraying, it felt like it stuck to your skin, but sadly with my 2020 bottle, I can seem to only get 3-4 hours. However, given that I only paid about 30$ bucks for a 100ml bottle, I‚Äôm more than happy because it still also smells the same. Normally when wearing a cologne usually one area does better than the other, sometimes it‚Äôs the opening that shines, and sometimes it‚Äôs the drydown that shines. To me, this one does extremely well in all areas, the opening, mid, and drydown. It‚Äôs got a fresh clean laundry type of vibe too. To my nose it has that sweet spicy commercial type of vibe that you get from other popular designers, but it‚Äôs not obnoxious either. This is a personal favourite of my mine from the CK house, and I remember finding out about it through those cologne peel and sniff adverts from early 2000 magazines. It‚Äôs an extremely underrated cologne and if you find it, don‚Äôt hesitate in getting it. To me this is quite original in nature too. Solid 9/10 from me.', ""For me this is a really nice scent.

I really wish I had tried this one sooner. The performance is also good with solid projection. I give this a 95/100."", 'I had a bottle of this kicking around unopened for about 15 years. After experiencing 2020, I figured, how bad can this be, and decided to open it. Contrary to what people here are saying, this stuff lasts a long time. True, half of it disappears in a few hours, but what remains lasts and lasts in fleeting puffs. A three spritz application from the day before woke me out of a deep sleep the next morning! (Half asleep, I was sure someone was in my shower and purposely poured out a full bottle of shampoo.) It is a green scent for sure, but I‚Äôve never smelled anything in nature that exactly resembles this. It is kind of a perfumy synthetic fresh cut grass smell. Almost as if the mower traversing the lawn also sliced a few unseen cans of Axe Deodorant open in the cutting process. Not offensive, and not all that bad. I‚Äôm not sure the significance of the tilted bottle. Is it that the Truth can easily be bent?... and for anyone anal enough that wants to keep the chrome top beautiful and pristine, it needs a wipe each time due to the oily blow back from spritzing.

Nor is Truth citrusy despite the long list of citrusy molecules in the concoction. Has some of the ozone of Lanvin Oxygene. Very deftly blended. And except for the aquatic note, fairly unique. A chemist could tell you the exact aquatic molecule you have in numerous fragrances, but I can't name it. The nose Almairac has created iconic, fabulous fragrances. Take a moment to click on his name and be surprised and impressed! Truth is a bargain - 20 bucks gets you a big heavy bottle of an artful fragrance nobody wears nowadays."", ""Finally I got myself a bottle of this, a blind buy, it had been on my radar for years!  Well, my first impressions are good. I honestly wasn't expecting too much given that this doesn't really get hyped a lot. I wasn't expecting a strong fragrance, which it isn't, but I was expecting a fresh, make that VERY fresh & uplifting fragrance which it most definitely is. This somehow reminds me a little of Clinique's Happy for men, or rather how that would smell if you replaced the citrus for green notes! Both share a similar bright, uplifting vibe. I may be wrong but another fragrance I recall having some similarities was I think 'Higher' by Dior. Anyway, I like this, it's seemingly a simple, easy-going light scent, great as an alternative to citrus scents on a hot day! In a way it's kind of unique yet familiar at the same time. I also don't think it smells dated at all. Try it before it disappears for good as it's been discontinued for a while now. Edit: one of the most ropey sprayers I've yet to come across, fine for the price I paid (around 20$) but not for retail prices back when Truth for Men was new lol !"", ""This is a simple (but not simplistic) fragrance. Damp, green, herbal, a little bit spicy. I don't really get any base notes at all. This could be the ideal choice for the introvert, someone who wears fragrance solely for themselves and doesn't care about making a statement. If you HATE Dior's Sauvage you might LOVE this!  Truth for women has the same damp dewy character. Many male/female companion fragrances actually smell little alike (Obsession for instance) but Truth is essentially the same fragrance with more florals for the women and some spice and (to my nose) a very faint ozonic effect in the opening of the men's version. On me the women's version has greater sillage and longevity.  They don't occupy the extreme ends of masculine and feminine; instead they both linger in the centre of the gender spectrum. Like brogues, trench coats and crisp white button-down shirts."", 'Awesome fragrance .....one of my most favorite fragrance', 'This was my go-to in my youth. One of my earliest designer frags after Acqua di gio, Polo Sport and Van Gils Between Sheets. All these are good scents to me and 90‚Äôs nostalgia. Truth smells like a beautiful sunny spring morning in the forrest after a rainy night. The sour citrus is great, not dissimilar to Acqua di gio. I love it obviously. (Not a hint of modern sweetness that frankly is sickening how they have taken over all male designer scents post 2015.) Not the best longevity, but brilliant scent wise.', ""I really wanted to like this as I am enchanted by the idea of mixing green notes and resinous notes. However, the cardamom note to me doesn't mesh well and the resulting mix is not very distinctive. There is a sourness to it that I really didn't expect either, so I really don't enjoy this one."", ""When I had it, I splashed myself in this super fresh frag. I swear I thought I smelled some fresh bamboo, or bamboo leaves, or raindrops on bamboo... That's very green and refreshing. This is not the citrusy or airy type of fresh. Not like Dior Homme Cologne which is super fresh and invigorating. But this is wet kind of fresh. Like walking into cool rain in bamboo forest type of fresh. Like getting splashed with Gatorade in your face as you're reaching the finish line of your marathon. It smells sour fresh, not sweet, not powdery. Super light. Too bad no staying power whatsoever. Although it's expected from CK and especially with these kind of notes."", 'Delicious! So perfect for hot summer and spring days. It opens so fresh and zesty, there‚Äôs a strong herby note at first, and then it calms down to a really smooth and fresh aquatic type scent. As another reviewer had said, there‚Äôs no strong note here, it seems to be a few different notes blended exquisitely to create something truly unique. Calvin Klein fragrances aren‚Äôt overly expensive, this was only about $50 for 100mls, but I‚Äôm finding that mostly they‚Äôre pretty decent quality for the price. The longevity on this is average, as you‚Äôd expect, but I find that the projection is above average, I‚Äôm certainly leaving a trail after this. It‚Äôs a winner if you ask me. When it‚Äôs super hot and you need something to cool you down and get you smelling perfectly gorgeous, I certainly recommend reaching for this. The only downside is the hideous shaped bottle.', ""Very nice scent! It starts out a bit 'manly' but gradually softens over time. Very good longevity, I can still smell it after 6+ hours.  To me, there are no discernible notes, it is more of a blend - that's not a bad thing!"", 'This has been in my rotation since it launched. Countless others have come and gone. I really enjoy this scent, it\'s the crispest herbal aroma ever, this is what I imagine when I think of the ""fougere"" accord. The opening is so refreshing, sweet basil, tarragon,cardamom, thyme and coriander. There\'s a powerful ozonic effect that ""smells"" like rain. A super clean patchouli develops along with a cyclamen type of accord, and a tomato leaf, adding depth to the mid and base and adding structure to those bright spice/herbal notes. It\'s almost like a small kitchen garden on a moist morning, absolutely wonderful. It\'s very linear, the drydown leaning a bit more woody/spicy as the top notes fade away. Very well balanced and cohesive. This is slept on, in my humble opinion one of the best.', 'Husband\'s review: ""it\'s alright."" As you can tell, he\'s a wordsmith when it comes to perfumes :) On him I barely smell it, but on me it lasts quite a while. The first blast is wonderful - a typical fresh, watery, and aromatic fragrance with basil as the centerpiece. I\'m getting an agua fresca with basil and rosemary. As it dries, a sweet ozonic green note and with a cedary base comes forward. This reminds me of a aromatic version of Terranova Rain--in fact I layered these two together and now its softer and more suitable for a woman. Later, I layered Truth for Women over top. All layering experiments came out very refreshing, especially in this 100F weather we\'re having in California.', 'The notes list surprises me because I smell a lot of a Cactus or Aloe Vera like smell in the opening, it has a also a kind of ""hairgel"" vibe to it but in a good way. It\'s also ""wet"", i don\'t know which notes cause that rainy or wet effect. Smells clean, fresh, natural and a bit tropical but in an original way, like walking in a lush and green landscape. Perfect for spring, summer and early fall. I absolutely love the opening/first hour of this cologne but the drydown gets a bit flat. The notes i get the most are: Green leaves, Cardamom and Fern, i\'d add Cactus and Aloe Vera to this list because it sounds obvious to me. It\'s fresh but not an aquatic fragrance, green but not bitter, uplifting but not citrusy, tropical but not sweet. It reminds me a bit of a non-gourmand fresher version of Reveal. It\'s the kind of scent you could catch a whiff of and think this is the natural scent from somebody.', 'Sold my bottle was too weak as shown in the votes above.', ""I absolutely love this fragrance.  My experiences with Calvin Klein's Truth began when I purchased a 100 mL bottle of it for just ‚Ç¨25 at TKMaxx earlier last year. I had always liked Calvin Klein fragrances, and this one turned out to be no different. The overall appeal of the fragrance is certainly very green. Like the fresh morning dew on cold grass, the top notes cut through the air like a sharp sickle being thrown at winter grass. This cold, bright green accord struck me the moment I sprayed some of the scent from the angular, edgy bottle.  Truth then skillfully intertwines notes of silky woods with the green accords to reveal a satisfying, modern middle. It's probably not one of the most unique fragrances I've ever tried, but is definitely one of the most pleasant ones. With its soft, cardamom-patchouli accord, Truth is very, very easy to wear - day or night.  Remaining fairly linear throughout its presence, Truth concludes with a soft trail of cedary woods and powdery, musky patchouli. This drydown is soothing and lasts a long time, despite remaining relatively close to the skin.  Whenever I'm in the mood for something uncomplicated, Truth is the bottle I always reach for. The fragrances exudes character and class; it's safe, and yet, exuberant. The bottle is a great representation of the vivid juice it houses.  I speak only of the Truth. (Had to be done ;))"", 'Till now the ugliest and worst fragrance i had ever smelled.', ""Y'all don't know anything and your noses don't work. This smells 90% like Gucci guilty Black. Aromatic fougere and predominantly green. Nice for spring and for hot days. I don't know what y'all talking about sillage or maybe you got something old but 1-2 sprays were more than enough for me to last quite a 8-10 hours. On the whole a very nice and fresh fragrance. Would give it 7/10"", ""It would easily be in my top 10 of summer fragrances if it had better longevity. I have a huge collection so that's saying something. It has such a wonderful summery vibe with its green/grassy, clean notes. The Basil in this screams summer without smelling like a garden salad like some other fragrances with basil or similar green notes.  If you have a large fragrance collection in this genre you may find Truth For Men to be redundant. Otherwise, it's worth the current $15-$20 price tag. However, I suggest you take along a decant because this barely lasts 1-2 hours. Pity for a fragrance with such a beautiful summer composition.  Ssshhh the Truth is..... its weak."", 'Just got this one yesterday. Awesome ""after rain"" scent but unfortunately performance and longetivity are horrible :/', ""i blind bought this from marshall's because the reviews here told me it was grassy; i like grassy. i sprayed it on in the parking lot and regretted my impulsive nature. it smelled green-ish but not grassy per se. it smelled very generic in that it didn't smell like anything specific, it reminded me of other things i recognized but couldn't identify by name. now, several hours into the drydown, i'm getting an intense basil, which is supposed to be up in the top notes according to the note breakdown. it's like,how much more basil could this be? the answer is, none, none more basil.  simple, beautiful, classic. every movie in every cinema is about basil. basil sells."", ""Summer lime and mint perfume it's really just a bit sweet. But longevity is really poor too bad"", 'To cut this short, this smells exactly like a wet field of grass during the rain. It\'s quite evocative of that scent and really fantastic. CK Truth for Women also smells like that, but more like a lush meadow with some flowers as well. I\'ve been looking for a cologne to encapsulate the smell of rain and wet grass (""petrichor"") for a long time, and I have to say this is the greatest example of that in my experience. If I\'m looking for individual notes though, I basically smell grass, leaves, a watery accord, cardamom, and basil. Since it\'s very atmospheric, it doesn\'t lean masculine or feminine but CK Truth for Women is definitely in the feminine direction. As a perfume, it\'s probably my favourite from the CK line as it isn\'t sweet at all (like CK Eternity is), isn\'t as bitter as CK Euphoria, and isn\'t as fleeting as other CK colognes. It smells like the word ""melancholy"", but is very pleasant and inoffensive. Sillage is however only moderate but leaning light (as is the case with most CK perfumes) while longevity is also moderate. The bottle for this is very interesting, but the sprayer is really bad. However, I can overlook these issues because it provides a fantastic sensory experience if you want to smell like a wet field of grass during a rainshower. 4.5/5', 'Calvin Klein truth is a very under-rated gem from the house of Calvin Klein and I‚Äôm very surprised this isn‚Äôt more popular because it‚Äôs very mass pleasing and has gotten me some compliments from time to time ! Truth opens up with a very bright,Dewey,slightly juicy but fresh green note that to my nose is 1 of those fresh cut grass smells similar to Carolina Herrera 212 men but this is more aromatic and less musky. Truth is pretty linear but once it dries down the patchouli and sandalwood kick in making this slightly sweeter but also more earthy. To describe this scent as a whole id say this is very green,natural smelling and this reminds me of the smell of fresh cut grass after a nice rain. For those familiar with the Bath n Body works lotion ‚ÄúRainkissed leaves‚Äù, this smells very similar to that ! Performance‚Äî some people are saying this doesn‚Äôt last but on my skin I get 5-8 hours with above average projection. This scent is perfect for spring/summer use and would be a great scent for the office as it‚Äôs very inoffensive if you only use 2-4 sprays. Overall rating‚Äî 8 out of 10 ! A personal favorite of mine that I‚Äôm positive if this was released by Hermes that this would be a hit ! A perfect Spring scent Sidenote: This is a less is more fragrance ! 3-4 sprays mad if your indoors and 4-6 max if your outdoors. You may think because this is a light scent that it won‚Äôt be cloying but if over applied it can be headache inducing. BUT if done right it‚Äôs the perfect scent for the office that may get you noticed but will still be inoffensive for even sensitive noses', 'When looking at it‚Äôs accords, I wouldn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like it. I always look for the smells that have aquatic citrus and woody notes, BUT THIS , THIS IS MY FAVORITE SMELL EVER EVER EVER EVER!! To me it smells like an aqua kind of smell! Its my favorite PERIOD! And it‚Äôs cheap as sin', 'I\'d forgotten about this one off and on over the years, as it was one I wore most often when it first came out. It was one of my first selective purchases. I\'d started in high school with Old Spice, graduated to Cool Water and Drakkar Noir, landed on CK Eternity and Obsession when I was a little older, and wore most of the 90\'s culture at some point. These were buys made on TV commercials, sexy ads and clever ads. Some I liked, some were just culture in my area. Truth was the first one where I went to buy the standard Obsession et al, and met a lady working the counter of a department store and she had me sample a few other things. Truth stood out as a less sweet, more refined smell than CK\'s other offerings. It was less spicy than, um, Old Spice and so different than Drakkar and Brut and Polo, the other things I\'d grown up with in the early 90\'s. I bought it cuz I liked it, and wasn\'t there for it specifically, I selected it. It was magical then, it was mine. It didn\'t last long, it faded to a skin scent fairly quickly. This is where I learned the power of subtle scents. I went through a series of years wearing this where I would be confident to get a girl close knowing I\'d ultimately hear ""mmmm you smell so good"". I think this may be the most complimented scent I\'ve ever worn, but sat so close to the skin only those I was very physically close with could smell it. But it worked, every time, I can\'t think of a time it didn\'t. And it really drew them in and I was nuzzled and sniffed and close many a time, and there\'s probably a lesson in there somewhere. Years passed, Axe body sprays hit the market, things changed, I stopped using the stuff. I have a very old bottle still in my cabinet. About 4 years ago I wore some on a date. Sure enough on a tram ride across town we had to squeeze in tight. She got close and was drawn in, ""mmmm you smell good"", and commence the nuzzling. Still I don\'t wear it and the same bottle was opened a few weeks back, on a date (I don\'t date often, despite the story) and ""mmmm you smell good"". I\'ve only been revisiting scents for about a year now. I like projection, staying power, moderate sillage, and have yet to find a genre I love. Projection and sillage are not Truth\'s truth. And yet, from a ""mmmm"" and nuzzling perspective, this has been my most credited scent. Would it be more effective if it was a power house? I\'d say probably not. It\'ll linger real close after an hour, a good dab behind each ear on the pulse. Even my old bottle. A long review, but this has been an on again, off again thing with Truth for a decade and a half for me. It has served a singular successful purpose for me every time, so it deserves some words. Should someone be in the market for a scent that no one knows you\'re wearing until you are close, and you want to be closer, this may be your Truth.', ""Hallelujah! I went thru many irritating cologne blind buys to get to this. I found it at Burlington for $25 for the 3.4oz. OMG so clean and fresh! no headache-y citrus fruit or irritating heady smells; just this can't offend! I feel confident and clean and dare I say this but this has the refreshing notes from Dior Higher's opening note or a Tommy Hilfiger cologne but without all the woods (Dior Higher) or heady fruits (Tommy). The fragrance has a cool minty green soft clean spicy vibe. And it don't smell like Lacoste essential as another viewer saidLacoste is a beautiful Florida Everglades green with a touch of Chrome Azzaro. This is almost mint green a touch of moss and soft clean patchouli"", 'Fresh. Like a cheap and less iconic version of ADG. I wear it in my gymbag.', ""This was a gift for hubs. He seems to like this one more than CK Eternity, which he specifically asked for. I prefer it too.  This is a lovely fresh herbal scent that is quite refreshing in the heat.

At first I thought it was a little weak and one dimensional, then 3 hours later it really seemed to find its teeth. This scent (for me anyway) starts out quiet and gets stronger as the day goes on.  Longevity for me was good, especially for a CK fragrance.  Very green (almost to the point of being over the top) but a great scent IMHO, quite different to other scents from this house. Just be aware that the user can get noise-blind to it so don't over apply.

Nice :)"", 'Truth for Men by Calvin Klein is a herbal (or green) and fresh fragrance. This fragrance gives a feeling of being in a garden pruned or watered recently, it is very nice, very fresh.

I can not find many changes in its development, it is very similar from start to finish, but at the end its feels more woodsy. Its projection is moderate to low, however unlike many other opinions about their longevity on my laster about 12 hrs. although close to the skin.

A woman's perspective is this is an attention getter! I was very surprised by how much depth the cardamom adds. On him, basil, sandalwood, cardamom come in together. Then, the patchouli and juniper. Pepper is very subtle, adding an edge- which is good, because there is a sweetness to this fragrance. Make no mistake, guys- it's fully loaded with testosterone! Contrary to some reviews, I would actually consider it to be almost a sillage monster. So don't think because you can no longer smell it that we can't. Truth definitely has attitude... Best fitting a man who is sophisticated, but also knows how to chop wood.

Bought It for my boyfriend for Christmas too! The smell is so addictive, really unique, nothing quite like it really. I'd never get bored of it, and it seems to last so much longer than any aftershave/perfume I've ever come across. I once knew someone who wore this scent all the time and I thought it was purely his own scent that smelt so amazing...until I recognised the smell at the duty free shops in the airport. I have had a few people comment that it seems quite unisex, so maybe its not the typical musky masculine scent that some may be after, but it drives me wild!"", 'i hav noted that this perfume has always got mixed reviews, but tis is for those who like green and fresh fragrance, my experience with around 3 truth bottles is that its very aromatic and green but fresh so i hav always got tons of compliments , the longevity is extra ordinary, the projection is awesome, and after 3 hours in sun it turns a little woody but with a fresh and green hint .', 'No doubt this is an aromatic fougere.

Using patchouli in the top AND base, I like that, Patchouli is fantastic. This green, pure scent turns out more aquatic than anything. Priceline have all Calvin Kleins for $40. I might have to go for that :-) Perfect casual scent', ""I like this one. Patchouli is not heavy at all, and it comes on after it's been worn and exhausted all day. It's fresh (not refreshing), light, sweet, and green aquatic'ish. It's very wearable by anyone, and the bottle is cool and collectible! Somehow, the scent reminds me of Hugo Element or the CK Eternity Summer line. It's a great one to have and I am still looking for one at a good price."", ""You are right: fresh, green, wet, and grassy. I immediately liked on first aplication, and then all went down hill. By no means it is bad. It's really fresh and likeable.

Because it is so likable, I will not hesitate to place this fragrance into a unisex category. This fragrance opens with clean and crisp 'metallic greens', with a subtle hint of pepper. The scent is rather fresh, although not overly Summery or too watery, it has substance. Surprisingly this fragrance strikes me as being very natural, like the scent of grass on the floor of a forest and a man that has showered with spicy soap. Truth for Men is almost luscious and smooth. It's not what I'd call particularly sexy, however on a man, it's very approachable. Through discovering this fragrance, I've realised that green scents work way better on men. Those grassy and earthy notes could suit practically any man, despite his personality, style or age. The lasting strength of Truth for Men is great, as is the sillage, although not powerful, has a great projection. In my opinion this is the perfect choice for a man seeking a naturalistic, clean fragrance at a reasonable price."", 'great for summer nice very clean .i feel good all the day,attracting fragrance,smells so very natural', ""'Tell the truth, but always with a slant'...hence the shape of the bottle and the idea behind the scent. According to cK's website this is still available in the US and the notes above are not what is in MY bottle. I(and anyone who has worn and enjoyed this fresh green wonder) can tell you that these are more like it: TOP: bamboo,watery greens,tea leaves HEART: basil,cardamom,green jasmine BASE: sun musk,white patchouli,cedar... and wacapou(Indian for pine) (These are right from CK website) TfM begins with an aqueous suspension of lush and green foliage, smooth, fresh and luminous. The initial accord fades but surrounds what follows with a verdant shimmer until the end. The aromatic basil (I love basil) is softened by cardamom's smooth warmth and these two notes blend in with the sexy clear jasmine like lovers in a menage a trois, innocent, curious and sensual all at once. The musk here truly smells as if the sun is shining on everything in this scent, and the patchouli (if any) is quite clean and lite. The cedar is there but in more of a background way and never overpowers our 'green lovers'. The wacapou (that took a while to find and define) is the green of the still living needles and not the wood or the pungent sap-smell of Christmas trees. If you are looking for something truly, naturally green (but not overly herbal) and watery(but not aquatic or caloney) this is the one for you.Despite the surprising lack of citruses Givaudan has captured 'fresh and succulent' rather well.  Simple and beautiful, like Truth itself, but with a slight twist, as if the truth is told but something has been held back to protect the feelings or innocence of someone you truly care about... Sillage: good Longevity: could be better Overall: 4.75/5 This is a true wonder of modern perfumery in that it smells so very natural and pure but is composed of mostly synthetic components. This is the perfect synthesis of natural essences and man-made materials. The life of the scent is short-lived but as with all things in Nature, nothing lasts forever..."", 'A very pleasant surprise at first!  A fresh and vivid green watery-citrused sparkle when out of the bottle, but it lacks more solid base notes to convey the scent deeper and longer (like vetiver, sandalwood or cedar) and what remains on the skin after moderate spray is a slight grassy-lime scent.  I miss pepper in the heart notes to give more body to this very good scent. I liked Dune by Dior better, which was tried on the same day. It had the same vegetal opening with much more consistency and longetivity.', 'Another classic from cK. Very green with subtle woody notes, and a little sour. But this sourness is not citric type, u know some plants have sour green leaves, so this is that kind of sourness. It always gets me felt so fresh and cool. Perfect summer scent.

I should have liked this.....why didn't I?"", ""One of the greenest, fruitiest things out there. I really like Truth, but to me it suffers in a way that almost all Calvin Klein frags do - it's just too weak and doesn't last very long. What is it with CK being so topical in dimension?

Good for work or play."", ""This is a wonderfull all-purpose scent. Always fresh, and it lasts really long.

That\'s true it\'s not a complicated perfume. Simple,fresh,light green grass smell combined with some pepper and mild citrus note.

It start with a very refreshing ""bamboo"" or ""grass cutting"" smell, slowly then transform to a mild, nice green scent with hints of bit sourness, imagine the after rain freshness in the middle of the bamboo rain forest! Amazing journey! It end with a very mild musky aromatic scent with overall lasting power more than 4 hours! It stay closed to skin and projection I would say is okay, a very self-pleased mood lifting scent. I love to wear it to the office and casual dating, great compliments from a lot of my friends.  Truth is an amazing and attracting fragrance, the scent calm my busy day down and relax my mind and nerve giving me state of peace and harmony feeling - a definite magic potion for me!

Most of you might relate, and those who can\'t relate, perhaps will relate in the future when they are at that stage after smelling/using hundreds, if not thousands of fragrances only to reach to the realization that some of these underrated, now-cheapies from yesteryear are actually, amazing blends. Calvin Klein - Truth is straight up there at the top category in my opinion when it comes to the decade of 00.  It is strikingly similar to Comme des Garcons - Odeur 71, which came 2 years earlier than Truth, and is considered an art piece by many but I think many fall into the illusion of CdG‚Äôs genius marketing and descriptions. You won‚Äôt see people losing their minds under Truth reviews :) Now let\'s look at the announced (marketing) notes. I can see how it doesn\'t always resonate with some people. Resins? Patchouli? Exotic woods? Huh? The only notes that really makes sense and can be noticed are the green/grassy accord (not a single note), basil (with anisic-sweet fresh herbal at the top), cardamom (giving fresh spicy kick but hardly noticeable on its own, likely because it is carved into the blend itself and its effect can only be understood if we had the chance to smell the formula without). My notes interpretation from what I could catch within my experience of perfume ingredients (and some information from the books I read) would be: Basil - Pineapple - Pear Green grass, leaves - Cardamom - Galbanum  Sandalwood - Cedarwood - Calone (Aquatic notes) Green/Grassy top accord: Triplal (common green leafy aldehyde), Galbanum EO with its sharp green balsamic mastic gum nuances) Fruity-green top accord: Dynascone (common pineapple-galbanum ingredient, also key top-heart in Aventus) and touch of lemon/bergamot (limonene, citral, linalool). There is also a violet (ionones) note with a pineapple-pear-green ingredient to give a nice shade of fruity pear effect. This is where the connections made by most people to Dior - Higher, and it is accurate. Spicy-top-heart: Sweet basil oil (anisic, fresh herbal), cardamom seed oil (spicy citrusy and terpenic fresh) - these create an amazing accord in combination with the green and fruity top. Musky-woody base: There\'s Calone (watermelon aquatic watery), white musks, likely Iso E Super and some amber nuanced Cedramber (this combo could be what they market as red cedar) and maybe in combination with cedar virgina oil, and there\'s definitely sandalwood (what they market as exotic woods) which is Javanol (one of the finest sandalwood synthetics). For me, Truth\'s charm comes from this hidden sandalwood note that wraps the entire fruity watery greenery like a blanket. And the more you learn about perfumery, these so-called ""cheapies"" that are brutally disregarded (most likely because people see them as outdated or the brand/marketing is not appealing to snob-perfumeheads) shine in a different light. Always remember that perfumery sales is driven mostly based on marketing and not based on ingredients (even though marketing likes to lie about ""finest ingredients, highest quality ingredients"" etc). There is no finest, rarest, highest quality ingredients in mass production. There is only one thing, economical production. I was never one to use a perfume for its hype or status, but purely by its scent and the feeling it gave me. Lanvin Oxygene, Issey Miyake - Bleu d\'Issey, Carolina Herrera - 212 Men, Dior - Higher, Tommy by Tommy Hilfiger, Givenchy - Blue Label, Armani Lui/He and many more...These are amazing value for price today, and CK - Truth stands right there with them. So use this and others that ""you"" like regardless of what the impression is in full confidence knowing you are not spraying something much inferior to, say, one of those expensive Maison Francis Kurkdjian\'s Aqua Celestia, Forte, Masculin etc...', 'Its 8 AM and you are in a garden and the rain just stopped. This is Truth by CK.', 'This scent is the proof for me that great perfurms can also fail in the market.', 'Delicious! So perfect for hot summer and spring days. It opens so fresh and zesty, there‚Äôs a strong herby note at first, and then it calms down to a really smooth and fresh aquatic type scent. As another reviewer had said, there‚Äôs no strong note here, it seems to be a few different notes blended exquisitely to create something truly unique. Calvin Klein fragrances aren‚Äôt overly expensive, this was only about $50 for 100mls, but I‚Äôm finding that mostly they‚Äôre pretty decent quality for the price. The longevity on this is average, as you‚Äôd expect, but I find that the projection is above average, I‚Äôm certainly leaving a trail after this. It‚Äôs a winner if you ask me.

Armani mania is a good compromise of elegance, sexyness, fun and maturity. So it's very versatile, not too mature but never teeny, elegant and casual at the same time.

Armani discontinued Mania because it‚Äôs boring. Now that we have that out of the way, let‚Äôs talk about the fragrance. It is really, really good. A beautiful scent dominated by saffron and woods, with a beautiful musk underlying all of it. It is extraordinarily well done, and I can see why Francis Kurkdjian once said this was among his favourite creations. A welcome departure from the slew sickeningly sweet fragrances, Mania comes across as almost savoury. Where other fragrances would cry out with a nauseating blend of citruses, Mania is content to sit close to the skin with a subdued mandarin, which provides JUST enough brightness and lift to the overall composition to stop you from smelling like a spice rack. It‚Äôs gorgeous, and ties everything together beautifully. But it‚Äôs boring. It‚Äôs linear, the projection and longevity leave a lot to be desired, and it doesn‚Äôt INSPIRE me. It‚Äôs simplistic, linear and relatively weak. To be completely fair to Mania, its simplicity is its greatest strength. If it was padded out with a million notes that only a bloodhound could smell, it‚Äôd take away from the composition at large. Mania was intended to be simple, straightforward and unassuming. And that‚Äôs fine, it does that VERY very well. I have a great deal of respect for fragrances that choose to exercise restraint rather than try to reinvent the wheel.  It‚Äôs as offensive to modern sensibilities as Raisin Bran or dry Weetbix. You won‚Äôt find anyone who hates it, but I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll find anyone that has a nosegasm after smelling it. This is the quintessential ‚Äúyou smell nice‚Äù fragrance. People won‚Äôt make a conscious note of it, but they‚Äôll notice that‚Ä¶ well. You smell nice. And really, what more can anybody ask for? Mania is worth trying if you can find it, but not at the ridiculous asking prices you find today. I‚Äôd cap it off at $100-150 a bottle. There may not be many perfect clones of it out there these days, but remember. This was designed to be a nice, versatile designer fragrance. It wasn‚Äôt artisanal and it didn‚Äôt shake up the industry. There are thousands of other ‚Äúnice, versatile designer fragrances‚Äù out there, many of which I feel are more deserving of their prices than Mania. With that said, if you can find it for a good price, I‚Äôd say go for it. It may not knock your socks off, but I doubt it‚Äôll disappoint, either. It‚Äôs a solid fragrance, and a shame it was discontinued in favour for some of the louder, more screechy Code fragrances.', 'It was great! For me it was the best of Armani!', ""An all-time great.

At the time, there was nothing else like it. Spicy, sweet, woody, mysterious and elegant. Easy to wear, and versatile enough for work, casual or formal occasions. Some of the blue fragrances hit similar marks these days, but nothing I\'ve come across smells like this. Mania was a study in contrasts: Warm and inviting, cool and smooth, somehow light and dark, with a greenish spiciness that drew me (and others) in. One Friday night in 2004, I was on a crowded bus with a bunch of other young professionals headed into the city for a good time. The guy in in front of me was wearing this, as was I, and we turned to each other and smiled and briefly chatted about the recognition. We both said it was the first time we\'d encountered others wearing it, and that we were glad it wasn\'t as common as ADG and Polo Blue, etc. etc. etc. Now I bet we both wish it had been just a little more popular with the masses.

It's obviously not the most daring fragrance Kurkdjian has done but it's refreshing smelling something like this from the early 00's which, even though discontinued, still smells quite modern. Because we're so used to smelling fairly sweet fragrances for men nowadays, this might be a welcome change for someone scoping out some of these older releases.

Mania evokes images of virginal luxury cars, a modern gentleman in a suit an tie, a very new office suite.

Suitable for everything from casual/sporty to formal/elegant, inoffensive, and deliberately crafted with sleek refinement, its wide wheelhouse never causing it to lose its distinction. Perhaps better suited for spring/summer months, an otherwise ""can\'t go wrong here"" scent that, in my opinion, is far superior to the very ubiquitous Armani Code.  (One disclaimer. Due to the dominant fresh-clean accord, as well as its accompanying woody-spicy notes, having this fragrance will likely eliminate the need for certain others.

Let me start by disclaiming that I absolutely adore Mania. It's such an elegant, understated scent. It clicked with me, right from the very first moment I smelled it. However, I'll attempt to be objective - even though I am at heart a completely subjective reviewer. I always try to approach all fragrances with the goal of giving an impression of what the scent is like, but the verdict is always subjective - my personal take on the scent. To give some background, Mania falls in to that woody style that was quite popular in the late 90's and early 2000's. Gucci Rush for men was one of the first that set the template. Versace Man turned it upside down with sweet amber, tobacco and saffron. Gucci Pour Homme I made it dark and austere with incense and a woodsy overload. Mania however, takes the playful route. It opens with a peppery mandarin orange and a boatload of saffron. The saffron is right there from start to finish, and it's beautifully done. It's not the most complex saffron rendition, but it captures the essence of the scent of fresh saffron flowers. The mandarin and saffron notes are joined in the mid by the 2000's mainstay - cedar. It's an obviously synthetic rendition, but it works perfectly here. I also get a hint of smoky vetiver, giving it some depth in the middle. The base is a fairly uneventful musky amber. It's very subdued and is in the background. I get the impression that it's really only there to make sure that the cedar and saffron persist, and it joins those two in a great unison. However, I must approach this fairly. It isn't all rose-y red and spectacular. Mania certainly has it's flaws. 1. It's synthetic. Much like Versace's The Dreamer, they are both created in a hyper-synthetic mold. In The Dreamer it works perfectly, as the scent comes across as being quite futuristic. However in Mania, it seems cheaper. That's not to say that the scent smells cheap, but the ingredient quality is surely lacking a bit. The mandarin and saffron aren't especially distinctive, and I do get the idea that Mania was made to a budget. 2. Mania can come across as too reserved. Compared to Code, Mania is more grown up and understated. But it's almost too understated. I don't want it to cut through the room, but Mania is very close to the skin. Some may like this, I don't mind it, but it'd be interesting to see what Armani could do with a intense version of this. All in all, I consider Mania to be a phenomal scent. The longevity is quite good too - 7-8 hours. Rating: 8.5/10"", 'I am quite unpleasantly surprised about longevity. It is only around 3 max. 4 hours even though I am spraying 3-4times instead of 1-2 as usual. Fragrance itself is lets say enjoyable but I could definitely live without this one and still prefer Code or very similar Burberry rhythm 1 or Allure.', ""This was the first scent I ever bought way back when. It was a blind buy, but I probably couldn't have picked a better scent for myself at the time. Citrus/cedar short opening and then the saffron kicks in, then the woodiness comes in later.  Its kind of perfect for an office more than anything, or general daytime use.  It probably would have been a very popular fragrance, but: it goes to a skin scent very quickly, and it is a bit too synthetic smelling and also alcohol.

No notes scream at you - they all just work in harmony. This is a scent you could take a deep whiff of into infinity and keep doing it without getting sick of it - at the top its ever so slighlty citrusy, slightly woodsy in the middle quickly transitioning to the lightest sweetness and musk at the depths. You cannot go wrong with this. Scent holds well but it is not the best projector. An underrated fragrance suitable for all occasions.', ""Great and under-rated. My favorite for almost a decade. I have never come across anybody else that wears this. Usually Aqua Di-gio is what everyone has even though that doesn't smell bad by any means.  The only bummer for me is (maybe it's because i've had it for so long that I just can't smell it on me for long) that I don't think it lasts very long. I wish they could do something about that. Otherwise it is my all time favorite."", 'The tastiest sent on a man, I dated a guy one time that wore this, and it literally turned me on to smell this sent.

It is a sent for younger men (18-35) its not an ""old man"" smelling cologne.', ""I just got this after getting haunted by the vial that I got like 1 year ago, I finally pull the trigger and not disappointed at all. Smells quite unique to me. When you spray it, the first thing you're going to smell is the alcohol, but just for few seconds, and then it's a wonderful saffron-cedar with a little spice smell, it's just gorgeous. Smells so modern, luxurious, and yet casual and of course masculine. I know this fragrance doesn't project much, but it is actually last quite long on my skin, 6-8 hours, and will sometimes project if you move. I bought it just simply cause it smells just great and unique. This scent will smell even better if they amplified the power. The closest one to Armani Mania is YSL L'homme, it's not that similar, but in a quick sniff(with my amateur nose, haha) it's like they're almost in the same category. YSL L'homme is sweeter and woodier though, and has more power than Mania. So, in conclusion, is this a pass, try or buy? I'll say give this a try, because it smells great and unique, and you still might get a great projection/longevity from this fragrance because everyone's skin reacts differently to one scent.

Armani Mania is a good fragrance. Woody and spice citrus with a floral and sweet twist. Starts with the mandarin and the saffron giving a soapy vibe, but very fancy and different e (sometimes It remmember me Prada man).

It has been a while since last using Armani Mania... What a pleasant surprise..!! Mania is a successful blend of floral, fruity, musk, and woodsy notes that I truly enjoy. It opens with a burst of the floral and fruity notes then settles close to the skin with woodsy notes and musk finish. In my (humble) opinion, Mania breathes ""class"" like a fresh laundered shirt, but offers great flexibility to include wearing with a comfortable pair of jeans and that favorite t-shirt. Additionally, given the fruit and floral notes of the fragrance, the target time(s) of year may be Spring and/or Summer, however, if your body chemistry allows the musk and/or woodsy notes to project, Mania could be worn any time of year or for any occasion. Very well done Mr. Armani..!! Longevity and projection/sillage are moderate, making it ideal for an office setting, but sufficient some 4-6 hours later saying, ""gee, I still smell Armani Mania"". It lasts much longer on clothing. While I haven\'t had favorable comments from the opposite sex, i.e. the ""Wow Factor"", it has the potential. Not sure how many of my female employees feel comfortable saying, ""gee boss, you smell great today..!!"". To reiterate, Armani is a ""class"" scent that has great potential for the ""Wow Factor"". I would like to acknowledge the reviews submitted by Pravda48 and Padme Santal providing credibility to the potential of Mania. Very nice reviews...  Similar to the fragrance, the bottle is a classic design. I am drawn to the clear glass bottles to allow the user to see the clarity of the fragrance. The ""smoky"" color of the fragrance, and perhaps tint of the glass, adds to the positive mystique of the fragrance. The packaging is also well done.  A check of the online pricing of Mania, shows that it is still moderate to medium pricing (in the $50 - $100 USD) range. For that price and the quality of the scent, it is highly recommended to add this to your collection. Out of a possible five (5) stars, my evaluation of Armani Mania comes in at 4.4 stars. Great fragrance... Daily I.M. - Ride the wave and don\'t ask where it goes...', 'Nothing to become maniacal about, but not bad. It doesn\'t strike me as being especially unique or individual, and went on smelling somewhat mass market and uninteresting. The key is in the drydown, when it eventually arrives at a nice, understated woodsy note. At least it does on my skin.  This is one of those countless ""safe for office"" scents which I normally scorn. But on me it smells calculatedly pleasant, like one of those Jack Black ""Mark"" scents.  I wouldn\'t run out and buy a bottle, but I wouldn\'t spurn one, either. No sillage to speak of, longevity is a few hours.', ""I smelled this on an older gentleman who's a friend of mine (I'd guess he's 50ish) and it's SO sexy! (Don't judge me! lol) It's a very fresh, inviting peppery saffron/cedar scent complimented perfectly by just the tiniest touch of mandarin. I really really like it! If it wasn't inappropriate to sniff him I would! =P"", ""I think I misjudged this one initially that I have been wearing off and on for about a year. Citrus opener that fades quickly as a lightly floral/woodsy aroma that is fresh, at times almost powdery takes over. Hint of musk. The longevity is quite good although the lack of projection may lead you to think otherwise. Stays close to the skin but emerges in the most wonderful way as your body temp goes up a little (on a lunch hour walk). My wife had trouble even detecting it on me while we drove to work this morning, even sniffing at my wrist. Sort of shrugged her shoulders and did not demand that I stop driving and disrobe. Bummer. I would say it's good any time, any season but I'm biased living in NM where even shorts are often good any season. Classy and elegant for office use but also classy casual. I like it a lot"", 'There is something in common with Bvlgari¬¥s fragrances, maybe B.Soir or B.Pour Homme... but I agree with Thief of Hearts that noticed ""plastic eletronics"" aroma in it.

The sweetness has a similar vibe I suppose. Jaguar is much less complex, and in fact quite linear.

It is an EDC, and it performs like an EDC. I don\'t even know why EDC\'s are even produced any more. Any frag with aan atomizer should be at least an EDT. This scent profile deserves a higher concentration. The tangerine, bitter orange, cloves, and tobacco come together very nicely. This is compared to the Tom Ford for Men, which I do not have, but I have the Tom Ford for Men Extreme, which has some similarities to this but is rougher and in my opinion less smooth. But this is not a particularly well-performing EDC, nor is it a frag with ""medium performance"" as some have suggested. It\'s very much an EDC and performs as expected. But I discovered you need to apply heavily, mostly on clothes, and wait about 30 minutes after application to start getting wafts of the scent. I don\'t know if it takes that long for all that alcohol to evaporate and for the low concentration of aroma molecules to settle in or what. But I did start getting some scent wafts after 20 sprays to clothes and letting the alcohol evaporate. I had to do the same with David Beckham Instinct to get anything out of it too.

If trying to categorize this I\'d pit it close the fougeres, but with low overlap due to the lack of lavender, but it\'s close because of that sweet/sour balancing act. This remains an incredibly versatile scent, especially if like me you love cloves/eugenol in your fragrances. For a men\'s scent it\'s the tiniest bit sweet, but in an amber and citrus way, and it\'s not prominent - it combines with the chamomille to keep it more of a ""natural,"" background sweetness.

Definitely a compliment magnet. A great 'date night' fragrance, or any special occasion, or a great signature."", 'Baldessarini was the very first fragrance I ever purchased. I was in my early to mid-20s, and my knowledge of fragrances didn\'t extend beyond the scope of Axe body sprays. I felt it was time to ""grow up"", so I made my way to the department store, hastily tried a few fragrances, and quickly settled on Baldessarini. It became my signature fragrance for many years; hell, it was the only fragrance I owned for many years, and I wore it no matter the occasion. I\'ve recently started reviewing fragrances, and decided to revisit this classic after more than a decade apart. Baldessarini is what I call a \'Wow\' fragrance. What\'s a \'Wow\' fragrance? It\'s one of those fragrances where every ten minutes or so a new note will pop up out of nowhere and you\'ll say, ""Wow! I wasn\'t expecting that."" Baldessarini takes a little while to get going, but once it does you\'ll find that it has many surprises in store for you. After you spray it on, Baldessarini lingers on you for several minutes, not making an impression. You can\'t pick out any notes, and start to wonder if perhaps the bottle went bad. Slowly though, everything starts to come together, and builds to this orange/tangerine climax that absolutely blows you away. This is a citrusy fragrance, but one that you\'re probably not accustomed to. It\'s not light or airy; the orange/tangerine combo in Baldessarini has weight and depth to it. It has a richness that you just don\'t come across that often. That combo is the heart and soul of Baldessarini, but other notes such as musk and tobacco enter the picture further on down the road to change the composition of this unique creation. Baldessarini is also one of those rare fragrances that hasn\'t suffered from reformulation problems over the years. I did a side-by-side comparison of the vintage Hugo Boss-branded bottle versus the newer Baldessarini-branded bottle and I can\'t really detect any significant differences. With the vintage bottle, I did find that the orange/tangerine top note faded away a little faster than the newer bottle. I also found the tobacco note to be more prominent in the vintage bottle. In my opinion, there\'s no benefit in spending more money for vintage bottles of Baldessarini. After all these years, I still have an affinity for my very first fragrance. My only complaint with it is that the longevity and sillage aren\'t that great, but it being an eau de cologne I guess that\'s understandable. Baldessarini gives off a high-class, yet relaxed vibe; the perfect accompaniment to a suit, no tie. It\'s just the right fragrance to lead someone down the path to manhood.', 'Timelessly Elegant (Jean-Marc Chaillan & Pierre Wargnye, 2002)  Bottle Design: Lutz Herrmann Scentrack: Robert Palmer ‚Äì Know by Now At a first glance, Baldessarini Eau de Cologne seems like a simple standard released for men, loaded with citrus and devoid of any performance. However, a few miracles are hidden among the molecules. Baldessarini starts with sweet citrus fruits - orange and grapefruit, very similar to legendary PEZ candy, accompanied by a dash of mint and to my nose even with a touch of basil. In this first phase is uplifting, sunny and charmingly Mediterranean. Soon darker notes are invited, clove with its medicinal character, very pale patchouli and warm tobacco. Initial relaxed mood was upgraded with this touch of friendly seriousness. But then the magic starts. At one point the composition warms up even more with musk and amber, and unexpected fruity sweetness turns up from nowhere. The fruitiness is light and airy, yet so substantial and hard to decode. At one moment is completely fruity, on the other is almost completely radiantly floral due to the damascones. Another great feature of this composition is solid performance on my skin for the EdC.  To my nose it seems like Chaillan and Wargnye took the best from the past, and recreate the classic form for the new millennium while possessing some distant echoes from the late Escada pour Homme. Later, Tom Ford revisited the theme in much inferior Tom Ford for Men. Subsequent Baldessarini Eau de Cologne Concentre ruffled these gentle fragrant layers and totally lost the charm.  Rating: 9/10', 'It\'s masculine, but modernly masculine. I don\'t get a ""separates the men from the boys"" scent from it. It honestly leads my mind to a hair dresser saloon. There\'s something about it that has a steaming/ironing hair scent to it. It\'s fruity but earthy. There\'s an overriped fruit scent, that goes along with some chamomile and an earthy feel. The overall composition appears sophisticated - high class I actually like it a lot. Maybe I should start wearing it more often It\'s working wonders in the spring and early fall', 'Not a Hugo Boss brand any longer. At some point it changed ownership. I never tried the original (when it was under Hugo Boss), so your experience may differ. It is brilliant (and a crowd pleaser) but it does not perform well for me. Its longevity is about 3 hours. I got a second bottle with a different presentation, Concentree, which is supposed to last longer, but it also disappointed me a little bit. It lasted about 3 or 4 hours, basically the same or just a little bit more, with a stronger sillage.  I recommend you try it for longevity first.', 'By far this is the best fragrance from Hugo Boss.

The opening has a lot of alcohol but after all it\'s an edc so this is normal. It dissapears quickly. Dominant notes are beautiful tangerine mixed with tobacco, & chamomile.

Amber is very mild.\xa0 I highly recommend it for summer daytime. I usualy do 6 sprays with this edc, 3 bellow each ear which give me half an hour to 40 minutes moderate projection then it stays close to the skin. Sillage is also moderate.

Of course this is not for any average joe but it could be among the bestsellers in any niche house around. Heck...

These days I usually avoid fruity fragrances. There are some exceptions of course such as Xeryus Rouge which is a marvelous, sensual and masculine gentleman\'s scent. However most fragrances that are of the ""gourmand"" variety usually seem a bit too unisex and boyish for my tastes. Baldessarini on the other hand emits as the dominant scent, juicy mandarin orange but it is very balanced by the amber, musk and spice notes. It isn\'t too sweet or fruity. I don\'t notice any tobacco, unless that tobacco was a mandarin, amber, spice and musk fruity pipe tobacco. In other words I don\'t notice anything specifically tobacco here. Baldessarini is a gentleman\'s frangrance but not only for more mature gents like myself. A younger man could indeed wear this well. This is not an overly assertive fragrance but no weakling either. I find this to be a friendly and casual scent, very informal. However this would be an appropriate fragrance for dining with friends regardless of the cuisine. For example, no one wants their favorite sushi put off by an overly powerful fragrance that their dining companion is emanating at him. In the case of Baldessarini, the gentle but masculine scent that will waft from you will only enhance your culinary experience for your friends and yourself.

They did pull all the stops on their first release, though. It\'s great that they did so, because they created one of the greatest Eau de Cologne\'s of newer times.  It opens with a fantastic minty tangerine note. This note persist throughout the life of the fragrance. The midnotes . especially chamomille - come into play after a few minutes, complimenting the topnotes nicely. After that the tobacco and musk appears. Both notes are mixed back, allowing the fantastic top notes to shine.  The thing about this one, is that it is extremely well crafted. The blending is superb, and everything works together.  This fragrance shares some ground with Tom Ford For Men. TFFM is muskier and more focused on the tobacco, where as the Baldessarini is zestier and sticks to the Cologne style.

Described as ""woody-fruity"" by some reviewers, I surprisingly agree with the gentleman below who identified banana as one of the few notes that I can actually detect. The rest span ""from raisins to rose"", with some very gentle masculinity behind and sparsely any musk or tobacco, but maybe some bright amber below.

I get the citrus top notes, which I think is nice as well as the green notes in the dry down with tobacco and an amber/musk blending quite nicely to create a quite, mature fragrance. Projection is quite restrained,this being a Cologne and not an EDT, quite soft although people close to you can smell it on you. Longevity is a decent 5 odd hours. The smell alone is 8/10 for me. The so so projection and longevity is a bummer. This one I have noticed smells better when the weather is a little warmer as the extra heat adds to the projection a little bit.

Disliking a linear fragrance is somehow worse than disliking a scent with a traditional top, middle and base. Whereas the three-tiered fragrance might surprise you and win you over, for a linear scent, the first sniff becomes the lasting impression. A linear fragrance must have notes that can connect at various points to keep your interest. It allows for reconsideration from different perspectives and in different lights. Here is where a good linear fragrance can hold its own against a known classic. In Baldessarini, I found the saccharine sweet note unpleasant, the nose equivalent of a high-pitched whistle. The cedar-like tobacco note has no connection to this sweet note, and so the two sit uneasily side by side for the duration of their mutually linear paths. Another difficulty with the tobacco note: a botanically derived material evolves over time. When it doesn‚Äôt, a ‚Äòreference‚Äô note must be used carefully. If it simulates tobacco, but is not tobacco, and the other components to the fragrance don‚Äôt enhance it, the nose may recoil, as mine did.', ""The first blast gives me a lot of pepper and cloves.

The company has some fault in this, because their newer scents tend to be quite ""generic"" i.e. Stricly Private. A nice gourmand, but smells very similar to every other gourmand out there. They did pull all the stops on their first release, though. It\'s great that they did so, because they created one of the greatest Eau de Cologne\'s of newer times.  It opens with a fantastic minty tangerine note. This note persist throughout the life of the fragrance. The midnotes . especially chamomille - come into play after a few minutes, complimenting the topnotes nicely. After that the tobacco and musk appears. Both notes are mixed back, allowing the fantastic top notes to shine.  The thing about this one, is that it is extremely well crafted. The blending is superb, and everything works together.  This fragrance shares some ground with Tom Ford For Men. TFFM is muskier and more focused on the tobacco, where as the Baldessarini is zestier and sticks to the Cologne style.

The opening really turns me off. i don't smell much tangerine in it. it is mostly mint. i normally like mint, but this one is not good. it smells really dated. later it gets better because some sweetness comes, but it smells like air freshner instead of something really elegant and invinting. The drydown is the only pleasant phase of this fragrance. Sillage and longevity are pretty bad too. Overall an unsexy perfume for me.""]"

It's classy, smooth, and intriguing."", 'True gentleman‚Äôs fragrance. Classy, deep, elegant, timeless. Old money scent.', 'In the opening I thought it was nice and clean but as it opened up, it changed quite bit. The opening was orange blossoms and musk which gave it a clean soapy floral vibe. After that, the plum came out a little and it has a similar smell to how peach is used in chypre perfumes like Mitsuoko. Along with that is beautiful florals, mainly jasmine and heliotrope for me. The jasmine in here is pretty nice. It has an animalic almost civet like quality to it which adds a lot of depth to the dry down. The heliotrope gives it a slight powdery tinge. There is incense here but its not smoky or ashy. Instead, its a light smoke thats right behind the florals helping to give it some lift. Its got good projection and longevity on me. Plus, it wears light and airy on me too so it has some good usability. Definitely not something you should wear once and forget about cause it has more stories to tell. Worth the try for anyone who likes old school style florals with a nice modern twist.', ""I have the vintage one with the loose, ivory looking cap, and it's incredible. Strong, long-lasting and complex, I absolutely love it. The first two hours remind me of Tom Ford for Men but with way better ingredients and with the incense-floral amouage twist. It's less the smell that's the resemblance than the feel of the perfume (I came home and sprayed one on each arm and they're very different but of the same ilk). The drydown goes in a direction I wouldn't have seen coming save for some reviews here. It becomes fluffy and floral, with the creamy frankincense ebbing away underneath, absolutely gorgeous, and a credit to the perfumer because on card, I detect some sort of stinky synthetic just for a few seconds in the opening (not on skin) so this could easily have been one of the pantheon of perfumes which degenerate into some blah generic woody amber base. Here, it couldn't be further from that. This is beautiful, top-notch perfumery. It's eminently wearable in any conditions, unlike a lot of Amouages, so for me that's a real score too. Shame this 50ml will probably be my first and last due to how discontinued AF it is. It's worth noting that the pyramid above doesn't really represent the experience of smelling this perfume. All the notes are there, but it's very united, one exquisitely crafted scent, very old-school, no overload of any one thing like everyone does now."", 'At first I thought ‚ÄúOk good, next!‚Äù But with use It grown on me a lot! It‚Äôs not as linear as people describe it, It has real depth compared to other perfumes in this style. The white florals are settle and high class, The woody backbone give it a real depth and richness (not overpowering at all). Impressive longevity for a perfume this style, Quality is amazing. Not a classy fougere at all!  I understand why some people would find it feminine but I love it. Hope to find a different replacement for it since it‚Äôs discontinued.', 'Fougere, soapy, nice and rather mediocre. Maybe that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs discontinued. Very unlike Amouage.', ""This is a clean, soapy, slightly powdery, mostly white floral fragrance. Very elegant, feminine leaning even. The muskiness keeps it from being completely female.  For some reason the scent strongly reminds me of a shaving soap/aftershave/cologne from Crown King (Phoenix Artisan) - Tokyo Rose - which is mostly a Rose scent, with fill list of notes including Rose, Cherry, Ambergris, Sandalwood, Oud, Amyris & Cardamom. It's certainly unique and not an easy pull for those afraid to come off slightly feminine.

I thought of sharing my experience so that it might help those who wish to expend big cash on a vintage bottle of your favourite Amouage thinking vintage is even better. I‚Äôm confused. Based on the reviews I was expecting a much superior version of new Silver Man. But it‚Äôs way different, I didn‚Äôt like it at all. There is no resemblance between vintage Silver cologne and new Silver man. This is more like typical cologne, not very complex, missing all those floral notes, and where is frankincense?? Am I missing something? Or this vintage juice gone bad? I have to believe my sample gone bad, because all other reviews here and in Basenotes tell otherwise.', 'Zesty and barbershopy in the opening, but turns into a white floral fragrance in the drydown. Silver Cologne is a very good fragrance in the beginning ‚Äî it‚Äôs very elegant, versatile, refreshing and a gentleman scent in the first 2 hours after application. The citruses and plum give this fragrance a very appealing sweet facet. However, the next phase it‚Äòs a completely different ballgame. The flowers are taking over and it‚Äôs linear until the end of the longevity. Dare I say turning the scent feminine. Not even a faintly detectable notes of vetiver and incense can balance it out. It‚Äôs still good, though. I‚Äôm just giving a heads-up for anybody who‚Äôs not up for a significant change in the drydown. The projection is really strong for the first hour, but quickly dies down into a moderate level. Longevity is 7 hours-ish.

Not the best in the line but an interesting Oriental take on the barbershop cologne. Quite lovely.

The florals remind me of the floral accord on Parfums de Marly Lippizan. Frankincense is the main note but well blended with the rest of the notes.

Very floral and very feminine. Hard Pass!', 'I find myself craving to wear this, especially when it\'s warm out. There is a little mystery in how this plays with my chemistry. I feel like the initial freshness is so sharp that it might be confusing to figure out. And I can 100% see how someone might find this reminiscent of baby wipes, or a common clean type of scent. It is a bit powdery, but I feel that hits hardest in the beginning. Those first 30 minutes are kind of a ride to be honest. But I like the ride, and the time spent with this is well worth it on my skin. I think the heliotrope and orchid accord are also quite prominent throughout much of this fragrance. The freshness is easy, and the muskiness is my absolute favorite part. It\'s so smooth on my skin. I love the sensuousness it wraps around me. The musk is light, fluffy, and almost cloud like. I find this aspect of the dry down fascinating. It almost feels like a second skin. There is definitely a ""your skin but better"" thing going on here. I also appreciate that this perfume goes through stages of development. It gets cozy. I wish this weren\'t discontinued, but I do understand why. It\'s not as stand out as some of other things out there. It\'s longevity is 4-5 hours so that might be a little skint for some people. All I know is that I really do love this. There is something intriguingly addictive about it to me. The fresh baby aspects of this go in two distinctly different paths as this develops. You do get the baby powder drifting through the air and settling into a more dusty cloud. Then it progressively becomes more herbaceous, and clean. Lighter and lighter, but the lighter it gets, the more I want to be cuddling with someone. It\'s a classy, fresh, posh, sort of baby vibe. Such a clean and comfortable, understated elegance. I\'m all in.', 'Soapy powdery, lean more towards feminine side. Its smells like when you scrub your body with soap bar then you leave it until it dry on your skin. Just go look for other fragrances.', 'first time i smell this i just feel this so fresh to me!!!! and i fallin love with this perfume elegant Yes!  sexy yes! and also seduction.. i got compliments from this one... unfortunately longevity is only 5 hours on me', 'I am a big fan of this cologne. The opening is a perfectly balanced blend of woody and floral. There is also a sharp note of what i think is usually called a ""white"" scent. The dry down is even more pleasant, as it tends toward less woody and more floral. The dry down reminds me strongly of Creed Vetiver Geranium, even though there\'s no Vetiver in Silver Cologne.  There\'s also a slight powdery note in the opening but it is not unpleasant. Performance isn\'t good on my skin but I usually spray fragrances on my clothes as well and, as usual, it performs much better on my clothes. I could still smell it on my shirt the next day.  Overall, I give Silver Man an 8/10. It can be found online for less than $200 and I believe it to be a good value.', 'I wrote a good review to soon. Smells great but it turns out to be nothing but fragrant water. I have never been disappointed by Amouage until now. When a House releases a fragrance every few months and their claim to fame is it is made for sultan I should have stopped ordering Amouage blind. Silver man last about 30 minutes and the quality is that of a drugstore. Not worth more than 5.00. I have lost all faith in Amouage. This House has lost my trust. They have gone from exceptional to a disgusting rip off. I will stay with those I trust Chanel, Dolce Gabbana etc.', 'Another beautiful floral from The House of Amouage. I love it.

A nice smell but very messy and confused...or confusing, which I dare say that wasn't the grand artistic vision.  As another poster has said, it's nearly impossible to pick out the individual notes - but for me it's just too much, all jumbled up - then it fades, without much development.  This lack of clarity is a particularly bad thing for me. It means I cannot intellectualise or pontificate about the fragrance; nor can I determine if the fragrance has triumphed in being 'more than a sum of its parts/ingredients'. Just as bad is the lack of interesting development here, which also means I don't have anything slightly different to smell later in the day. Worse, it means it isn't well blended. And it's too sweet. (I did try it in 25-degree heat, so it might just be better suited to cooler weather. Either that or my summer-time eau de cologne usage has bent my nose towards lighter things. This swamped it.) I don't get any of the silver metallic accord either, and instead, here, see it as a failed variation of the far superior Gold, which is a much finer example of a whacky, men's floral."", 'Nice fresh scent by amouage.  Citrus + floral+ green mixture. No oud. Good for office and official events. Never disturbing to people around you. Its different from fresh scents by designers. I use this whenever i dont know what to wear. Comforting, Long lasting with moderate sillage.', 'A nice citrus, floral, fruity mix that screams of spring and fresh blooms with a little bit of sweetness at first leading to clean and bright. Easily the best take on ""orchid"" I‚Äôve smelled to date, orchid notes can often be too cloying and extremely feminine but they managed to tame them and bring more fresh clean springtime aspects to the fore, perhaps with the combo of the other florals. I do like this to smell, but not to wear as I do find it a touch too feminine for my taste but it has definite quality and you would absolutely smell unique and classy wearing this if you can pull it off. I think women could easily wear this and smell great too. I think for something in this style, an MFK fragrance like Aqua Universalis fits me better although I am not saying they smell the same but they sit in the same bright and clean fresh genre.', 'REVIEW - AMOUAGE SILVER What does it smell like? - A floral-clean and natural smelling perfume. Spring in a bottle. TOP - Amouage Silver starts very floral. Dry and floral. Almost every type of flowers start hitting you right from the off. On my skin,Orange Blossom and Heliotrope are the most common giving it a fresh dry floral opening that has only one feeling written on it - HAPPINESS. The top notes are backed by some musk which make the top smell very sophisticated too. MID - This is one of the most heart notes that I\'ve ever smelled. It\'s the best part of this perfume and it comes quickly at you. 5-10 minutes into the fragrance and PLUM and JASMINE start hitting your nose. This accord here is so creamy, accomplished and pleasing. It feels very natural and familiar being unique at the same time as well.  Drydown - The drydown is where you understand why this perfume is called SILVER. It gets metallic and aquatic. And idk how. It reminds me of Silver Mountain Water at this phase in a very vague manner. Some of it\'s by the plum,some by a sharp but very faint rose and equally faint and sweet and faint Incense note.  The drydown gets creamier too thanks to the sandalwood.  Feelings - This could be a perfect ""Dad\'s perfume"". It has some slight barbershop element to it initially thanks to the dry floral feel which I absolutely love. Feels very happy. Uplighting and natural. Clean floral. Performance - It pushes upto the 8 hours mark on my skin at times. Averaging 6-7 hours consistently. Siliage and Projection are both on the softer side. It close to skin after some good projection initially. Though it\'s very captivating and unique. So it\'s not the perfume that\'s going to be loud but instead whoever\'s going to smell this is going to stay close to you. Intoxicating. Usage - Unisex - Over 28 years. It\'s an Amouage and it\'s perfect for what it is. Somehow it has managed to stay lowkey and thus I call it a hidden gem and a successful unique discovery.', 'Apparently has recently been discontinued (no longer on official website).', ""@ThePharaoh: Too bad it doesn't last on you, such a wonderful perfume. I think it might be the skin chemistry? Silver is one of the most long lasting perfumes in my collection, even better than Gold, or may be a reformulation?"", 'Very well balanced. This is a master class on how to make an elegant citrus fragance.', ""Summer in a bottle. This is very underated, one of the best Amouage. Quality of the ingradients and blending is superb. Very unique and original, soapy barbershop theme is nicely complimented with a bouquet of beautiful floral and sexy animalic undertone. Animalic accord is well done here, unlike in Gold which I find too much in your face. Scent trail is mesmerizing. Now let's talk about performance, Amouge never fail in perfomance category, but this is a performance monster. It will easily last more than 12 hours with a very good projection. Today I wore this around 7am in the morning and I can still smell even at 10pm. Such a wonderful masculine sexy scent, wear with confidence. This is one of the best masculine floral perfumes out there.."", 'We are in March, but outside is cold and snow all over the place. Silver Man has no power for such weather conditions.

I would wear it if gifted to me but for the price, I would prefer the amazing New Musk Man by Dame Perfumery to get my plum fix, sharing several similar notes with Silver but composed in varying amounts.', 'I do not know about the similarity with Ciel Man, yet, but I will have Ciel as well, but I do know that is a lot like Amoage Gold Man. Gold is more powerful because of the animalic civet and has more rose in it. Silver it has more plum.

This is their take on the concept of the traditional ‚Äúcologne‚Äù and, as can be expected from a non-conformist firm like Amouage, the result is indeed a novel interpretation of the genre. ‚ÄúSilver Man‚Äù starts off with a burst of citruses and fruit, namely bergamot, mandarin orange and plum. And although these notes linger for a while, it soon becomes obvious theirs is merely a supporting role. The true centrepiece of the composition is the white flower accord. First, there‚Äôs a generous dose of orange blossom whose effect is later intensified by the emergence of jasmine. While some readers might be wondering if the folks at Amouage have not made a major marketing blunder when it comes to the intended gender of its target customers, I assure you that despite containing several notes normally used in female-oriented scents, ‚ÄúSilver‚Äù can indeed be classified as a proper unisex/an unconventional masculine scent. (Actually, hesitant gentlemen may eventually be won over in the drydown during which the cologne‚Äôs chest grows a little hairier thanks to the addition of musk.) To sum up, Amouage have done a very decent job tweaking the original idea behind the classic ‚Äúeau de cologne‚Äù and managed to produce a refined, top-quality, feel-good fragrance, absolutely worthy of this reputable company. Let the summer begin!', 'Amouage Silver (2002). Originally called Silver Cologne. An oriental take on a classical western Chypre which deviated from the Amouage style/monotony and failed as a market experiment but is nothing short of a treasure for perfume connoisseurs. The opening is a blast of soapy powdery green pungent mixed florals bouquet (the so called floral aldehydes) which comes as a nasal assault. This is where most complex pefumes fail to impress and silver too succumbs to the usage of too many ingredients. The balance could have made it a hot seller. It fails to introduce its capability in the opening. However, the ones patient enough will soon see the white light break into a colorful spectrum of transitional olfactory brilliance. The juicy fruity plum, the sharp velvet rose, the minty patchouli, the dense oakmoss and earthy vetiver and the drowning sandalwood. It flows like poetry soon joined by a blast of sweet pungent musk. The incense is the odd note and it just Ramboes into the orchestra with its raw soapy detergent lemony muscles. But, to the ones catching its powerful trail on you, it is a perfume. It is what stops many strangers in the way just to take a little sniff of the magical ripples it creates in the air. A remarkable achievement. The Amouage chamaleon which will haunt you throughout the day with its everchanging colors. I always succumb to it :-).', 'Silver Man was released in 2002 and at that time, was called Silver Cologne. The reason for the change is unknown, although I have researched the subject and I came across an information different from what is disclosed: it seems that Silver Cologne was actually released in 1998 and the name change came in 2002, although no reformulation occurred at that time. The perfumer was Evelyne Boulanger, who has already signed creations for Comme des Garcons, Armani, Givenchy, O Boticario, Jacques Bogart, among other renowned brands. According to the company, Silver Man has notes of bergamot, mandarin, plum and orange blossom, at the top of the olfactory pyramid. Then, the heart is enriched with notes of jasmine, rose, orchid, ylang-ylang and heliotrope. At the base we have notes of amber, musk, patchouli, sandalwood and frankincense. It is described as a woody-spicy scent with accented nuances of orange blossom and mandarin. But on my skin, it behaved as a beautiful floral-metallic, perfectly shareable and very consistent with its name.  Silver Man touches the skin rudely, without mercy and without fear of offending. The orange blossom and the mandarin confer citric acidity, which is balanced by the note of plum - beautiful, juicy and slightly sweet. The floral profile comes with the heart, lighter and strangely metalized. It is common to see fragrances with this aspect, through the use of aldehydes and notes of violets. But here, this metallic aspect comes from the rose, very pleasantly. Particularly, I love it! The ylang-ylang flower usually has sweet, exotic nuances, but that is not how it behaves in this creation. It is not here to draw attention from what really matters. And at the end of the journey, when the evolution is complete, I feel the lightness of the musk and the creaminess of the sandalwood. Silver Man is not the most complex perfume of the house and certainly not the one that most symbolizes the Eastern route traced by the company. But it is an extremely elegant, versatile perfume, full of power and durability. Silver Man is the next step for lovers of fragrances that follow this style, such as Chanel Platinum √âgo√Øste, for instance. And I say more: if a mass-market company could reproduce something like that, it would be a huge sales success.', ""Many fragrances by Amouage are exotic but too much heavy for daily. On the other hand, Silver it's a vibrant woody floral musk with an exotic vibe but not loud in the resinous side. Not very manly but neither feminine. In fact, this classified for men.  Another thing that I like of Silver it's the versatility and timeless style. Then, suitable for many ocassions and seasons. If you search an Amouage polyvalent fragrance and not sharp, this it's for you.

Day and night, in office or at a dinner.. both elegant and casual, easy wearable, powerful but inoffensive. A proper 100% masculine scent for all occasions. It is clearly a woody, spicy, floral scent, bright and vivid, so refined, so well blended that you won't pass in front of people unnoticed! Silver is a compliment receiver, both men and women like it. It opens a little citrusy and floral, vivid and fresh. As time passes, it becomes smoother, deeper, more aromatic with the flowers coming up to the surface. Just close your eyes and you'll be transfered in a garden full of flowers, a romantic scent suitable for evenings full with passion. At the end I feel a little soapy note and something earthy-green. There is slightly a sweetness in the scent, but very discreet almost invisible. The longevity is about 9-10 hours and the projection is heavy for the first hours. I recomend it for all year round use but especially for fall, spring and summer. The most distinguished notes I get are jasmine, orange blossom, ylang-ylang, plum, orchid, musk, rose, incense and bergamot. I can feel the other notes but they aren't so strong.  Generally I like it, worth every cent. I thing that I'll buy it again. I am happy and pleased from this magic juice!"", ""Well I've finally had the chance to try this, and can now understand why it's so overlooked compared to the other Amouages. It lacks all of the complexity and quality of the other Amouages. Even Reflection Man seems highly complex compared to this. It's not a terrible scent at all, if you want a decent citrus woody scent, this will deliver the goods. But at that price I expect perfect and this simply doesn't offer that. The opening is nicely done. A fresh floral-fruity opening with sour citrus and lots of orange blossom and plum. At this stage it's very well crafted and smells very nice. The heart is a big floral affair. On paper it sounds fantastic, but in real life it's lots of jasmine and orchid. Jasmine can perfectly in fragrances, but it comes across as cheap and one-dimensional in this composition. I'm not sure what it is, but the florals really feel flat in this. The base is a typical musky woodsy affair. There is a hint of that silver incense that Amouage are so renowned for, but it's very subdued. What bugs me is that on paper, Silver is highly complex. But when I smell it, it falls flat. It's attempting to be overtly complex, and it somehow looses lots of character due to this. Overall if you just wan't a supercharged cologne style fragrance, then Silver is good. But to me it's just not great. There are so many other better citrus based scents out there at half or a quarter of the price, and I'd buy any of those and pocket the rest. However, I don't want to be unfair either. Silver is a very good fragrance. If I found a bottle at a great price, I'd go for it. But overall I just can't recommend it. The alternatives in this genre are so much better in my opinion. Longevity is ok - 4-5 hours. Rating: 5/10"", ""Amouage Silver Man is appropriately-named, given the metallic, musky, fresh spicy vibe that I get from it. The opening is a burst of floral and fresh spices, enhanced perhaps by the citruses I see in the notes breakdown but do not detect much of individually. Orange blossom factors in somewhat, especially at the opening, but quickly gives way to a variety of florals and a woody musk mix that doesn't sit well with me. As in many cases, it's not the sharpness in the opening that is prohibitive for me but the odd fruity/musky dry down that is simply displeasing, but I realize that this is just a matter of opinion is that is not one of the crowd favorites among Amouage fragrances. Projection is decent but longevity leaves a little bit to be desired. Sample first, for sure. 5 out of 10"", 'Very nice fragrance, got an EDT sample from it, it lasts over 12 hours on my skin. It has a nice heart note in which I detect the plum-sweetness and a creamy vibe. It is very pleasant to the nose, nothing itchy, everything is mild, it projects very good for over 7-8 hours. It is a nice frag, I do not know how it goes in hot weather but its high sweet note could be rather cloying and stinky. It is good as an everyday scent for autumn-winter-spring.

To me it is sophisticated and has lots of character.', 'It starts with very lively tangerine note which is perceived as light.  The middle and base notes are seamlessly blended and perfectly balanced thus no note dominates. Just the plum is clearly identifiable all the time.

There isn\'t enough note separation and the dynamism is rather limited. Basically it\'s too tight and gentle, almost ""cute."" Get some vintage Chaps and let the good times roll, one might say! Silver is more for a person who owns many horses but doesn\'t want to get too close to them, ever.

I don't neven know what else to say."", ""It may seem precipitous to conduct an induction based on two cases, but after smelling Amouage ARCUS and SILVER, I recognize a pattern developing before my nose. Expensive men's colognes are always fully unisex. SILVER offers another beautifully woven blend which to my nose is impossible to dissect. What I smell is something with a texture very much like a piece of supple silver mesh. It's not a shiny metallic smell but rather the matte mesh scent of ambergris which has been tinged with many other scents to the point where I can only say that the sum total is a very appealing blend.  This creation boasts myriad flowers: orange blossom, heliotrope, jasmine, orchid, rose, and ylang. The florals undoubtedly impart a richness to this cologne, but they are not individually discernible, so no one would ever call this an orange blossom or a jasmine or a rose or any other specific floral composition. The flowers seem essential to the integrity of the whole, but somehow they are not at all salient. Nor, on the other hand, do the characteristically masculine woody notes stick out in any way.  SILVER is the sort of perfume, a rarity these days, which I imagine must have taken years to create. I would describe SILVER as a modern floral unisex blend.

Originally called Silver Cologne. An oriental take on a classical western Chypre which deviated from the Amouage style/monotony and failed as a market experiment but is nothing short of a treasure for perfume connoisseurs. The opening is a blast of soapy powdery green pungent mixed florals bouquet (the so called floral aldehydes) which comes as a nasal assault. This is where most complex pefumes fail to impress and silver too succumbs to the usage of too many ingredients. The balance could have made it a hot seller. It fails to introduce its capability in the opening. However, the ones patient enough will soon see the white light break into a colorful spectrum of transitional olfactory brilliance. The juicy fruity plum, the sharp velvet rose, the minty patchouli, the dense oakmoss and earthy vetiver and the drowning sandalwood. It flows like poetry soon joined by a blast of sweet pungent musk. The incense is the odd note and it just Ramboes into the orchestra with its raw soapy detergent lemony muscles. But, to the ones catching its powerful trail on you, it is a perfume. It is what stops many strangers in the way just to take a little sniff of the magical ripples it creates in the air. A remarkable achievement. The Amouage chamaleon which will haunt you throughout the day with its everchanging colors. I always succumb to it :-).', ""This is a clean, soapy, slightly powdery, mostly white floral fragrance. Very elegant, feminine leaning even. The muskiness keeps it from being completely female.  For some reason the scent strongly reminds me of a shaving soap/aftershave/cologne from Crown King (Phoenix Artisan) - Tokyo Rose - which is mostly a Rose scent, with fill list of notes including Rose, Cherry, Ambergris, Sandalwood, Oud, Amyris & Cardamom.

Growing up in a Florida tourist town, the souvenir shops would have giant crates of seashells, sponges, and other dead, dried-up marine life, including starfish. All kinds of species, too - not just the kind native to the waters of Florida, but from other faraway countries, where such practices as harvesting starfish would not be illegal back in the 90s.  As I would hold them up to the sunlight and observe them, I would give the underside a little sniff and immediately be reminded of how the tidal areas of the coast smell at low tide. Briny is the word, it is almost a taste you can detect in the salty air. However, there was an animalistic quality here, something that had me smelling it again. I brought one home and would smell it occasionally, jolted by the refreshing marine rot. I am being serious here, real Florida boy.  I ordered a sample as I am skeptical of early 2000s scents. The starfish note, the birch, the pepper, and basil - this is beautifully mixed. Such a calming, natural vibe. I can not bring myself to splurge on the full bottle as they are fetching well over $100.  The original bottle came in a plastic sunglasses-looking case, which held the bottle of a similar shape in place.

It was truly a very unique and beautiful creation and one of the best that this company had released in many years. Team Calvin Klein made a huge mistake in the marketing of this fragrance ... as if it were a common, sporty scent for the 25 and under crowd. They even released it in a cheap, sporty plastic bottle so you could toss it in a gym bag. What a careless, clueless blunder. They finally had a small masterpiece on their hands and didn\'t even know it. What they actually released was a stunning fragrance that smelled like nothing else on the market at that time. Being that this came out in 2002, I firmly believe this fragrance inspired the very popular Bvlgari Aqva and all it\'s flankers. (They didn\'t get released until 2004 and beyond.) It\'s not as seaweed heavy as any of those, thank goodness, but rather way more appealing and sexy. It\'s mind boggling to see the reviews calling this a ""generic freshie."" I suppose the plastic bottle and silly advertisement provoked their misguided judgement. It\'s fresh alright, and it may even be a little sporty, but this particular blend has enough depth and character to raise it way above the sporty/fresh genre. It actually creates an intriguing and enticing scent bubble for all ages, one that\'s in a league of its own. The compliment factor for this scent is staggering. Every single time I have worn it I receive multiple compliments, where ever I go. It definitely projects for hours and has great longevity.

The drydown of Man heads into another direction, more woody and soapy, than Crave but the first 2 hours of Man are almost identical if my memory doesn't fails me.  Calvin Klein Man is also an oldie but from the same era. Maybe you Crave lovers can still have a taste of Crave as Man is still available for a steal, 100 ml for 20 Euro's.

Not a big fan of the drydown, but do appreciate the opening scent and the memories it brings. I bought a bottle recently for that purpose. Speaking of which, the packaging is stylish for its time and convenient. Still holds up to this day as I can take it on the go without worrying about breaking it.

After quite some time of searching and hunting for it, I finally got the bottle of Crave! What can I say about it...... Yes, it IS quite different from our usual summer frags. It is much woodier and bitter-er than most of them. And, what's more important, it's NOT another clone of Oh So Popular fragrances like AdG, CW, BdC, and (God forbid!) DS. Crave is a very much unique fragrance with its own character. See above: it's woodier, bitter-er, and aromatic-er! So, although it did cost me quite a fortune (could buy ~2/3 of bottle of Xerjoff Nio for that money), I'm very happy to have it! It's quite possible that it won't become one of my Top-3 summer frags, but I value it at the very least(!) as a thing with high collector value.

Opens with a marine freshness and citrus scent, the starfish and bergamot. As it dries down, the herb and spice notes become more apparent, as the basil, coriander and pimento come through. Finally the wood and musk begins to dominate. Overall, I would describe this as a fresh and clean fragrance, most suitable for summer days and for younger or more active men. The longevity and sillage are moderate, but nothing is more than moderate on me for some reason. Creed Aventus really projects well on me for about an hour but that's an exception.  I came across this Calvin Klein fragrance by chance when a friend of mine was moving and asked me to take care of some of his things, but he did have some interesting EDT in his collection.. scents I would normally deem too cheap or too common - I can be a touch pretentious - but this one was my favourite of the bunch.

As you negotiate a particularly difficult turn, there's a pretentious highschool kid on the other side that you nearly run over. Just as you brush past him, you get a hint of his cologne.

In the salty, citrus, semi woody category that leans toward Tom Ford Costa Azzurra or Creed Erolfa, but does not really mimic either of those luxury fragrances. Crave is slightly more citrus than either of those. While it may be polarizing due to uniquely being at the intersection of the ""out at sea"" and ""beachy"" subcategories of aquatics, its relative uniqueness in this sense makes Crave all the more intriguing, and it occupies its own space between the citrus and coconut beach fragrances and the salty, woody marine fragrances. For a summer EDT, Crave\'s projection and longevity are both strong, especially its opening. It becomes a skin scent within a couple of hours but does last beyond the 6 hour mark. There is some inconsistency in the listing of one of the top notes, as I\'ve seen either ""starfruit"" or ""starfish"" but never both. I\'d assume the fruit and not the animal, but I\'m not sure I\'d know how to detect either. Same goes for the lichen, as I\'d expect animal products to be avoided, though this fragrance is now 13 years old. As another side note, the spray bottle is slightly cumbersome (I find this to be the case with the off-center sprayer of Nautica Classic / Blue, as well), but that\'s separate from the scent itself.

You have to look closely to identify a few notes. The Pimento (Red Pepper?) is the most prominent note on my skin. Although it feels synthetyc, it gives me the same feeling that real pepper does. I can also smell the vetyver and the bergamot. The bergamot keeps it citrus and slightly sweet. The vetyver keeps it fresh and masculine. I get little nutmeg along with the pepper, but no marine notes at all. Even being a little 'bland', is not a bad fragrance. I particularly don't give it high notes (i bought it and gave it away, cause is nothing special) but i know that is not a bad fragrance, just not my taste. Best suitable for spring and summer, day or nights. Very young, i could see the model in the ad wearing this. A ripped guy trying to look sexier than he actually is.

I didn\'t smell basil at all, and the coriander is a tad raw... as for the base, the oakmoss component also seems weakly artificial and the vetiver (which I love) was disappointingly short lived.

Even in the checked luggage, no worries of breakage, and you can spray it with or without fully removing the bottle. This is great because it's also the perfect background scent for a holiday or vacation: summery, sunny and fresh. However, it has a depth. Of all my vetivers, this is the youngest and sauciest take on that classic note. Not like my favorite classy Chanels pour homme or other CKs. It was smart to mix the classic base with a joyous top.

In 10 minutes of wearing it I got 4 compliments and more as the day went on (majority being women). Wore it to a party and everyone went crazy over how good it smelled. Yeah, it can be labeled as your typical fresh scent, but it is quite different from anything else out. At least until Givenchy Play Sport came along with its much more floral clone cousin which doesn't last at all or compare IMHO. Its the perfect spring and summer scent. It smells like a blast of citrus while sitting on the beach on a hot summer day with a very sexy masculine appeal. Believe me I know, I live in So Cal.

The starfish note is actually an inspiration for the exact-most (it's a word now) essence of the salty sea that can be captured via smell (see the description).

To be frank, I'm not sure exactly how to put it, but it's perfect representation of capturing the sea by smell, if only for wider-knowledge of the relationship between starfish and it's representation OF the sea smell. So the smell: the opening bergamot is very dominant and kind of alienating, actually. But with that pure essence of the sea, when the bergamot finally settles, it is a good mix for an opening.

While it may be polarizing due to uniquely being at the intersection of the ""out at sea"" and ""beachy"" subcategories of aquatics, its relative uniqueness in this sense makes Crave all the more intriguing, and it occupies its own space between the citrus and coconut beach fragrances and the salty, woody marine fragrances. For a summer EDT, Crave\'s projection and longevity are both strong, especially its opening. It becomes a skin scent within a couple of hours but does last beyond the 6 hour mark. There is some inconsistency in the listing of one of the top notes, as I\'ve seen either ""starfruit"" or ""starfish"" but never both. I\'d assume the fruit and not the animal, but I\'m not sure I\'d know how to detect either. Same goes for the lichen, as I\'d expect animal products to be avoided, though this fragrance is now 13 years old. As another side note, the spray bottle is slightly cumbersome (I find this to be the case with the off-center sprayer of Nautica Classic / Blue, as well), but that\'s separate from the scent itself. In conclusion, this is worth a try if you\'re in the market for a warm weather fragrance. 7 out of 10', 'The best fresh parfum of all time. Everytime that i wear This i understand How is fantastic.', ""Something about Crave drives me nuts - in a good way. It opens with the bergamot, nothing unusual about that. Maybe it's the Basil and Coreander that follows, maybe the starfish note that gives a bit of a salty direction, or maybe it's the birch wood. I can't really tell what makes this so special to me. It doesn't really compare to B United and Jaguar Classic Motion - they're both good but miss that special something of Crave that I can't define. Whatever it is, to me Crave is unique and the most interesting fragrance Calvin Klein ever made. I wish they'd bring it back."", 'I wish they would bring this back. This is a super crisp, masculine citrus scent. It came in a really unique plastic bottle with a button on the side to spray it. It‚Äôs very fresh, youthful, very very sporty, and REALLY good. The first CK frag I ever bought, wore it all the time in high school. I‚Äôve never met anyone else who wore it. It reminds me almost of a modernized ‚ÄúTommy Hilfiger-esque‚Äù scent, very detectable citrus notes, energizing and uplifting, probably the ultimate gym-bag scent. This is not a luxury fragrance in any way, it‚Äôs not bold and spicy, just super sporty and pleasant. I wish CK would release something like this again, a really fresh citrus sport scent for men. It‚Äôs in my top 3 favorite CK scents along with CK All and Eternity. You might even say it‚Äôs kind of a combination of those two, not specifically any notes, but the overall character of the scent: the citrus of CK All, and the crisp masculinity of Eternity. I may order a bottle from scentmatchers.com, which specializes in matching discontinued scents. 8.0/10', ""Well I have to say my previous review was a bit reactionary :-/ but upon reading the whole review I remember my outrage being on the lowest possibility that a synthetic starfish note would exist due to zero demand for the unknown smell of a starfish. Though I still agree with the logic itself, I was dead wrong about the note. The starfish note is actually an inspiration for the exact-most (it's a word now) essence of the salty sea that can be captured via smell (see the description). I'm glad I was wrong and I no longer wish for Klein, Cassar, Gaurin and Chaillan to f$&‚Ç¨ themselves, but should they feel adventurous, I won't judge. To be frank, I'm not sure exactly how to put it, but it's perfect representation of capturing the sea by smell, if only for wider-knowledge of the relationship between starfish and it's representation OF the sea smell. So the smell: the opening bergamot is very dominant and kind of alienating, actually. But with that pure essence of the sea, when the bergamot finally settles, it is a good mix for an opening. The whole scent is aquatic, fresh, cool and honestly, yes, generic. But the scent over all is a good casual scent for summer days, nuff said.  Very casual fragrance for AU$29 is a very easy buy, but I have enough casual scents and I'm not one for citrusy openings so I dont place it in the want list."", ""Oh well, another one of those fragrances where the sharp fork in the sinus synthetic sour note obscures the rest of the composition. That note is tenacious- couldn't scrub it off. Glad I only got a sample."", 'Just okay. Yes the bottle is cheap but if that was it I would not care. It just doesnt last long enough or project well. I do like the smell in fact I like it a lot. Would not purchase again because it just doesnt last long enough', 'Very weak scent for me. Horrible longevity and sillage.

I sneaked to his bathroom cabinet when he was out and found the bottle - Marc Jacob. I had to get it. Fast forward a few months and i'm in Portugal on a golfing holiday with family and family friends. My older brother's scent at the time was Paul Smith and he wore it like he bathed in it. A plethora of compliments everywhere he went on how great he smelled. Up steps yours truly, wearing this Marc Jacob scent.  One after the other I hear women saying to their friends or partner, 'Mmm what is that lovely smell?' Before long they would try to sniff out who was wearing it and land on me, begging me to tell them what i was wearing. Night after night i'd have women coming up to me asking to sniff me, then walking away satisfied.  My brother by this time was becoming agitated, and would insist on them smelling his Paul Smith, the response being, 'Yeah don't get me wrong that's nice, but, THAT is, *face literally pressed against my neck and earlobe* ahh my god that is amazing.'  The attraction i got was literally insane. The longevity weren't bad but wasn't great either which is why i sprayed my top aswell as my skin to prolong the smell. All in all though, in the warm climate this made women giddy at the knees and pulled me some gorgeous women during those 7 days, and i'm not exactly an oil painting.  Everytime i smell this now it brings back some great, no TRULY great memories. I've worn many fragrances but never received anywhere near the attention this got."", ""It was the night of my 18 birthday in 2007 when I first smelled this on someone. It was so different to whatever else the guys were wearing back then. It stuck out so much I had to buy a bottle - probably using up my week's student allowance... I love it. I have probably outgrown it by a few years, but I keep a bottle to bring back the memories. A shame that it's been discontinued. I have only smelled it 2-3 times on anyone else. Not revolutionary by any means, but a great unique fragrance of it's time."", 'I bought a bottle of this in 2004 and I thought I had read that it was a gardenia scent. Apparently I was confusing this with the feminine fragrance of the same name. However, the entire time I wore this (2004-2005) I smelled gardenia and musk in this because that‚Äôs what the power of suggestion can do. In retrospect, it‚Äôs not that far-fetched since green and floral notes combine with coconut and fig to create a soft unisex creamy floral that can, with some misinformation, make the leap to gardenia. So I am sticking with my original description of this in its‚Äô vintage prime: Marc Jacobs Man once smelled like a memory, something washed away by rain and time, of a glamorous dandy in white tie and black sequined tuxedo slippers, wearing a fresh gardenia boutonniere still chilled, straight from the florist‚Äôs fridge. It‚Äôs not the kind of scent that paints a vivid picture, crisp with detail. It‚Äôs more like a watercolor or a blurry photograph. And that is appropriate for Marc Jacobs who often takes gaudiness of fashion past and recontextualizes it by presenting it in a new way in the blurred, light-saturated, pale photographs of Juergen Teller.', 'I was utterly in love with this fragrance when it was first launched...

The salty sea breeze blends with the aromas of the trees, the herbs and the flowers as they coexist in an incredible balance. I think that this perfume is the only one I have tried that is able to convey all these with such clarity as it manages to recreate in a totally three dimensional space this Mediterranean vibrant landscape and its wild but also balanced beauty. I recall my father and our endless walks at those fields where he used to define certain herbs or flowers, to tell stories about them or to reveal to me some of their secrets. I still remember our favorite place under the cypress where we used to gaze at a colorful sea of trees at the one side and the real one at the other and also swimming during the summer time. The salty fresh air and the intense aromas of the fig trees with the cypress in a superb coexistence is what I mostly detect at this perfume and this is the main reason that I adore it as it instantly places me to this landscape and awakes all those precious memories."", ""I am on my 2nd 125 ml bottle.

It is indeed fig and coconut, and opens green and creamy, and not very sweet. The combination is very tropical and refreshing, but it shares some of the bug spray aspect that intrudes into my enjoyment of Tommy Bahama...just a slight chemical edge. It starts to get less green and more spicy after a few minutes, with a little bit of the rubber smell of brand new sneakers. The green foliage also starts to return, but this time it's musty and fetid, and no longer tantalizing. Fangorn forest, where the Ents live, probably smells like this. I like how the stuff never gets out of hand in terms of sweetness, but as it progresses it just gets too dirty and staid. By the end, there's a big component of soggy, rotten rubber from an old shoe, with the foliage of an office ficus trying to keep it pleasant. There are so many better fig fragrances that it's a bit of a waste of time in that arena, but it's not too bad overall."", ""Im surprised many are saying it has not longevity or projection. I get hours of this on my skin even after shower if I don't scrub off hard. It is very masculine as well while beach fresh and nightlife sexy. It is not feminine at all but possible worn by women. I get compliments of all ages and sexes. It becomes darker and creamier in warm weather and it becomes a rich sexy fresh magic scent in cold nights when out with the friends or ladies. This is a great fragrance that recall all at once a, woodsy forest like nature, with fresh sudsy soapy clean out of the shower feeling, rubbery-like fixing a flat tire on a new car in a new suit handsome gentlemen and a sunny beachy sexy island after a long tan on the sands and ready for the nightlife. take a deep whiff and imagine all that rolled into one."", ""A great creamy fig based scent. I wish it had a bit more projection power because it's a safe scent with a calmness to it. I had the chance to wear it for a majority of my summer, not yet for spring but I feel like it would be perfect for spring. Sweet fig, with a coconut scent to it, unique to my nose at least. Also, with 4.2 oz I spray this 5 times on me because of the weak projection and there's so much juice to be used."", 'I can imagine that some people like it but for me this is not a men fragrance.

I thought so too initially, but Ive had people comment on it at the end of the day after I applied it in the morning. There is something about this one I like. Its perfect for an office environment or a lazy sunday afternoon. Its refined and not over powering. It may be slightly too sweet for some, but for a fruity sweet scent it def smells like a man's cologne, and not unisex at all.

Opening with a lovely fruity citrus and cardamom I was happy enough but then it reveals a fig based fragrance which is sweet and creamy probably due to the combination with Tonka bean.

Trumpers Coconut shaving cream). The scent seems to pass quickly yet compliments still come many hours later in the day...

Why are there so many of these glutting up the market?"", ""Marc Jacobs for Men is a soft, thoughtful fragrance. It is comforting but still fashionable. It feels silky and a little buttery. It has a tropical essence but in general I think it's just very appealing and alluring. None of the notes are loud or bold in any way. I am very surprised to see people say that it is boring, because I think it was actually an edgy statement to release this as a masculine fragrance, especially a self-titled one.  Just to put it out there, the bottle is awful. It looks like a paperweight you'd find on the desk of a used car salesman during the late 80s. The bottle is very wide and flat with the atomizer placed directly in the center, which makes it awkward to press down with your finger while your hand is holding the bottle. It feels as though you could drop it easily. You may even have to use both hands with the larger size bottle, which is an absolutely glaring design flaw.  I greatly appreciate that Marc Jacobs for Men is relatively inexpensive compared to similar designer fragrances when you consider the price per ounce. Even though I love the way it smells, I will definitely pass on a purchase, because the projection is extremely soft, to a degree that's unacceptable for me. I say this completely without hyperbole: it has probably the worst sillage of any fragrance I've tried. My final verdict is that Marc Jacobs for Men is a wonderful scent with dreadful performance and a terrible bottle."", ""BEAUTIFUL! sprayed this on my wrist right now. and it just takes me to an island paradise. white sand and the blue ocean in front of me. eating macadamia nuts and got coconut juice on my right. no other person on my sight. just me and my perfect beach vacation. honestly i don't care about longevity or projection 'coz then i'll just spray more. besides this for me is a scent to be enjoyed by myself."", ""A great fragrance if you don't mind the fact that it smells like so many others in the genre.

If you have never smelled scents like Guerlain Homme or Prada Luna Rossa (which this also bears some semblence to), and you enjoy a pleasant, lime-infused, smooth, safe, rather generic, citrus affair, then perhaps this fragrance is for you.

Wont purchase ever again and this is my second bottle.', ""I agree with what's been said: a really lovely, powdery blend of fig and coconut with neither note dominating the other. It smells wonderful but has horrendous longevity and next to no projection. If it wasn't so pricey, I'd suggest it more as a body spray than a fragrance.

It's soft Like Fico but has a creamy coconut accord and gentle woods which set it apart in my opinion. Longevity is okay but not great and it doesn't really project all that much but smells great and the bottle is cool!"", 'I have been wearing this off and on for a while now and I have to say I really like this. I too wondered about it not lasting but I have found that if I just give one more spray the lasting effect is just fine at about 6 hours or more for me. I simply don\'t smell coconut like other people have mentioned, but what I do get is a very nice waxy floral that reminds me most of gardenias. Perhaps the coconut smell people get or the gardenia smell I get is the fig. I love the smell of gardenia and the ""heavy"" waxy smell really says summer to me. (EDIT: This aroma has to be the fig.) Too bad about the reviews here because this is an unique smell and I quite like it. Could become a signature scent for me. On second thought, I am glad for the somewhat negative reviews here...that means not everyone will be trying this. If it were more popular I don\'t think I would like this as much but since nobody seems to wear this, I LOVE IT! As one last note, it is no wonder this unique aroma won a FIFI award in 2003. There is nothing quite like it that I have smelled. You must smell this one if you want something that is not ordinary.', 'I enjoyed this ,it smells like milky coconut,but the longevity is substandard. Perhaps if it came in a smaller bottle i would buy a little but not a big bottle. You could get a similar effect with coco butter lotion I feel that this is unisex as with most gourmands.', ""Very mildly coconut or woody. It's hard to tell because this is so timid.  It's boring, has no longevity at all (it's gone on me within an hour) and no sillage. To quote Luca Turin about another fragrance, about the most you can say for this is that it has a smell. Why are there so many of these glutting up the market?"", ""I was working event for COTY, who now owns Marc Jacobs, Vera Wang, and Calvin Klein perfumes among others after they bought Procter & Gamble fragrance division, and it was given me as a present. On opening it smells like a hair spray. Later it smells like all mainstream perfumes, both male and female, were mixed in one giant barrel, and then watered down in half.  Totally faceless uninspiring perfume.  I can only see me wearing this if I'll go shopping in Walmart, which I do no more often than once in 2-3 years. I guess it would make it a gift of a lifetime? LOL Scent: 3 out of 10 Longevity: 5 of 10 Projection: 4 of 10 Silage: 4 of 10 EDIT: Ok, after giving it few more tries, it is little bit better than I originally thought. I can give it 5 out of 10 for scent. I could also wear it when going grocery shopping, not only to Walmart."", 'A very unusually scent. Some people may like it, but I smell like a tree when wearing Marc Jacobs Men. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I care about the environment, but this... I can imagine people pointing at me and saying ‚ÄúHey there goes that dude that smells like a tree.... Yeah and I heard he gets a little too close to the plants if you know what I mean.... Hey tree dude! Why don‚Äôt you make like a tree and leave?‚Äù I just can‚Äôt dig the fig. I just can‚Äôt dig it.', 'and yes. i have to agree on this one, it\'s GREEN ! imagine yourself walking in the fig garden, with fresh cut coconut in your hands, that\'s how i can visualize this scent through words. Scent : erm 6 out of 10 (its way tooo ""green"" for me. and yes i can see myself as a ""walking tree"") lol, but its not that bad. maybe its good for summer night out, something casual? not really. its better worn outside i think. Longevity : Moderate, got 3-4 hours on my skin. 6.5 out of 10 Projection : Soft. and im glad for that. if this were Beast. damn. what will they say? A GIANT TREE CHOKING THEIR NECK? lol. overall : Try before you buy']"

I\'ve seen no one else mention this so it must just be peculiar to me alone: a warm animalic note after drydown comes forth on my skin; not raunchy by any means, more akin to a well-loved leather jacket warmed by the sun.

I decided to put it on the shelf and all but forgot about it up until a about a week ago. Since it became warm, I have been wearing out Tommy Bahama's welcome. So I decided to go back and retry this scent. When I did my first re-sniff, I was shocked! What I could not smell in the fall when I got it was there now. There's a freshness that reminds me of Acqua di Gio and the beginning and then a softness that I'm currently unfamiliar with. Then, I get a feeling that reminds me of eating orange hard candy. I now rub this into my beard after a hot shower and it stays all day and sometimes even through the night. I am glad that I can now see what everyone was on about when they talked about it."", ""I'm a total fan of Royall Fragrances, except for their Mandarin. While other reviews have noted the scent as possessing an orange or a mandarin scent, I find no such scent factor evident in this Royall Fragrances offering.  First of all, the scent of a fruit used in a fragrance is not derived from the fruit portion of the fruit itself but from the peels. I am a formulary aromatherapist who has a large inventory of pure essential oils from all over the world. One of those is pure essential oil of mandarin. I know what mandarin's aroma qualities are and have used it in a number of blends I've formulated, and know how it complexifies with other essences. Somehow, Royall Fragrances missed it on this one. This scent is more of an off-scent with strong amber notes that strongly overwhelm an expected light top note experience, where the mandarin scent should be most present, but is not. I believe many claim to smell the mandarin scent simply because they don't know what actual neat (i.e. pure) mandarin scent really smells like, and so because this scent is so different from the signature quality of Royall Fragrances other scents, of which lime, bay, vitiver and musk are well known by the general public at large, a scent, that's supposed to come from the peel of mandarin, is not so well known, hence the tendency to believe it's mandarin, when in fact its not. A sort of suggestibility factor at work here more than an actual experiencing of the real mandarin essential oil itself. I love Royall Fragrances Lyme, Bay and Vitiver fragrances (their Musk doesn't set well with me or my skin type, but it's a great 'real' musk scent all the same) and my fragrance cache has all of them, in 8 oz sizes no less, but their Mandarin fragrance I have relegated to only a visual presence in my collection as the striking orange bottle is quite unique and pretty, but the scent leaves something to be desired otherwise, as it's not a citrus-based scent in any sense of the word or meaning."", 'When my 7 year old wants to put on one of my colognes, I put a few drops of this on him', ""Again, I tried this at Whole Foods Market. It's super simple but effective as All Purpose Lotion literally. It's juicy and clean orange scent. It's not sticky nor sugary. Just clean and refreshing orange.

This opens with the inevitable citrus melange so common in the so-called generic scents found in drugstores and bargain bins; however, this also has some tart currants, sweet-sour pineapple and smooth melon to give those citruses a run for their money. The addition of mint and lavender gives it a smoothness not usually found in overly citrusy scents and adds some body to the fruitiness. Along with the clean lavender there are violet, geranium and jasmine. (What doesn\'t have jasmine these days?) These add a cool, but slightly sharp, floral edge to it without sacraficing any of its masculinity. The drydown is your typical SAM formula with some dry green vetiver sprinkled in.

This one is interesting. Right away, I\'m hit with a dose of artificial apple; it\'s not the most unpleasantly cloying fake apple I\'ve ever smelled, but it\'s the main note of the opening. If you don\'t mind apple notes, rejoice! If you are wary of fruity notes, beware: this one is fruity. The apple is tempered by the citrus sparkle of bergamot and lime, with just a tiny touch of white floral flair, making it a bit more palatable than your run-of-the-mill children\'s hair detangler scent (I\'m looking at you, Light Blue by Dolce and Gabbana). You whiff past the apple accord, and you realize that something in here... stinks? My first guess was a particularly repugnant strain of patchouli, but, while it DOES have an earthy patchouli edge, that\'s not quite it. It\'s a distinctly bitter note, the kind of smell you keep breathing in even though you\'re not sure whether you like it, like gasoline or Expo markers... It\'s teak wood! Wow, what a note. ""Blond"" doesn\'t quite describe it here; this teak is a little darker and heavier, covered in a distinct sheen of oil. It kind of reeks a tiny bit, but... in a good way? How many true bitter notes do you smell every day, after all, especially in today\'s generic department store fragrances, designed for focus groups? It\'s really fascinating for sure, and I agree this is lost on the TJMaxx crowd on the hunt for an agreeable fragrance. This is the odd bitterness in the air at a small, old library. It is a touch of that burning rubber, gasoline sort of smell that so many people claim to love. And, quite honestly, it\'s not all that prominent; the reeking teak note makes its presence known, but stays stubbornly hidden away behind the fruity and floral nuances through the entire development of this fragrance. After just ten minutes or so, the fruity top evaporates off, leaving the patchouli-edged teak and rose heart of the fragrance exposed. The rose is actually not too bad! I think that teak whisper, along with some remaining top fruitiness, balances it out and keeps it from getting too soapy. I keep taking whiffs to get more of that teak wood; I think I\'ve quickly become anosmic to it, as I\'m not getting much of it after another few minutes, but I hope it will come back. This is well-blended, inspired, and interesting. It\'s a touch nichey, while still clinging to a typical fruitchouli male fragrance accord that\'s a little eye-roll-inducing, but well executed. I might have to hold onto this and try it a few more times to really understand it.', 'I\'ve had this for awhile and could never figure out if I liked it or I hated it. I still don\'t know. This has a sour bitter aspect to the scent. It\'s fresh and bright, but not in a typical way. But not in an ""artistic boundary pushing"" way either. I\'m not an expert at picking out notes, but I think it\'s the neroli and teak wood that gives it this weird bitter sting. Everytime I wear it I think to myself ""today I\'ll decide if I get rid of this"". But then end up not being able to decide. I don\'t know. Purchase at your own risk.', 'Blind buy, first thing noticed in the opening is that teak wood, and really I should be writing ""TEAK WOOD"" in full caps because it\'s turned up to ten!  It has been described as ""burnt plastic"" or ""burnt rubber"", although to my nose it\'s more along the lines of what I could imagine the fumes from a piece of tree bark being dissolved by a powerful acid would smell like, with a bit of ""new car smell"" thrown in for good measure.  I wouldn\'t say it is pleasant, more like when one smells petrol (gasoline to my American cousins) or a whiteboard marker, you\'re not exactly enjoying it but you find your nose unconsciously searching for it in the air. If it would just dial itself back to a one or two for the drydown it would be acceptable, but sadly it doesn\'t, remaining overdone and demanding your attention for the life of the wear.  This unfortunately isn\'t the only problem the fragrance has, critically I cannot see many scenarios this type fits - it\'s too formal for relaxed wear, too polarising and not enough of a ""people pleaser"" for the office or dealing with public, not ""sexy"" enough for clubbing and the late night and not refined enough for date night.  When you add the fact that it\'s neither a youthful scent or a mature one, lurking somewhere in between, it really doesn\'t fit in anywhere, and I can\'t envisage a day or time where I\'ll be thinking ""Perry Man will suit this perfectly"", there will always be another fragrance I reach for first.  This bottle is facing a cold and unloved future...', 'You will notice a lot of negative reviews in here...mostly due to the fact that this has probably been sold to the wrong crowd. The brand and the price target the type of shoppers that may expect a crowdpleaser; which this is definitely not. This is a niche fragrance at a fraction of the price. This comes much closer to smell like a Serge Lutens than a Calvin Klein; and that\'s why you\'ll see many negative reactions here. It is mostly sold in shopping malls and TJMAXXes and it sit right next to Obsession - it\'s a easy reach for the demographics that are looking for an alternative to Calvin Klein. Wrong crowd!  The fragrance, it\'s not easy to identify and it\'s not easy to like right away. You have to get to know it before you start enjoying it. To me, it seems to be working better in warmer weather. It\'s a non-linear Neroli/Patchouli/Teak fragrance, with Teak wood being one of the most dominant and recognizable note. Note: Teak Wood is what people refer to as ""burnt rubber"" and it can be a sour note - if you have been raised in mid-century houses with lots of teak around OR you are used to hang around old libraries you will recognise the ""oiled wood"" smell right away.  People who are used to Ferrari Bright Neroli, may dismiss Perry Ellis Man for having a ""gone off"" quality to it. Some people literally think it has gone off. BUT if you are used to Serge Lutens Feurs D\'Oranger which has a distinct civet note, you\'ll find Perry Ellis Man quite interesting and definitely a cheapy addition to keep in your collection.', 'Its ok for the price point lol i got mine in a trade i wouldnt recommend this unless youre just trying to add to your collection for fun', 'Dupe for Desire for man, Dunhill and a cheaper version of Fracas for men.', ""I didn't care a lot for this fragrance at first, but the more I wear it, the more I love it!!

I bought this by accident because I thought it was Perry Ellis M and realized it was Man. Probably the worst $15 I‚Äôve ever spent. This shouldn‚Äôt be in production anymore. It should be banned from stores and burned.', 'Remains me a lot Ed Hardy love & Luck whit out the rose note obviously!!! .', ""This one is different. In the beginning it smells of a sour Rose/Musk/Patchouli. You can definitely smell the Rose in this scent(if you have the real bottle, and not a fake). It is somewhat sweeter on the drydown, but not in a sugar kind of way. Perry Ellis always makes quality scents, but this one is probably in the middle or towards the lower end of all of Perry's scents. This is definitely not unisex. This one with the use of Rose was way ahead of it's time. It was released in 2002,  If you like Heavy, or classic 1970's-80's scents, you may not like this because of the mix of Rose, Musk, Patchouli and Citrus. It doesn't smell synthetic at all, but with Rose and Citrus, I can tell how this scent mix might make some feel its a bit feminine. Smells good 3-4 hours after spraying it on your skin.  Beware though, there are SO MANY FAKES of this scent on Amazon/Ebay now, people selling testers on Ebay and Amazon, if you get the real thing, this truly is a unique scent. My 3rd bottle which was a tester, I bought from Ebay April 2017 is clearly expired or a fake. It smells of mainly Musk, rubbing alcohol, with a light artificial sweet smell in the background but mostly smells bitter. It's not smooth, with the sweetness coming a few second later and well balanced like the real version is.  This product has been discontinued so I would think some of these bad reviews on Fragrantica are from people buying fakes of this.

When I looked at the listed notes, I thought that this would likely smell similar to Dunhill's Desire for a Man, but I get little rose or patchouli here, unlike in Desire. I also don't get distinct teak wood, though it definitely has a woody quality after a while. Perry Man begins smooth and creamy, unlike Desire's opening. It's reasonably natural smelling and certainly not super-sweet, but it's not especially compelling in any way either. Over time it gets woodier and drier, which I find even less interesting, probably because the base notes are not of high quality (unlike the wood note in vintage Acteur, for example). Also, it seems like there is more than a tiny amount of iso e super in here, in case you are sensitive to it."", 'After a quick spritz, it was a bit bitter at first and quickly became fresh citrusy sweet. Nothing good, nothing bad here. Then I could smell rose and patchouli and something woody, and I really liked this combo. The scent was slightly powdery, slightly sweet all around with a typical musk at the end. The base was really nice as well; clean and fresh.

Right away, I\'m hit with a dose of artificial apple; it\'s not the most unpleasantly cloying fake apple I\'ve ever smelled, but it\'s the main note of the opening. If you don\'t mind apple notes, rejoice! If you are wary of fruity notes, beware: this one is fruity. The apple is tempered by the citrus sparkle of bergamot and lime, with just a tiny touch of white floral flair, making it a bit more palatable than your run-of-the-mill children\'s hair detangler scent (I\'m looking at you, Light Blue by Dolce and Gabbana). You whiff past the apple accord, and you realize that something in here... stinks? My first guess was a particularly repugnant strain of patchouli, but, while it DOES have an earthy patchouli edge, that\'s not quite it. It\'s a distinctly bitter note, the kind of smell you keep breathing in even though you\'re not sure whether you like it, like gasoline or Expo markers... It\'s teak wood! Wow, what a note. ""Blond"" doesn\'t quite describe it here; this teak is a little darker and heavier, covered in a distinct sheen of oil. It kind of reeks a tiny bit, but... in a good way? How many true bitter notes do you smell every day, after all, especially in today\'s generic department store fragrances, designed for focus groups? It\'s really fascinating for sure, and I agree this is lost on the TJMaxx crowd on the hunt for an agreeable fragrance. This is the odd bitterness in the air at a small, old library. It is a touch of that burning rubber, gasoline sort of smell that so many people claim to love. And, quite honestly, it\'s not all that prominent; the reeking teak note makes its presence known, but stays stubbornly hidden away behind the fruity and floral nuances through the entire development of this fragrance. After just ten minutes or so, the fruity top evaporates off, leaving the patchouli-edged teak and rose heart of the fragrance exposed. The rose is actually not too bad! I think that teak whisper, along with some remaining top fruitiness, balances it out and keeps it from getting too soapy. I keep taking whiffs to get more of that teak wood; I think I\'ve quickly become anosmic to it, as I\'m not getting much of it after another few minutes, but I hope it will come back. This is well-blended, inspired, and interesting. It\'s a touch nichey, while still clinging to a typical fruitchouli male fragrance accord that\'s a little eye-roll-inducing, but well executed. I might have to hold onto this and try it a few more times to really understand it.', 'Sometimes you purchase a ""cheapie"" fragrance in hopes of finding a hidden gem or something that is more or deeper than its price would lead you to believe.

It has been described as ""burnt plastic"" or ""burnt rubber"", although to my nose it\'s more along the lines of what I could imagine the fumes from a piece of tree bark being dissolved by a powerful acid would smell like, with a bit of ""new car smell"" thrown in for good measure.  I wouldn\'t say it is pleasant, more like when one smells petrol (gasoline to my American cousins) or a whiteboard marker, you\'re not exactly enjoying it but you find your nose unconsciously searching for it in the air. If it would just dial itself back to a one or two for the drydown it would be acceptable, but sadly it doesn\'t, remaining overdone and demanding your attention for the life of the wear.  This unfortunately isn\'t the only problem the fragrance has, critically I cannot see many scenarios this type fits - it\'s too formal for relaxed wear, too polarising and not enough of a ""people pleaser"" for the office or dealing with public, not ""sexy"" enough for clubbing and the late night and not refined enough for date night.  When you add the fact that it\'s neither a youthful scent or a mature one, lurking somewhere in between, it really doesn\'t fit in anywhere, and I can\'t envisage a day or time where I\'ll be thinking ""Perry Man will suit this perfectly"", there will always be another fragrance I reach for first.

Wal-Mart demands that their suppliers give them the cheapest prices on everything and as such the quality of their merchandise suffers. Its almost like you just know the cut roses that come into Wal-Marts are 2 days older than the ones the florists get, and then after they do not sell for a couple of days Wal-Mart marks them down and tries to move them fast. You buy roses from Wal-Mart and you get the last 2 days of wilted enjoyment from them rather than the crisp enjoyment when you buy a fresh bouquet. The scent is a chemical mess. I have praised the synthetic achievement of Tea Rose. Immense is synthetic done badly. I do think this is a mostly rose fragrance but you can smell the violet and pepper. The pepper is nice but the blend and mix is awful and overshadowed by a chemical travesty. As the ruinous chemical opening dries down the rose comes out a bit more and has a weak wilted rosy drydown. Performance and sillage are both awful. This is a skin scent from the opening and performance struggles to last 4 hours. My usage patterns of it is light. Occasionally, perhaps once a month, I will use it about 2 hours before bed. I get a brief light rose scent that relaxes me right about when Im ready for sleep. The drydown is slightly passably relaxing and brief. Mostly, I wear it when Im really dirty and smelly anyway just to cover up some stench and get value from the product. Its so bad, that I use it as disinfectant for cuts. Needless to say a backup bottle is out of the question. Value is awful. I bought this on clearance. The bottle is nice and has a skyscraper thing going on and is the best thing about the scent. Regardless of price there is no value in an awful scent. I bought this from one of my most trusted fragrance retailers and a guy who sells Creed in his shop. He spoke of it kindly and was glad to sell it but it was a failure of a purchase even while discounted. You can go wrong in even the highest end of shops. But make no mistake, this is barely worthy of a Wal-Mart triple red sticker clearance red light special blowout. I will rate this at 55 and place it in an F and Fail category. There have been others on Fragrantica who compared this to GIT and it is not. Sometimes a bargain scent is not a good idea. I love the bottle and initial presentation and I did not pay much for this product. But when I got home, I realized that the only value was the beautiful bottle and the end of life drydown that was oh so brief. Its possible that I bought an old bottle with compromised juice but the horrible opening suggests that this is not the case. When you go to Wal-Mart it is easy to buy things that you regret. I think we all have done it. That clearance bin movie that was not so good or the vacuum cleaner that broke the day after the warranty expired. You can get a little bit of enjoyment from Immense if you try. But you have to try and you have to look for the good in things to do it. The bottle is nice. You have a very brief 1-2 hour window of subpar wilted rosy drydown that is relaxing and a little bit of pepper spice to distract you from an awful opening. But this fragrance has no value to any but serious collectors who want to try a new house and who like the bottle. This is the kind of thing that you buy when you know there is going to be a fight when you get home and the roses are going to be thrown on the ground and stomped on but you want to show that you tried. The taint of Wal-Mart is already in the wilt.', ""Another take on the Green Irish Tweed type idea, which also includes Stardust for Men. This one seems to have some calone along with dihydromyrcenol, making it quite strong but not so great if you aren't a fan of obvious calone (I'm not). Note that I just sprayed it on a card and then decided that it might not be agreeable. Moreover, I've got Stardust and prefer it to the others of this type. I also have Corinto Rouge, which is like a simplified and more wearable Cool Water, though I think there are more significant differences between CW and GIT. I just mentioned CR because it too has quite a bit of dihydromyrcenol, but not calone, and it's sweet/powdery like CW (but not like GIT in that respect). Anyway, to sum it up, I think Immense will be enjoyed by those who would like a variation on the GIT theme and don't mind or even want some noticeable calone."", 'I admire Raphael Haury. He makes fresh, clean and pleasant perfume. Not the kind of sharp, ozonic like orthers. Really love this one', ""A friend of mine used to use this.I really like it-it's not a typical aquatic men fragrance.The pink pepper makes it interesting and provoking."", 'Continuing in our rose series for Valentines day, Immense Pour Homme by Jean-Louise Scherrer is a Wal-Mart clearance rose. Wal-Mart demands that their suppliers give them the cheapest prices on everything and as such the quality of their merchandise suffers. Its almost like you just know the cut roses that come into Wal-Marts are 2 days older than the ones the florists get, and then after they do not sell for a couple of days Wal-Mart marks them down and tries to move them fast. You buy roses from Wal-Mart and you get the last 2 days of wilted enjoyment from them rather than the crisp enjoyment when you buy a fresh bouquet. The scent is a chemical mess. I have praised the synthetic achievement of Tea Rose. Immense is synthetic done badly. I do think this is a mostly rose fragrance but you can smell the violet and pepper. The pepper is nice but the blend and mix is awful and overshadowed by a chemical travesty. As the ruinous chemical opening dries down the rose comes out a bit more and has a weak wilted rosy drydown. Performance and sillage are both awful. This is a skin scent from the opening and performance struggles to last 4 hours. My usage patterns of it is light. Occasionally, perhaps once a month, I will use it about 2 hours before bed. I get a brief light rose scent that relaxes me right about when Im ready for sleep. The drydown is slightly passably relaxing and brief. Mostly, I wear it when Im really dirty and smelly anyway just to cover up some stench and get value from the product. Its so bad, that I use it as disinfectant for cuts. Needless to say a backup bottle is out of the question. Value is awful. I bought this on clearance. The bottle is nice and has a skyscraper thing going on and is the best thing about the scent. Regardless of price there is no value in an awful scent. I bought this from one of my most trusted fragrance retailers and a guy who sells Creed in his shop. He spoke of it kindly and was glad to sell it but it was a failure of a purchase even while discounted. You can go wrong in even the highest end of shops. But make no mistake, this is barely worthy of a Wal-Mart triple red sticker clearance red light special blowout. I will rate this at 55 and place it in an F and Fail category. There have been others on Fragrantica who compared this to GIT and it is not. Sometimes a bargain scent is not a good idea. I love the bottle and initial presentation and I did not pay much for this product. But when I got home, I realized that the only value was the beautiful bottle and the end of life drydown that was oh so brief. Its possible that I bought an old bottle with compromised juice but the horrible opening suggests that this is not the case. When you go to Wal-Mart it is easy to buy things that you regret. I think we all have done it. That clearance bin movie that was not so good or the vacuum cleaner that broke the day after the warranty expired. You can get a little bit of enjoyment from Immense if you try. But you have to try and you have to look for the good in things to do it. The bottle is nice. You have a very brief 1-2 hour window of subpar wilted rosy drydown that is relaxing and a little bit of pepper spice to distract you from an awful opening. But this fragrance has no value to any but serious collectors who want to try a new house and who like the bottle. This is the kind of thing that you buy when you know there is going to be a fight when you get home and the roses are going to be thrown on the ground and stomped on but you want to show that you tried.

Lingering very nicely and showing nice touches of the original but being more soft and summery. Very nice and sophisticated indeed!!', 'Its Samourai for the younger aged! Less character then the original yet a nice, fresh scent for casual occasions as it radiates an easy going feeling. Its not in the same range with those unbelievable AD Fragrances like Plus, Iquitos or even Samourai original, but still a very tastefully done happy scent in its own right! Top notes are happy fresh and fruity while the mid notes and dry down strongly remind me of Puma Create which is a very underrated, nice fragrance. So in general tumbs up again for Monsieur Delon!', ""In comparing the notes with Samourai, it seems this one is a more complex version. I haven't smelled Samourai before, but I got the EDT of 47 in a lot of fragrances today because I wanted the women's fragrance in the lot. And this one is the first I selected to wear because it had me at the first sniff! I can certainly understand how it has acquired it's admirers. This is such a nice *UNISEX-ABLE* impressive find, & a lot better than some of celeb fragrances out there. Even tho it looks to be dc now, there is still a good bit of it on ebay so if this is your signature, you might want to stock up on it. If folks ever realize what a super deal it is for the money, it might quickly get gone! It certainly smells of quality ingedients, gives me the impression of a self-assured cosmopolitan bold enough to do the unexpected that disarms & draws one in, then morphs into it's somewhat linear base notes that just seem to hold you captive until it is through showing the strength, worthiness & character of it's tenacity & intoxication. It is strong, a gorgeous creation suitable for either sex.  The top notes are stupendous in the opening! Just the tiniest dab on the inside of both wrists & as I watch it dry on my skin, I can't stop smelling my wrists! The opening is just PERFECTION! Actually, the top notes that open this spellbinding gem are my favorite aspect of it. It is bold with the ever bright, sunny lemon with it's tartness! This lemony phase is perfection & I wish it held that opening effervenscense throughout it's embrace, or maybe just longer! But for those that are not that fond of lemon or citruses take heart, as that opening act is quickly over. Tarragon is a teasing herbal ghost in the initial opening & it adds a nice, unexpected note with it's fast flash of what smells like dried anise but that darts past quickly in herbal green leaving me wanting more. It's as if the tarragon is hiding, waiting for the warmth of the skin to release it, & the instant it does, it burst out of hiding so quickly seasoning the opening lemon. It brings such a fascinating soft herbal quality momentarily, but, for me it is a phantom. Just as quickly as I realized it, it was gone leaving anisic trail momentarily suspended with lemon & lavender awakening. I never realized I would love tarragon in a scent like this, but I am a believer now! This opening is bright, sparkling, clean, refreshing, with a slight sweet-tart crisp lemon to clarify the palette, wake-up the olfactory senses & cleanse them with it's promise of brilliance. But alas, once it has done it's job by sending the sunny brightness of clear delectable & tart lemon to cleanse, stimulate & prepare for Act II, it is all too soon quiet now for the next scene. Ah, the gorgeous lavendar, jasmine, delicious plum & powdery rose to all come to play & work their magic in the forefront of the stage for Act II. Each is in perfect balance---the plum, a surprise but blending so well with the somewhat soapy floral lavender. And all the while the smokey, smoldering sweet aromas of the base notes providing a solid foundation for all but remaining in the background while the others perform impeccably. It is during this phase that it seems somewhat feminine to me. It still has a light bergamot & plum fruit lingering just lightly as it's really tenacious strength is about to unveil it's true muscle.  WOW!!! the beauty of the balmy woods, vanilla, musk & amber. The cedar is even still lightly detectable after 7 hours along with sweet woods, vetiver, vanilla & amber that smoulders sweetly.

I could swear that master perfumer Guy Robert (Caleche, Equipage, Gucci Pour Homme Original) or one of his disciples had their hand at composing it, as it has something similar to his woody, spicy, clean core.

It‚Äôs clean, non-intrusive, and extremely wearable. It's lemon done right without smelling like household cleaner or synthetic toilet spray. The more I explore fragrances, the more I find myself enjoying these cheapie options over some designer, niche, or indie scents. And it makes sense. They‚Äôre designed to be inoffensive and universally appealing. Fierce is no exception. It projects like a beast out of the gate. Unfortunately, the EDC concentration means longevity is where it completely fails. After about an hour, it noticeably begins to fade, which is a shame given how good it smells upfront. If this were re-released as a parfum, it‚Äôd be an easy buy in my book. It‚Äôs still one of the most balanced citrus scents I‚Äôve come across: not sharp, not sour, not overpowering.

Maybe my opinion on this scent is not biased because I never entered A&F store in my life I don\'t have the ""nostalgic"" memory associated with this perfume.

It is very young, clean and dynamic. It makes me feel very positive when I wear it. It has a delicious musk-based, aromatic and woody DNA. The fir note in it is in great harmony with the musk.  I don't know if it is because of the compliments I get from outside, I started to think that it is a very perfect scent.

Better in my opinion than Creed Aventus, which the House of Creed has definitely reformulated and destroyed. It's sweet, but not too sweet. Musky but not to the point of animalic. Woody but not too woody or green.

Very similar to two I already own: Legend EdP and Skulls & Roses for Men. Being a cologne, the performance is on the weaker side. My recommendation would be to go for Legend EdP which is stronger and longer lasting or Skulls & Roses which has slightly better performance and a much more entertaining bottle, all for a lower price."", ""I really like this one.

It's one of a few scents where it smells one way when you're breathing in, and it smells different when you're exhaling, so it's got complexity. Something else I appreciate about this is, is that it knows what it is and is not afraid to stand out. I think there are several colognes that are just trying to be well blended and not stand out too much. This is just so memorable with its sweetness and musk.

What I always found interesting about Fierce is that despite all the notes listed, I couldn't pinpoint a few notes, it's just overall musky to me. But that's what I like about this scent, every collection needs a safe dumb-reach that you know will make you smell clean, you won't offend anyone with this and it will go with any casual outfit so for that alone, it makes it worthy.

I thought this scent would be a home run for me, but it goes to show you should always try the cologne on yourself, not a test strip if possible. Overall, 3/5, with one star removed for personal taste and the other for short longevity. I recommend for casual summer and fall evenings (not a work or formal scent).

Anchor Blue (the original for men) was one. It's really fresh, kind of astringent, SUPER musky (clean musk though), and herbaceous in a really light manner, not heavily herbal or barbershop-y. Extremely fresh, and the florals here don't play much of a role. I could be biased of course (especially when it pertains to this frag), but this smells very decidedly masculine (who cares though, wear what you like).  The thing is though...I always thought this smelled salty back in the 2000s, and I smell a lot of salt now as well. It's a very clean sort of salt, and it combines with the musk to create a super *white&fresh* effect. Though, the base notes (the vetiver isn't natural smelling) also serve to keep this a warm temperatured fragrance, and somehow quite inviting in an oddly compelling way.

The old one might have been a little better smelling, better performing, but don't bother buying pre-2011 batches. It is a huge waste of money and time. This stuff overperforms as it is, and people complaining about bad performance are nose-deaf. Women are obsessed with this scent, and it doesn't matter how old you are within reason. Everyone should own this and give it the occasional try as their nose develops, because it WILL change for you, and it is probably the most mass-appealing fragrance for men. I've bought and sold it a few times, but finally keeping it for good, because I understand how to wear it without it being too piercing, and it is by far the best execution of this DNA that there is. If you can, get on ebay and buy as many bottles of Fierce Intense as you can, because it is a steal at 50USD (idgaf that it was 15USD two years ago. Those bottles were leaky a lot of the time and the past is gone, my friend) and it is only going to get more expensive, because the scent character there is irreplaceable. They are different enough to more than justify owning both, and they are both utter and absolute masterpieces that have not been properly replicated to my knowledge, though many have tried. The most popular is Percival, and it is close, but it is very noticeably more powdery and floral and not as masculine or generally pleasing at all, in my opinion. I have the supposedly stronger 78%alc. batch, and it performs, but it is not a proper replacement for Fierce in its scent character. A big reason why old Fierce was so good in profile and performance was because the majority of the aroma molecules were iso E super, so just get some of that and spray them on together. They do go well together. My main point is that this fragrance is ludicrously underrated because most people into fragrances (representing a tiny minority of all people) think it has a bad rep because of Abercrombie, malls, and douche bags who oversprayed it 20 years ago. Don't let that get to you, because if you just don't overspray and don't be a douche bag, you too can enjoy maybe the best fresh fragrance for men that you can buy.

Yeah performance is pretty bad due to it being an eau de cologne, but I only wear this during spring when I go skating so I don't need it to last a long time at all.

I don‚Äôt wear it as often anymore, but when I do, it‚Äôs with a great pleasure. I find this fragrance to be timeless and not dated at all.

Spoiler alert: It‚Äôs Fierce, and it‚Äôs about to make you feel like a high school heartthrob, whether you‚Äôre in the mood or not. The Scent Imagine you‚Äôve just walked into the Abercrombie store at the height of its popularity, and the scent is so strong it could be considered a form of chemical warfare. That‚Äôs Fierce. The bottle itself is about as subtle as a neon sign in a blackout. It‚Äôs a straightforward glass rectangle with a little metal plaque that screams, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here, and I‚Äôm ready to party.‚Äù Fierce opens with a burst of citrus and herbal notes that smack you in the face like a group of rowdy teenagers shouting, ‚ÄúYOLO!‚Äù You‚Äôve got a mix of lemon, lime, and a dash of sea breeze, making you feel like you‚Äôve just been tossed into a pool party without the water.

Finally, the base notes of sandalwood, musk, and oakmoss come through like a warm, yet slightly aggressive hug. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôve spent the day flexing in the gym and getting in a few too many fist bumps. Longevity Fierce has the staying power of that one track on your playlist you can‚Äôt escape. It hangs around for a solid chunk of the day, neither disappearing after lunch nor overstaying its welcome. You‚Äôll find it lingering on your clothes and your soul, like a catchy but annoying tune that‚Äôs just too infectious to let go. It‚Äôs reliable, but not the kind of cologne that‚Äôs going to make you forget about it. Sillage This fragrance projects with the subtlety of a foghorn. It‚Äôs got a medium projection‚Äîenough to let people know you‚Äôve arrived without causing a stampede. It‚Äôs like being the life of the party without being the guy who tries too hard. You‚Äôll get noticed, but you won‚Äôt be so overwhelming that people start eyeing the exits. Uniqueness There‚Äôs no denying it: Fierce is as unique as a mixtape from a high school prom. It‚Äôs got a signature scent that you either love or find oddly familiar, like a favorite old TV show that you can‚Äôt quite put your finger on. It‚Äôs not groundbreaking, but it‚Äôs certainly memorable. If you‚Äôre looking for a fragrance that screams ‚ÄúAbercrombie,‚Äù you‚Äôve hit the jackpot.

For more formal events or quiet dinners, it might feel a bit out of place, like wearing a party hat to a board meeting. It‚Äôs best suited for when you want to project that youthful, energetic vibe. Final Thoughts Fierce is a fragrance that‚Äôs been the olfactory equivalent of high school pep rallies and college parties. It‚Äôs bold, assertive, and unapologetically youthful, with a mix of citrus, floral, and woodsy notes that make a statement.

In its opening it has citrus fruits and some aromatic elements, a little aquatic. As the minutes pass, you perceive a kind of lavender, sandalwood, musk and perhaps sage that give it the characteristic clean aroma that made it so popular.

Its longevity was a maximum of 5 hours. with an almost low sillage, very close to the skin to perceive its aroma. The aroma is still pleasant and attractive, however there are so many fragrances inspired by it, that probably only you will know that you bring Fierce, because I doubt that anyone would know if you brought any of its inspirations, which are sometimes cheaper, even so for the who have used it since it was launched, I am sure that they will prefer it over others, but for those who have not known it since then I only recommend buying it unless they find it at a good price, otherwise with one of the mentioned fragrances they will find a good alternative.', ""Great classic.

Well done."", 'Just got a new bottle with the current batch. I sprayed it on before bed and 6 hours later it‚Äôs still there unlike some other fragrances that are EDPs..this smells a million times better than Mont Blanc legend.

My scent preferences have skewed to the more niche, high-end and considerably more expensive in recent years, but there‚Äôs still nothing like a bottle of Fierce. The 2000s will never die, so long as this scent lives on. Just one gentle whiff of this (not that there is anything remotely gentle about this fragrance, as you can smell it a mile away ‚Äì and I mean that in the best possible way), and you‚Äôre instantly transported back to Abercrombie & Fitch in a 2000s era mall. Some say this has been reformulated to blandness but, no, it‚Äôs still all here. Pure nostalgia. Black and white images of shirtless toned men, and pumping techno music. Dragging your parents and their credits cards with you, while they are seated underneath a giant moose head and they suffer from stimulation overload, as you retreat to the fitting room to try on the very tightest and hottest pink polo you can find. Disclaimer: I worked for A&F and Hollister throughout college during the mid-00s, and I can recognize this scent immediately. Every now and then I‚Äôll pass a stranger on the street, and get a waft of Fierce. It‚Äôs unmistakable. And somehow not outdated. As always, it reeks of masculine collegiate sex. Any man wearing this will smell fresh, clean, youthful, and will make you do a double-take. Although I personally outgrew this scent years ago, I bought a bottle recently for old time‚Äôs sake. Occasionally I‚Äôll spritz it in my apartment or spray it on when I want to recapture my teenage self. One of my friends asked me in surprise, ‚ÄúAre you wearing‚Ä¶Fierce?,‚Äù and I replied ‚ÄúHell yes, I am.‚Äù ""It smells so good,‚Äù she laughed, as we both agreed that this scent has managed to stand the test of time and is still capable of activating hormones and testosterone.

I bought Mont Blanc Legend recently though and it reminded me of Fierce. Had good memories with Fierce."", ""I don't recall what note I loved in this frag but comparing with my other faves it could be the cardamom that melts down to oakmoss and musk.

You DO realize that Legend, which came out TEN years after Fierce WAS the copy of Fierce, right? I DO agree that the more reformulations this goes through, the less it resembles the original release. But I never give much credit to someone who\'s review consists of ""There\'s no WAY people ACTUALLY like this stuff as much as they SAY they do, I don\'t believe them!!"" I\'ll say this.. The only time I would go into Abercrombie stores at the mall back when they were at their peak, was at Christmas time. Usually to shop for the younger people on my list. And of course, they always sprayed the store with Fierce. My current bottle from 2015 still takes me right back to those busy Holiday evenings at the mall every time I wear it. So at least for me, it still definitely does the job.', ""I'm compelled to share my enthusiasm for this fragrance! Having tried both the clear and body-shaped bottles, I can attest that there's no discernible difference in scent. This fragrance has become my signature, with people often commenting that I don't smell like myself when I wear something else. I wholeheartedly recommend it, as it provides a full day of performance. Give it a try - I'm confident you'll love it!"", 'So I\'m going to be reviewing what Abercrombie labels ""The Vintage Edition"" on their website. This is the last formulation with the torso on the bottle that came out back in 2019, I believe. This is the one with the metal cap, not the black wooden cap. The old torso bottles had the black wooden cap. Now they have the clear bottles, which I cannot comment on because I haven\'t tried them. My batch is from 2019. To start, I have never smelled the older formulations, so I cannot comment on that also. However, I bet they were strong. Now, as for my 2019 Batch, the performance isn\'t bad to be honest. I get about 6hrs-7hrs of longevity and about 2hrs+ of decent Projection. If I\'m being honest, I really don\'t have a problem detecting the fragrance at all during those 6 to 7 hours. After that time period I have to bring my wrist to my nose to detect it, but even at that I can still smell a decent skin scent. The projection strength is average (it won\'t fill up a room) with the distance of it being arms length, which is fine for me. As for the scent, I love it. This is a classic scent that will always be nostalgic for many. This is the king of Mall Fragrances. When you think about the mall, there\'s no denying this Scent comes to mind. The scent is very nice and very appealing and will definitely not offend anyone. You can wear this to the office, when you\'re hanging out with friends, on casual days, or even use it as a signature Scent. This is definitely better than Mont Blanc Legend EDT in my opinion. Legend is frutier, whereas Fierce is citrusy. Either way this cologne is nice and definitely one of my favorites.', 'I‚Äôm not gunna bull shit and say this has amazing performance cuz it doesn‚Äôt. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as bad as some make out cuz I got two very nice compliments from people at work today and that was about 5 hours after I‚Äôd sprayed! I was very surprised others could smell it very easily as I didn‚Äôt hose myself down in it either, about 4 sprays. This may have been butchered by reformulations but it still smells amazing to my nose.', 'I love the idea from people who hate on this fragrance claim that it is generic with no backbone in being an influential scent. That cannot be further away from the truth. This is a fragrance that has proven to stand the test of time, released 20 years ago and still holding to this day. ""But only the younger crowd is wearing it"" as if that means there is no credibility in that.  it is also completely unfair that people think Abercrombie immediately means not worth the hype because it\'s not YSL or Dior or something... Judge a fragrance by the juice, not the brand. Fierce was once that TOP fragrance that every girl loved on their man, something that your favourite scent probably never did to a generation and I guarantee you it can be released to this day and perform well. You can still wear this today and pull compliments, I\'m sure of it. With regards to the reformulation comments, I can\'t really speak for it but I\'m always skeptical of reformulations drastically changing a scent. Why would a company just kill their line like that? Regardless, today\'s formulations still perform well and smell outstanding. My 2019 bottle served me well, too.

I remember getting this on ebay and being delighted. You'd constantly get outbid for a bottle, even the small sizes would sell for over 100 quid.

And it smells as good as it ever has. That out of the way... Fierce is a classic for a reason. As Drakkar Noir defined the 80s, and Acqua di Gio defined the 90s, so does Fierce define the 2000s. It\'s aromatic and manly, youthful and vibrant but predates the bubblegum sweetness trend. It\'s fresh without smelling like body wash or body spray.

The criticisms about performance are warranted, but some are a bit exaggerated. I spray this on around 6:30 in the morning and I still smell it on my wrists around 1. I\'d say it has roughly 2-3 hours of decent projection and then hangs out closer to the skin for about another 3-4 hours. I was talking with someone on Sunday about 4 hours after putting it on and they asked me what I was wearing, so it at least hung around that long. I don\'t want the overbearing-in-your-face performance of the old formulations, but it could definitely be better. Overall, I give this one a ""like"". The scent is amazing and the versatility is excellent. If the performance was a little bit better I would give it a ""love"". As it stands, you\'ll need to re-apply in the afternoon if you want it to carry you through the entire day.', 'This is memories in a bottle. Plain and simple. Such an amazing scent at the time but I still love wearing it when feeling nostalgic.', 'This scent is completely mythic. a heady and iconic smell that communicated a whole set of values, beauty, racial hierarchies, jealousies, fears, sex urges, time, death, love. I guess that white bergamot is the thing i held at such lofty heights of power', 'I want to know which fixatives can be used for Abercrombie and Fitch fierce for men perfume', 'Who says women can‚Äôt wear mens cologne? I was a freshman in high school when I started wearing Jovan Musk for Men. It lasted longer and it smelled good on me. Fierce by A & B is gorgeous on me! It is so good!!

They were so surprised.', ""If you guys are really enjoying this scent still in 2022 (which I love hearing), Abercrombie's website is selling it for 25-30% off right now, $67CAD for a 100ml !!!"", 'Great perfume , great performance , versatile and all year round .', ""This is nice to own if you grew up in that era of hanging out in the shopping malls and walking through Abercrombie and Fitch remembering that distinctive scent in the air. I look at it like Cool Water. Brings back a lot of memories.  Personally, If I want this style of scent, then PDMs Percival is Fierce but more modern with better longevity and quality. You'll pay $100 more for Percival but if you have the funds it's worth it IMO.  My issue with this is that Fierce is at roughly $100 price point (that is what I am finding in the US at least). The quality vs. cost equation isn't worth it to me. Percival on the other hand smells much better, well crafted with great longevity.  You can grab Cool Water for nostalgia purposes at $30. At the $100 price point, you can get yourself so many great modern fragrances that last."", 'I bought recently a bottle of Fierce. The bottle is from 2019. I wanted to find out by myself several things around this fragrance. Especially how similar it is to my Percival and how good the projection and longevity is. Now some people may complain that I have an older batch, yet most started also complaining around 2015 that Fierce is just a shadow of itself, so I think my 2019 bottle is still ok to write about. While I really appreciate Percival in all aspects, I have to say that just comparing the pure smell and the fragrance itself for me Fierce is the better one. It is not easy to put in words, I would say Fierce is more smooth, not so harsh, it is more soft, it has something addicting, what makes you (and women) crave for more, wanting to be near that smell and want to smell it again and again. Don`t get me wrong: Percival is a great fragrance, I like to wear it especially for sports, it is more fresher, more aromatic than Fierce. It has more depth and is more grown up. It smells grown up and the ingredients are of high quality. While on the other hand Fierce has something rather cosy and sweet in it, if those words really fit to describe it. Do not expect complexity from this fragrance, but yeah I finally understand why this is a compliment magnet. Fierce and Percival do not make each other redundant.  Projection. Reading about it here I would have not even tried it. Glad I did. The first time I sprayed it on myself (5 sprays), my cousin ringed the door bell maybe 20 minutes later. He came in and told me that he could smell it outside in front of the closed apartment door and that it smells very simple but amazing and he would wear it. So much about that. The AF stores spray it probably on clothes and everywhere and it smells so strong, that one can smell it outside of the store. And we do have winter and cold weather here in Germany. So I can`t imagine this one not projecting in warmer climate. Longevity. In this moment while I am writing this, my sweatshirt from yesterday is on a chair maybe 1 meter from me and I still get whiffs of it, 12 hours after using Fierce. So yeah one has to spray it properly over clothes and oneself, lets say 5-6 sprays, and yeah maybe one has to reapply after several hours, but for me it is fine.  I see also people writing that Fierce is way overused, that maybe is the case in the USA. In Germany we never had that crazy Abercrombie&Fitch wave, so most people never used Fierce. Boss Bottled was the norm here. Today most guys do not even know about it, so it is a very rare scent and I am glad it is.', ""For the newer bottles - just a few different designs but same exact cologne. This is different and has been reformulated but honestly, I prefer the new formulations. Old formulation was explosive beast mode filling the whole mall. I think the smell is so close to the old formulation but does not last as long. Still I get at least 5 to 6 hours with this. But make no mistake - this is one of the best-smelling colognes ever made. Everyone loves this and while I normally never get complimented on colognes - this has on multiple different occasions. I wonder if that is the ISO super / Hediome molecules working their magic. For those older guys who feel this is more for the teenager and mid-twenties and won't try - you may want to try Parfums de Marly Percival. Smells so similar, clonish like but lasts way longer - easily 8 + hours. But that will cost you three times more."", 'Smells amazing but i believe it has been reformulated because it just doesnt last like it used to.

It is after all the iconic smell that pretty much in every fragrance store at mall in early 2000. It smells really good, don't get me wrong. And the fact that it is very mass appealing and lots of dupe are the reason that this DNA works well even for today. Also it is very versatile. Suitable for every ocassion, at any time all-year round. The only downside is the performance. Not the best sillage and not very long-lasting. It is rather expensive for that poor performance.

Can you {fill in question}....yep. This although is an og type fragrance and opened the door to a bunch of other fragrances. This will always have a place to remind people where the style started.

It's pleasant and crowd pleasing and I could see how it would rake in compliments especially with better longevity and projection, but still the scent is basic you could get better fresh appealing fragrances aswell so for me the smell was definitely underwhelming to say the least. Second the longevity and projection... when I first sprayed it I was already underwhelmed by the fragrance itself but when I sprayed the fragrance and it only lasted 30 minutes that was a deal breaker, you need to spray this like 10 times to get 5 hours üòÖüòÖ. Third thing is price... Price is relatively decent but still expensive for what you get (80$ for a 3.4oz listed on their website), when my bottle runs out I will not be getting another bottle to say the least. Overall I give it a 2.5 out of 10 it serves its purpose as a gym bag or after shower fragrance nothing else, i really tried to like it but its boringness and lack of preformance leave it with my complete dissatisfaction... you could get nautica voyage or Tommy Bahama very cool and even Tommy hillfiger which smell better, last longer and are half the price with more bang for your buck."", 'I just bought a new bottle from Abercrombie.com and even though the smell itself is not as good as it used to be, back in the early 2000‚Äôs, it‚Äôs still good.

So disappointing too cause it‚Äôs such a classic scent. I remember my first bottle I bought back in the early 2000‚Äôs‚Ä¶..2-3 sprays and it lasted like 7-8 hours.  I was able to find a sealed in the box silver cap Fierce on eBay. The seller clearly didn‚Äôt know what he had cause I paid $75 for it.

Women of all ages love this cologne - it is an amazing compliment getter. It projects well for first few hours and has a very pleasant freshness to it. The mid and dry down leave a wonderful scent trail that again it grabs attention in a great way. I am totally shocked to be honest. Lasts maybe 5 hours on my skin but good enough. I was told PDM Percival was a niche version of fierce and I can kind of agree but Percival gave me a headache when oversprayed (more beast mode projection). I will stick with the original fierce. A++ rated cologne Update: I was able to try the original Fierce (silver cap) vs new formulation 2021 batch. The Original was EXTREME beastmode. Like room-filling and choking everyone out.

It smells like some Old Navy store brand or Ross clearance bin fragrance that you could pick up for ten smackers, and not like a quality fragrance.', 'Regardless of the history you have with this fragrance, it is (was) a great fragrance. Bought a bottle at the mall (clear one, without the picture), and went through it pretty quickly since it was so subtle and the longevity was atrocious. I decided to buy the bottle directly from the store because I thought maybe the one I had bought was a copy. Nope, same atrocious longevity and sillage. I find it shocking because this was one of the strongest scent in the market, but sadly, now it has the strength of a body spray. Very disappointed with FIERCE and the poor longevity/sillage.

It was just one that did it for me when I first smelled it. It was that one I had been looking for.

People are loyal to, or avoid brands for the wrong reasons. Branding helps sell products, and attempts to create a favorable image for the buyer. While I don\'t prefer pictures of shirtless men on my stuff, that\'s about the only negative aspect to Abercrombie\'s ""Fierce"" cologne. That\'s it. Just some dumb torso on a bottle (and the sticker can be removed). If you can\'t get past that;or all your other ideas about what Abercrombie is or isn\'t, you\'re missing out on an incredible fragrance. It took me years to figure out what it was. During my mid 20\'s, I didn\'t really care about fragrances. I definitely like them, but didn\'t pay much attention or bother wearing them. ""Fierce"" was the only scent that I really noticed. I\'d be out and about, and catch this scent in the air all of a sudden. It would immediately grab my attention. This went on for years, because I couldn\'t approach the random ""Fierce"" wearer and say ""Hey man, what are you wearing?"". Finally I figured it out. I bought a very nice used sweater on Ebay. When it arrived, it had been sprayed with this stuff. So I took the sweater and had people smell it to identify what this scent was. The closest suggestion was a girl who said ""Uh, I think that\'s Abercrombie, but I\'m not sure."". So I had to go to an Abercrombie store to check it out. I\'ll admit this was my first time in there. I didn\'t waste time. I sprayed the paper and ran out. At first I thought this girl was wrong, but after about a 5 minute dry-down the woods came out and I had finally figured it out! Anyway, this scent goes beyond teenagers, it goes beyond ""frat boys"" and even beyond what Abercrombie would like you to believe their image is. This is simply an excellent fragrance. I believe this citrus/woods combo is the best out there. The dry-down of ""Fierce"" is my favorite in my collection. It is definitely masculine; that of a refined, adventurous type guy. Nothing about this says 15 year old punk. NOTHING. Nothing about the vibe it captures says ""What\'s up bro?"". In fact, most of the people that I encounter love the scent, and are completely unfamiliar with it or where it comes from. They know nothing beyond the fact that it smells absolutely wonderful... You can associate fragrances with whatever you want, but if the ""Abercrombie"" name and the little shirtless guy on the bottle is scaring you away, that\'s really too bad. (for you)', 'For teenage boys and those who came of age in the 2000s, this scent is the GOAT. My scent preferences have skewed to the more niche, high-end and considerably more expensive in recent years, but there‚Äôs still nothing like a bottle of Fierce. The 2000s will never die, so long as this scent lives on. Just one gentle whiff of this (not that there is anything remotely gentle about this fragrance, as you can smell it a mile away ‚Äì and I mean that in the best possible way), and you‚Äôre instantly transported back to Abercrombie & Fitch in a 2000s era mall. Some say this has been reformulated to blandness but, no, it‚Äôs still all here. Pure nostalgia. Black and white images of shirtless toned men, and pumping techno music. Dragging your parents and their credits cards with you, while they are seated underneath a giant moose head and they suffer from stimulation overload, as you retreat to the fitting room to try on the very tightest and hottest pink polo you can find. Disclaimer: I worked for A&F and Hollister throughout college during the mid-00s, and I can recognize this scent immediately. Every now and then I‚Äôll pass a stranger on the street, and get a waft of Fierce. It‚Äôs unmistakable. And somehow not outdated. As always, it reeks of masculine collegiate sex. Any man wearing this will smell fresh, clean, youthful, and will make you do a double-take. Although I personally outgrew this scent years ago, I bought a bottle recently for old time‚Äôs sake. Occasionally I‚Äôll spritz it in my apartment or spray it on when I want to recapture my teenage self. One of my friends asked me in surprise, ‚ÄúAre you wearing‚Ä¶Fierce?,‚Äù and I replied ‚ÄúHell yes, I am.‚Äù ""It smells so good,‚Äù she laughed, as we both agreed that this scent has managed to stand the test of time and is still capable of activating hormones and testosterone.

Hmm, slightly dull metallic filters of half naked youths usually provocatively posed in black and white snapshots with minimalistic backgrounds...dang, where have I seen THAT before!? The clothing is mediocre, I mean really REALLY look at it...strip it of its label and it can easily pass for something you\'d find at Old Navy (and for a better price). So when it came to hearing about their ""new and exciting male perfume"", I wasn\'t exactly running to camp outside the mall doors to get a first whiff of it.  Let me state that although I may sound rigid in opinion, I know how to be objective. I kept an open mind and decided to sample it since by chance, I was sent a trial size in the mail (entirely unrequested btw). Since it HAS happened before that I get surprised and even humbled with fragrances by designers I don\'t care much for (i.e. Donna Karan and Thierry Mugler), I gave A&F\'s Fierce the same opportunity to impress. My impression: This is like the newblood in the locker room with some older fragrances. I can smell where it has a little of this fragrance and that one but Fierce has that typical air of youthful inexperience which it masks with its overconfident sillage. It reminded me a little of Egoiste Platinum without its refinement, Dolce & Gabbana pour Homme but without body hair (or testosterone for that matter), I mean, Fierce smelled pretty good but it didn\'t make me think of unique, much less drool worthy sexy at all other than the well defined torso on the bottle like Arabian Night and a few other reviewers have said.  This is the same sort of marketing 101 that many fall for, ""Put something naked on it and people will wanna buy it"", sex sells as they say. Its why you see ads with some scantily clad woman smiling like she is OH SO totally turned ON and excited to be posed sitting on top of a TIRE. It is also a general rule of thumb that if you have to get a naked person to sell your product, its more than likely a cheap product.When was the last time a naked chick needed to be used to sell a Rolls Royce? Go ahead, I\'ll wait.  In all, Fierce was not something special to me, it wasn\'t unique, it didn\'t incite, inspire nor intrigue. It IS pleasant, but not something that I will place on the mantle of great male fragrances or seducers nor will it knock perfumes such as Drakkar off of its (then) trendy but freakishly sexy legendary perch. So scratch me off the list of the hordes of females that go nuts for Fierce. I\'m too spoiled by the past greats to be impressed by this.', ""I felt like I needed to review this based on how unhappy I am with the recent formulation. I bought this from the Abercrombie store around April 2016.  This is not the same juice as it was mid 2000s. I remember the vintage fierce lasting 10 hours+ -- it would last from early morning 7am until 10pm, only after showering would the scent go away. This new juice is so watered down it's no longer worth the purchase. There are much cheaper alternatives (I paid ~$80 USD for 50ml bottle) with much better performance. I get 30min-1hour of okay projection and then it becomes a skin scent. I'm not even kidding, sprayed it at 9pm tonight and its a skin scent at 10:30pm. Asked someone if they could smell my cologne and she could only smell it when she dug her nose into my arm. I really wanted to like this because I remember how much of a compliment monster it used to be. Also, no one in my country uses Abercrombie so I figured it would be unique. Save yourself the money and pass on this one.  The scent is nice, but what's the point if it only lasts about an hour and no one can smell it. Huge disappointment and wishing I just purchased another bottle of Legend Mont Blanc instead of this garbage. It's really sad seeing a once great fragrance turn to crap after reformulations.

A joyful alternation of harmonious clear and sunny, citrus, woody and musky notes. In the Himalaya fragrance, the Mediterranean grit of citrus nuances energizes which magically blend with warmer and spicier tones of vetiver, oriental sandalwood and lively pepper. The precious ambergris reigns supreme over the entire temporal olfactory experience and the Tonkino musk adds sensual and opulent depth. A dynamic, kaleidoscopic fragrance that is ""quicksilver on you"" just like the regal packaging that characterizes it. Maison Creed hardly misses a beat and Himalaya is a clear confirmation of this.', 'Frutiger aero and Y2K core if it had a smell', 'If Silver Mountain Water and Green Irish Tweed had a baby, this is what it would be. Himalaya is a really nice and fresh fragrance. The citrus opening is present, but it has an airy quality to it, along with a musky and creamy sandalwood in the back. The scent as a whole gives me barbershoppy vibes as the barbershops I used to go to pre-pandemic used to smell similar to this from what I remember. Once it dries down, the sandalwood comes forward, but the citruses remain, although much less prominent. Dried down, Himalaya has this sharp, almost aldehydic smell to it, which gives off the ""icy"" feel of the fragrance. As much as I like Himalaya, I don\'t find it to be a good performing fragrance. I\'m unsure if my sample is old, if I go nose blind to these types of fragrances really quickly, if Himalaya simply doesn\'t perform well or maybe all of the above, but I don\'t get much projection from this fragrance at all. It seems to project decently right after spraying, but after about 30 minutes or so I have a hard time catching whiffs of it when I move, only smelling it when I smell my arm up close. I think Kilian\'s Vodka on the Rocks is a pretty similar fragrance to Himalaya, but even though I consider that to also not perform too well, it projects more and I can smell it for longer than Himalaya. It\'s been almost four hours since I applied it on myself and it\'s pretty much become a skin scent. I\'ll probably get a larger decant in the near future but as it stands I would not consider buying a full sized bottle, even at discounter prices. However, I might consider it if I see better performance with a larger decant.', 'mid', ""Pretty basic smelling freshie.

The dna isn't uncommon either as there's quite a few designers that falls under the same category. If you don't have anything similar under this dna, I'm sure it'll be good for you."", 'Cold, Fresh, Light, Creamy Snow. Smells like an icy evergreen pine range dusted with snow in the alpines. So clean, so simple, nothing quite like it - but not a mind-blower. Does need a re-apply around lunchtime.', 'Today I\'m moving onto a Creed fragrance I\'m fairly intrigued to try; Himalaya. Just the name itself evokes images of icy mountains and fresh air. I\'m not sure how much of that is going to translate into how the fragrance smells, but I\'m excited to see. This is another Creed fragrance that doesn\'t get talked about as much as the others, but it\'s not as obscure as say Royal Water that I reviewed a couple of days ago. Without futher adieu, let\'s get into it; Scent: The opening is citrusy, spicy, and woody. The primary notes I get are Calabrian bergamot, grapefruit, Sicilian lemon, and sandalwood. The strongest of the notes are the Calabrian bergamot and sandalwood. The Calabrian bergamot opens with a burst of fresh citrus. It\'s not lemon-y like most bergamot notes I encounter; instead it lands somewhere between a lime and an orange. Bitter and tart like a lime, but juicy and sweet like an orange. Right behind that citrus is the signature peppery spiciness that tickles the nose just a bit. This bergamot note also forgoes its typical aromatic qualities in exchange for a soft, subtle floral nuance. Sharing the spotlight with the Calabrian bergamot is the sandalwood. Nothing out of the ordinary here; bold and woody with distinct powdery tones. Up next is the grapefruit and Sicilian lemon. The grapefruit offers more citrus but with a signature bitterness, separate from that of the Calabrian bergamot. Lastly, the Sicilian lemon doubles down with more citrus, but this time focused on lemon (obviously) and a  noticeable rindiness. The dry down is musky, woody, and earthy. The primary notes I get are musk, sandalwood, bergamot, and ambergris. The strongest of the notes are the musk and sandalwood. The musk has emerged in the dry down to be a primary note. It\'s fresh, clean, and airy with just a bit of fuzziness. The sandalwood has continued into the dry down with the same woody and powdery tones from the opening at the same intensity; not any weaker or stronger. This is followed by the ambergris and bergamot. The bergamot still has the same citrusy and spicy accord from the opening, just toned down and more mellow. Lastly, the ambergris is noticeable in the background as a pronounced earthiness nuanced with a bit of warmth. In fact, the earthiness was so palpable that I initially thought it was a patchouli note that I had overlooked; but nope, just ambergris. It\'s worth mentioning that I also get a distinct ""icy"" accord here. I\'m not sure why or how, and maybe it\'s just me associating from the name of the fragrance, but I get ""cold"" vibes from Himalaya. Performance: Initial projection within the first hour is strong at around 6 feet. Sillage matches that strength with an easily noticeable scent trail. After a few hours the performance was unchanged. At the 7 hour mark the projection was about 3 feet and the scent trail was still noticeable. The fragrance lasted about 9-10 hours before becoming a skin scent. When to wear: Himalaya shines best as a daytime spring/summer fragrance. The brightness of the citrus notes in the opening and the fresh musk in the dry down lend themselves well to warmer weather. As for occasion, this fragrance will feel appropriate for pretty much anything you can think of. Casual, formal, even office wear; Himalaya will match the tone. Blind buy: If you like fresh and woody fragrances Himalaya is a pretty safe blind buy. Strangely enough, I can understand the comparisons to Zoologist Penguin, particularly in the dry down; so if you\'ve ever experienced that and enjoyed it, you\'ll probably enjoy Himalaya as well. It\'s like Penguin made mass-appealing. Final verdict: Himalaya was quite the experience. There was more of a transition between opening and dry down than I thought there would be, but it was very interesting and enjoyable. It definitely does evoke the impression of being in the mountains with that mysterious ""icy"" tone. Performance is solid for such a fresh scent. Strong projection and scent trails for the first few hours, and lasting around 9-10 before becoming a skin scent. When it comes to versatility, I would consider Himalaya average. It will work for essentially any occasions you can think of, but only in warmer weather. Mass-appeal is high for Himalaya; most people will agree it smells great and there aren\'t any weird or challenging notes in the composition that would throw someone off. To wrap this up; I thought Himalaya was going to be something special when I first smelled it, and I thought right. Between the fresh mountain air feeling I get from it, and the respectable performance it comes with, Himalaya is worth the money. I will be getting a bottle of this when I can. Scent: 10/10 Longevity: 8/10 Sillage: 8/10', 'The channel that flows within Creed Himalaya evokes an oriental subtly that is not common and seeks not to attract nor grab at one‚Äôs attention; it speaks to an assent to attain wisdom, which shares some elements that are universal yet still singularly unique and thereby discovered, beloved, praised, recognized, and adored.

The ones I bought all smelled exactly the same, but not the same as the sample from LuckyScent. (The bottles I bought were from ForeverLux, Le Perfect, and from a private seller on ebay).

Literally one of my favorite perfumes of all time. So good', ""The vintage formulation of Himalaya is my absolute favorite fragrance and my signature scent. This stuff will never get boring to me. I'm currently on my 4th bottle of it ever since I got back into fragrances about 3 years ago. I know one day I won't be able to get a vintage batch, so I decided to try a recent F batch. What Creed has done to Himalaya is an absolute travesty. The F batch Himalaya is a shell of it's former self.  The vintage batch goes through 3-4 different phases and the bold calming and warming sandalwood base in the dry down and the sourness from the ambergris in the far dry down which could be considered the 4th stage is completely gone in the F batch and all we're left with is a faded perfumy smell. =(. I enjoy wearing vintage Himalaya to bed in the colder months because the sandalwood in the dry down makes you feel so cozy while under the blanket. Now it's all gone in the F batch.  Performance on the new F batch is poor as well. It doesn't take long, maybe after an hour or so for it to enter the faded perfumy smell phase. The vintage batch lasts all day while giving you a good amount of time to experience each phase. All the people here who love Himalaya right now based on the current formulation, I wonder how much you'd like Himalaya if you could experience a vintage batch.  I wear Himalaya all throughout the year, and this isn't just a cold weather scent. It works great in the summer, too.  The vintage formulation is truly a beautiful creation and a masterpiece, in my opinion.  Thank you, Pierre Bourdain???"", 'Does not smell unique. Similar to platinum egoist. Other fragrance that are from same genre are - D&G the one EDT, Armani code etc.', 'This smells like freshly falling snow, which I realize is not actually a smell. But I would describe this as fresh, chilly, powdery and white. To me it always seems positive and uplifting. Love it.', ""Reminds me of the mountains of Ladakh, which makes sense. Bold and deep freshness, but somehow has a lightness too; reminds me of glacial water in a small pool formed from the erosion of hard, pale, mountainous rock. This fragrance is like the cold, crisp air of a foggy winter morning mixed with thin ice and dew on grass in a bottle. The fresh citrus allows it to be used in the summer too, thus making it a well-rounded scent. While I like to think that most fragrances can be used at any time of day in (very) specific situations, I don't see myself using Himalaya at night because of the aforementioned morning association. I usually don't like opaque bottles, but the all-silver casing is very apt. This is meant to be a personal record, not a review."", 'Another reformulated one?. This is nothing but lemon , juniper and a sandalwood bomb. Old spice type scent. Smelling this, Antonio Puig -Quorum comes to mind. The smell is dated also now. Creed spice and wood, Original Santal and all Aventus versions are miles better. No thanks to this dud.', 'Oke, my first Creed review. First of all, I have a fondness for the brands fragrances. I like the sort of understated luxury, class and simplicity in the compositions. Their prices are too high considering what you get compared to other perfume houses/makers. However if you are someone of a certain income/status these prices aren\'t really a barrier or concern. I believe Creed as a brand knows this and wont change price/quality because their stuff isn\'t made for fragrance enthousiast, rather its to cater to people with a lot of disposable income. So to the smell... Starts with bright citrus opening which is almost immediately contrasted with a sort of creamy undertone. This gives the sensation of snow. Bright/icy yet crumbles and becomes fluid and soft. This is the first unique thing about it. After about 40minutes there is this slight gunpowder note its soft and understated. Like a metallic lightly smokey accord. It gives the sandalwood textural grit. This reminds me of the flint note in Terre de Hermes. Its there and yet it isn\'t cutting through. it gives a certain mystery.  Without it it would be a simple citrus-musk-sandalwood fragrance. This also brings a sort of salty quality to my nose (which I enjoy) Lavender and woods lend the barbershop edge to it, yet it doesn\'t scream fougere. It stays pretty linear after this, dry down to musky sandalwood.  Its creamy on the skin, its comforting.  Again it has the feeling of luxury and class without being overpowered or to ""perfume-like"" I enjoy this once in a while when i want a soft sandalwood scent.  This isn\'t going to blow your mind, however I don\'t think this brand is about making innovative and challenging compositions.  For enthousiast i recommend finding a clone.', 'This one I have struggled with for a while. To me it‚Äôs a bit of a chameleon. Sometimes it smells like a very dated 80s typical men‚Äôs designer fragrance. Other times it smells like a bar of soap. Next it smells very screechy in the opening and dense at the base. To sum up, it‚Äôs a down the middle freshie for men with a slightly dated feel. Jack of all trades and master of none. It‚Äôs not really a gym or work scent, more like a dumb reach scent for the weekends.  It‚Äôs not going to impress anyone, not even yourself. I own a full bottle, but really struggle to justify buying it ever again. For the asking price of 200 to 300 dollars you can literally buy any niche, designer or indie fragrance you desire. Options are limitless here from Amouage to Malle to MFK to Prada, Dior, you name it.', ""I absolutely love Creed Himalaya. It is very refreshing like a burst of cold fresh dewy air in the mountains at dawn. Then it dries down to a clean creamy aftershave barber shop or freshly groomed gentlemen. I get 1 hour moderate projection and silage and then 3 hours as a skin scent. So this is more suited to run a few errands or go to the gym. Unless you don't mind re spraying and can afford to do so as Creed's are not cheap. It definitely can be a year round scent and signature worthy in my opinion. It does puts me in a great mood while wearing it and I do love displaying the cool silver metallic bottle."", ""The third in the trio of very similar (and IMO worst) perfumes from Creed.  Fresh air, intense saline facets and bergamot pith. Something very green, very bitter in here as well. Like mountain air indeed, but with a big dash of headache.  Definitely something for the one who's looking to get away from designer fragrances and intro niche but just barely."", ""I read and watched lot of reviews on Creed Himalaya, everyone gives lest priority to this gem. So, I too stopped exploring this, but during my search of Bois du Portugal 120 ml bottle, I ended up getting 2018 batch Creed Himalaya.  I was not interested to get it initially; shop person told me to try sample of it for few days and then decide.  I gave 1 test waring and 1 complete waring of it, and I immediately liked it so much, as I got it for good, discounted price I grabbed without any hesitation.  Manly, somehow your typical freshie scent but for a trained nose it is a bit more than that. Very refined & well put together and I cannot see you go wrong with this one. It gives some vibes of icy fresh indeed and it also has a metallic feel to it which I love (maybe that gunpowder shoots at times lol). I got this for a great deal but being a creed, it won't be cheap. If you do like fresh & metallic frags, chances are high for you to enjoy this one. An underrated fragrance.

Beneath that freshness lies the strength of sandalwood and musk, like the solid earth beneath your feet steady, grounding, timeless. Yet, while this Creed is captivating, it does not last long and fades away quickly, like a mist that dissipates too soon.

I absolutely love the smell, it\'s definitely reminiscent of an older fashioned ""gentlemanly"" sort of scent, but that gunpowder smokiness really does come through and the quality of the other notes is very apparent. Probably my favorite from Creed so far.', ""Smells like an grandpa soap to me. I'd rater go silver mountain water for similar vibes.

Discount prices around $200+ always had me wanting something else instead. This was the moment! This one of the best smelling office/professional fragrances I've come across. Does it dress down, too? Yes--I wore it with gym shorts and a T-shirt earlier, but this feels like wearing a nice Italian shirt, suede shoes, and expensive pants. This is a CEO-type of fragrance! Maybe I'm bought too much into the marketing, but it definitely has an icy, mountain feel to it. Because of that edge, I think it's suitable to wear in the cold, and the freshness of it makes it perfect for Summer, too. It's a Swiss army knife fragrance! The longevity leaves a little to be desired (around 5 hours max before becoming a skin scent), but I feel confident that the performance is going to improve when the bottle has macerated a few months. What is it most similar to? It's got some similarities to Millesime Imperial (which I think it's closest to), maybe a touch of green like Green Irish Tweed, and some slight influence from Silver Mountain Water.

There‚Äôs a couple reviews below that state it reminds them of Gillette shaving cream/aftershave, or a shower gel. And I honestly can understand where they‚Äôre coming from, as that‚Äôs the vibe it gives off. That classic barbershop/fougere clean vibe.  To me this scent is very clean and refreshing. It‚Äôs not anything groundbreaking or original. It‚Äôs casual while being upper class.  I have about 12 Creeds now and springing for a full bottle may be a bit redundant for my line up.  But if I were to get it I‚Äôd be wearing it when I just want to feel refreshed and don‚Äôt want to be in a specific vibe ‚Äî after a shower and I‚Äôll be around the house, going for a walk, going to work.  I currently have Royal Water that could fill all those roles with more class, which works for Spring/Summer. But I could see Himalaya filling in for the fall/winter months. To cap it off, it‚Äôs a great performer, smells fantastic, is not polarizing, smells fresh and clean. In the end you smell put together and fresh, with a shower like gel/aftershave vibe.  Maybe I‚Äôll buy a bottle if I feel like I‚Äôm that bougie for after my showers on a weekday. I do love buying Creeds.. UPDATE *Creed boutique gave me 10ml free with a recent purchase I made in-person.  I‚Äôve since been using this here and there in rotation with all my summer/spring fragrances.  Honestly, this stuff is great and gets better with every wear. It‚Äôs so refreshing and clean. You just smell really damn good.  Will buy in the Fall. This is an every season signature type scent', 'This is a beautiful scent. I just received an F batch with the metal cap and the opening literally had me standing in awe for a minute at how lovely it smells. Icy, fresh, grassy and slightly soapy is how I would describe it in the simplest terms. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre standing in a meadow on a snowy mountainside while taking a break during a morning hike. I have nothing else like this and I am super happy to add it to my collection. Classy and super refined, Himalaya has a similar mass appealing yet unique vibe that Silver Mountain Water has, both are just gorgeous, and I feel they make wonderful companions for one another. Neither one is redundant to the other and you can easily dress them up or down just as well. Nobody else does classy and gentlemanly freshness quite like Creed, and this one is a stellar example!', ""@Jon St  You most likely need to give it time. I read an interesting review on this site the other day from someone who went on to explain how to wear perfumes. I thought at first this guy was a little too over the top, but what he said started to sink in and make sense. Then I read a little about the process of perfume maceration, and was surprised at how long it could take; months, and I would say at least 5-6 months if you want to arrive at superb performance. Now, this isn't to say that you shouldn't wear your perfume for this lengthy time, but rather that it may take that amount of time before the performance hits it's peak.

When you first spray it gives the impression of the warmth of the sun touching the clear and white snow and as it dries down the foggy forrest comes through. Quite amazing"", 'I‚Äôm confident Creed just sprayed some lemon pledge and Iso E Super in a bottle and resold it for a couple Benjamin‚Äôs.', ""I like this scent - I perceive it as soft, fluffy, and white (like snow I guess) - it's very pleasant and I'm not smelling any notes that I don't like.

I feel like I will really need to see how it performs in hot weather, but that won't be for several more months (as I write this it's late December in Wisconsin). Between my skin that absorbs fragrances and the colder weather currently, I don't think I'll use this much over the winter - but I am going to Mexico in April and will plan to this along and see how it does there."", 'I get the GIT comparison. The dry down goes the same ambergris way and does smell similar - almost like a lemon cheesecake version of GIT (and someone below referred to a mix of Chanel Allure Homme Blanche edition mixed with GIT which makes sense to me).  I don‚Äôt really get the ‚Äúbarbershop‚Äù reference and I don‚Äôt really get anything too metallic here. If anything, I‚Äôd say GIT is a bit ‚Äúcolder‚Äù which is what I think of when I think barbershop - this is almost warm and sweet. It isn‚Äôt sweet in a modern vanilla heavy ‚Äúclubbing scent‚Äù way, but its more smart and clean lemon cheesecake than barbershop fresh. The opening is a bit‚Ä¶. Meh imo. It‚Äôs safe, it‚Äôs nice, it‚Äôs clean. It doesn‚Äôt blow me away.  I wouldn‚Äôt call this a ‚Äòblue‚Äô scent, but to me it smells a bit shower gel-like in the opening. Like a lemon shower gel. If this were half the price it would be a no brainer. At this price though, it‚Äôs a bit too safe imo. You might not be able to find something which smells exactly the same, but you can get something with the same vibe and which does the same job for a lot less.', 'This and Original Vetiver are my favorites from Creed. They are not the most unique, nor the most famous from the brand, but if you want niche level, office safe, dumb reach fragrances on the blue side of the spectrum they are worth it.', 'Love the clean smell of Creeds.

Light and airy not too overpowering, but lingers for about 4-5 hours atleast off my F001290 batch (all the F batches I have seem really good and preform well atleast 4-7 hours). The presentation and scent are both my favorite out of what I have from Creed. Probably been said a 1000 times, but it is very signature scent worthy and easy to wear.

Nose blindness is a real thing , and just simply spraying below the belt prevents it. Try it .. This fragrance is without a doubt 20/10 for me. Simply put,‚Ä¶ it raises the bar. I‚Äôll always have a bottle in my 300+ frag collection. I‚Äômma try using less this go round and see If I can get 2 years out of a bottle.

It is Soooo Good !! I‚Äôve tried them all and this is by far to me takes the win , yes even over the beloved aventus , GIT & SMW . At first impression upon receiving my first bottle which I blind bought BTW , I thought it was funny , funky, weird, strange, unsure if I made the right choice,‚Ä¶ and let me tell you,,. This took me a few months and quite a few wearing‚Äôs to fully appreciate its elegance. But it is STUNNING !!

If I could only choose one for life, without question,‚Ä¶ This is the one . & I‚Äôll leave it at that. My guess is that anyone hating on this frag in my opinion is most likely only speaking from the angle of using a free sample they got.

The citrus & ambergris does not mix well. The opening is a horrific mess, very intense & offensive to the nose. Smells like a strong cleaning product made into a Mens cologne. My original review had this fragrance as a love for me, but my nose has matured more & preferences have changed. The far dry down ( & I mean far ) is tolerable as a musky, salty skin scent when the sandalwood, citrus & ambergris actually start to tone down & work together.

It's crazy cause when you hear or see anything about Creed, it's 99% the combination of Aventus, GIT, Silver Mountain Water and MI. I know there are plenty more great ones cause I've smelled them. I just refuse to pay such a high price for a fragrance.  From the notes this looks very interesting and you see quite a few people have something to say. I'm really on the fence but the price is cheap.  I think it's sad they sold Creed to someone else cause I'm going thru Creed's catalog of fragrances and the perfumer is always a Creed, even more than one perfumer of utting their heads together. It was one of those things they advertised that gave you this father to son vibe and here they go and just destroy everything their elders created. I mean love ot hate them, they have successfully pulled off a great one selling a $5 fragrance for $500. They are doing something right plus I know there was that thing where certain reviewers were getting juiced to boost the Creed in their top 10 lists and it was some scandal or whatever. But just think, there won't be anymore Creeds doing perfumery for Creed. For a company it's a wise choice, cause the name and Aventus alone will pay off their investments. All's they got to do is sit back and fill orders. Maybe juice a reviewer or just the vibe is still there. The energy you see in Aventus is still strong and people really sit there and compare batches like they really deviate from the exact same formula. Depending on how noseblind they are at the moment, one person may be blind to the citrus so they will swear this batch is more smokey, or someone is noseblind to woody stuff so they argue this batch has more pineapple. When it's all in their heads.  I think I'm gonna try this one just so I have a Creed fragrance, that isn't so ubiquitous. Like these clone nowadays are almost art how good they duplicate a scent. It's good I think cause people do set the prices. If someone can make the same exact thing for 1/15th the price, sorry but it's no longer frowned upon to have clones. This one here seems unique and I got a good general idea what it kind of smells like and for less than $100 I'm gonna try it out. If anything huge I'll edit and say what I think.

So, two sprays only and I headed out to the Docklands (drinks at The Oiler Bar and dinner at Nakhon Thai, both places excellent). For some reason, on my skin at least, this really cooks in warm weather - it comes alive and it\'s the Sandalwood that really stands out. In less warmer weather I get a smooth, creamy affair but in the warmth of the evening, the Sandalwood, smooth but almost fiery in nature becomes the burning star, possibly aided by the ""Gunpowder"" note mentioned on the Creed website. I don\'t see this as a date night fragrance, it isn\'t romantic but then I don\'t believe that was the intention. This would work well in a suited formal or black tie setting. I can add nothing further that hasn\'t already been said.', 'My perhaps somewhat boring and old fashioned dumb-grab, but I do find it underrated. Especially as it is very long projecting on my skin, well beyond 24 hours! (Only ‚ÄùBois de Portugal‚Äù stayed longer, but that one was too heavy for me.) Can something smell both soapy clean and musky at the same time..? Yes, and this is the proof. Initial grapefruit quickly gives way to smooth sandalwood and the depth of ambergris. On the right skin, at least, otherwise it may well just smell like shortlived barbershop, I guess. A very European scent, but I guess Himalaya sounds more cool than Mont Blanc..? Also strongly leaning towards the middle-aged men segment rather than young adventurous mountaineers, but being an overweight 50 yo, I don‚Äôt care. Also a frag for the colder seasons.', 'Smells dated. This would go well with a 40 yr and up man. Mature. Lemony woody, Sandalwood and cream. Nothing special definitely not worth buying.

I got a full-size bottle of it and the batch has virtually no metallic smell and it smells actually really good. The start is really comparable to axe body spray but about an hour later it transforms and smells fantastic. It's like a citrus, woody ambergris musk. As long as longevity and projection this stuff is really strong on me, I've tried a lot of creeds in sample form and this one was the strongest and longest lasting by a long shot. I get a good 12+ hours on my skin and a few feet of projection even 6+ hours after putting it on. in my opinion it's still not worth full price as I got it at a discounter for 50% off but I'm happy with it and I always recommend trying fragrances before you buy bottles, so you aren't disappointed."", 'I like to layer Chanel Allure Homme Blanche over the original Allure Homme.

It\'s a moderate projector at most, a good 4-5 hours of skin scent.

It is long lasting though, like the other Creed perfumes.', 'I do get the comparison with GIT, but this is a very simple fragrance. Lemon, sour grapefruit and a slightly bitter musky earthy dry down.

Maybe its my batch, CM3919P01. I have At The Barber by MMM on one wrist and Himalaya on the other and I'm getting a lot of similarities.  I love this when I want to smell fresh and clean. It's very office friendly and plays best in late fall, winter, and early spring. My biggest complaint is longevity. I only get about an hour of projection and a semi strong skin scent for another 3. When buying a Creed frag I expect at least 6-8 hours of projection. I understand this is a freshie and isn't supposed to be a beast. But it should at least project for a few hours. And I feel like if I overspray it will be too heavy and cloying.  I LOVE wearing this. It's a top 5 scent for me.  I'd love to get my hands on an old bottle of XS. But I don't trust Ebay enough to order one. Anyone know a reputable site to score an old bottle?  Edit: The bottle has matured a bit and I‚Äôm getting about double the performance now.

Mature without being old mannish. The cedar and musk combination is very, very mossy to me. I was amazed oak moss wasn\'t listed on the notes because it\'s very strong and prominent. This was a bit too much when I tried it in warm weather, but on a cooler day it really shined. I wish the citrus notes of the opening stuck around a bit longer. This is definitely a ""power frag"" when worn out or to the office. Will update this if I have any new discoveries while wearing. Update: After wearing a dozen or so more times, I\'d definitely say this is a frag for sub 70 degree days. Really blends nicely with cooler weather, and I would wear it as often as I could if I had a full bottle. I\'m sure it\'s not everyones cup of tea but I have also gotten many compliments.', 'The opening smells the most ""designer"" of all creeds, but isnt a bad thing. I find it easily mass appealling. The mid and drydown on my skin comes quickly - about 30 minutes onwards - and (on my skin) settles into a woody accord reminiscent of Nuit D\'issey for men EDT. So similar in fact that i cant tell them apart. Much later when you shower with hot water, the fragrance surprises by unleashing a floral scent from the opening, but much softer and smoother. Himalaya is an easy wear and i would not hesitate wearing it as a signature scent. Also, the newer (grey juice) Paco Rabanne XS smells 90% like this all the way to the drydown but is so weak the scent disappears completely off my skin after 2 hours. They both become skin scents within the first hour, btw. Interestingly the (yellow juice) original formulation of XS from the 90s which smells more intense was launched earlier than Himalaya.', ""I can't even lie, at my first whiff of this at Neiman Marcus I knew I had to have it. The scent caught me off-guard and I found it so appealing in a quirky way. It also helps that it comes in this awesome silver, alien-looking flacon. I wanted to buy it right there and then...but it was out of stock. Thank goodness, though, because I found it from a third-party website at literally half the price. It finally arrived today and I decided to wear it. I realized what drew me to it: a distinctive, metallic, very icy feel with a citrus background. The iciness/frosty quality that's dominant throughout reminded me of fresh snow being melted in the sun, and it did truly take me on a vicarious trip to the Himalayas. However, as much as I get the cold-temperature vibe from the scent profile itself, I'd argue this cologne is more suited to warmer months, as: a) it'll perform better, and b) it'll be refreshing to smell cool mountainous glacier ice in the scorching heat of the summer. Oddly, I do think there's a similarity between this and Silver Mountain Water, but I find the notes in this more suited to my skin chemistry. Between those two, though, having at least one of them is a must (in my humble opinion) if you are a collector, or growing to be one. It's top-notch perfumery that perfectly and aptly evokes the vibe engraved on the front of the bottle. I know the price is steep, but I found this for $180 when it's normally $300-$350. To me, that's still very much worth it for an excellent scent profile.

The most addictive fragrance I have ever had. Truly amazing silage and longevity. I can describe Himalaya as a ""woody-fresh\'\', metallic, classy and outstanding. Works very well on my skin in cold weather. Pure love!', 'I\'ve been working my way through house of Creed by way of small decants from a vendor I\'ve found to be trustworthy. I even sprung for a full bottle of GIT, would for a few others as well if I were wealthy, and the ones I couldn\'t see wearing or even didn\'t particularly like, I at least appreciated. They\'ve all been excellent in their own way.  Himalaya is the first Creed scent I was just disappointed by.  The initial blast is pure alcohol, period. I quickly picked up an odd barbershop note... not odd, really, in fact, very common and familiar, which is what\'s odd, for a Creed. But I\'ve learned never to judge a Creed until after the first 30 minutes . So, I was patient.  30 minutes later, I said, well, this is definitely a Creed. It has that rich Creed base that I\'ve become very familiar with, I have no idea what it is (ambergris?) but I think of it as a ""satiny"", ""lustrous"" smell, if that makes sense. And on top of that... nothing else. If I inhale deeply I still get that very conventional barbershop note.  It faded to a skin scent relatively quickly. Over the course of the day I\'ve fairly bathed in it, reapplying it heavily as it\'s faded, hoping to catch a whiff of what so many people are raving about. This just doesn\'t have any of the personality or ""wow"" factor that every other Creed I\'ve tried so far has had to one degree or another. First one I probably wouldn\'t bother buying even if price weren\'t an object. My favorite Creeds seem to me to all have that characteristic base, which I do love, and then meld that seamlessly that with something else fantastic and unique. But Himalaya takes that base, and then does nothing with it. Except perhaps tops off the gap usually occupied by something interesting with a little touch of something very generic and conventional, maybe. And maybe even just a little perfumey and feminine.  So far, Creeds always reliably smell better than anything else, and there are always cheaper colognes that people will say smell similar, but the cheaper alternatives have never proven to be worth it and despite the much higher price I\'ve always thought the Creeds always proved to be a much better value. This is the first time I don\'t feel that way. If I want to smell this nondescript, there are much cheaper barbershop scents (which I do wear and enjoy) that this really is so trivial an improvement on that the vast price difference isn\'t worth it.', 'Oh wow...looking through all my old scents...I had a super small decant of this from waaaay back.

Of course, I\'m not going to buy a full bottle of super expensive watered down Creed these days...so I\'ll just stick with my ""Bentley - Azure"".

Love it', ""To me my favorite creed by a mile. I originally bought imperial mill. And loved the formula, 14 years ago. I still like it but it now has a weird note in not the big of a fan of. BTW looking to sell or trade that bottle. Now for Himalaya. This was the third creed I bought about a decade ago, before 8 really got into niche fragrances. I had zero clue wtf ambergris even was and really didn't even look at the notes. I just smelled it and loved it. Now that I'm well into my journey I now know why I like it so much. It's super fresh and the dry down is the ambergris one fell in love with. Creed as a house isn't even a top ten house for me anymore so I'm by no means a creed enthusiast.

Creed Vetiver uses Mandarin for the citrus in the top note. Creed Vetiver has the Vetiver in the middle which is not present in the Creed Himalaya. Himalaya lists just \'Sandalwood\' as a middle note--all by itself whereas Creed Vetiver designates Mysore Sandalwood along with Florentine Iris, and obviously. . . Haitian Vetiver. The Base of Himalaya is the same except it adds Cedar. The result is that Himalaya has no Vetiver, and the effect of Ambergris with no Vetiver around--plus Cedar is added. Ambergris as described by chemist Gunther Ohloff : \'humid, earthy, fecal, marine, algoid, tobacco-like, sandalwood- like , sweet, animal, musky, radiant. What I think is happening with the Ambergris is it has a tobacco-like scent in this fragrance. It is dancing with the Cedar and has a for-sure salty, marine- like quality. The combo of Cedar and Ambergris is new to me, and I think this is what is unique about Creed Himalaya. I like it alot. The Ambergris is nothing crass. Don\'t be afraid. This is not like a whale burping in your face. This is a really unique and natural thing. Why the difference in longevity? I could be wrong, that is why. Still, Mysore Sandalwood versus Sandalwood may be a difference. Maybe different Musks. Wow.... so many different Musks out there. This fragrance should be evaluated in decant. Not because anything is wrong, it is just delightful. I am new to Creed and they have a broad product line. So far, Creed seems to make agreeable and highest quality fragrances, so you can\'t really go wrong. I think. . . . the way to go is to use decants and focus in on favorites. This juice is not inexpensive so bumbling around could be reckless.', ""This is a bit of a quiet masterpiece in the Creed range.  The opening is fairly citrus heavy with a beautiful green, natural smell - somewhat classic barber shoppy vibe, albeit with a definite oriental note from the sandalwood. For me this fades after an hour, leaving one of the most elegant and addictive amber/musk bases I have come across. It manages to smell warm and welcoming whilst also retaining a heady, temple incense like quality. Incredibly agreeable and mass appealing in typical Creed fashion, this fragrance also feels luxurious and exotic.  Although overpriced, I've never smelled anything quite like it - certainly no dupe/clone has ever come close to the real deal.  I get about 30 mins of decent projection, followed by an hour or so of arm's length projection, after which it fades to more or less a skin scent. The amazing base will last until the next day on clothes, but is gone from my skin after about 5-6 hours.  For me, Himalaya does what it does better than any other fragrance I have come across. Addictive and refined."", 'Test wearing Himalaya for the first time. 3 hours in. It\'s indeed a pretty weak or ""moderate"" performer as the longevity rating here indicates. 7 sprays, including clothes. Pretty nice scent, but nothing mindblowing. Wouldn\'t make my top 20 overall in my collection. Definitely behind Bois du Portugal, Royal Oud, Viking, Green Irish Tweed, Aventus, Spice and Wood, EROLFA for me. Probably behind Original Vetiver and Virgin Island Water too. I don\'t have the others yet. Update: wearing again many months later. Its growing on me. Still too close to the skin performance-wise but scent profile is very nice. I\'ve never smelled Paco Rabanne XS, but it doesn\'t bother me if this is very similar. Get your nose on enough fragrances and you realize that scent profile groupings are basically everywhere and with every brand. If Himalaya is a ""rip off"" of XS then Roja\'s Oligarch is a rip off of Terre d\'Hermes, etc. etc. But Himalaya has very little similarity to Chanel Platinum Egoiste, that I can tell you. Lol.', ""So far I‚Äôve only owned full bottles of designer fragrances and never thought I‚Äôd drop the money for a full flacon of a niche fragrance, let alone a Creed.

Now, I have no problem with Aventus overall, and I don‚Äôt even have a problem with trendy youtube fragrance bros.

I‚Äôm genuinely grateful I discovered this one first.  I absolutely love this fragrance and it instantly clicked with me much more than GIT and SMW, and that‚Äôs high praise because I absolutely adore those scents and find them to be masterful and timeless creations. However, as of writing, Himalaya is my favorite fragrance I‚Äôve ever worn. It‚Äôs absolutely top notch and impeccably crafted and smells like a million bucks, seriously. In some ways I find it is kind of a blend between GIT and SMW‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs got the rich, slightly green/rugged masculine quality of GIT and the smooth, fresh crispness (a bit of a cooling effect, slightly metallic) of SMW, but it‚Äôs definitely its own scent, I‚Äôm just saying that for perspective in case you are a fan of those other scents.  From the very first blast, Himalaya is just heavenly, the citrus hitting your nose with a crisp freshness the likes I‚Äôve never smelled anywhere else. Sure, I‚Äôve smelled amazing woody/citrus frags with similar opening notes, but NEVER any that were this natural, with a smoothness and depth that only comes from the finest ingredients that money can buy. I get a lot of the divine citrus, that smooth, clean, yet slightly earthy sandalwood, and a sort of fuzzy, textured musk and ambergris. (EDIT: Fragrantica does NOT list all the official notes on this page and needs to be updated. I figured out what was giving it that texture.. Gunpowder!! It is definitely noticeable here, along with some pepper... it gives it a VERY unique, textured grit, which enhances the ambergris IMO... it's honestly amazing and truly unique). Its truly hard to describe in words, as it feels a bit earthy and musky but never too rough or offensive (I did find aventus could be offensive at times), and it‚Äôs blended so well it just feels like the purest, cleanest, most natural and comforting scent I‚Äôve ever worn. It oozes a sort of weathered confidence and oneness with nature. This is not for the flashy, gaudy guy with a fast car who goes clubbing. This is for the guy who has seen and experienced the world first hand and has the patience, wisdom, and experience necessary to succeed at whatever he puts his mind to. He doesn‚Äôt need to tell you about all the things he‚Äôs done or plans to do, he just does it. It reminds me of the mountains, yes, but more so the great outdoors and the planet we live on. Some scents smell Italian, French, British, etc, but this smells worldly. lIt‚Äôs an all-encompassing adventure in a flacon. It‚Äôs clean as hell, it‚Äôs fresh yet it‚Äôs warm, it‚Äôs rugged and earthy yet still calming and smooth. It dries down to a slightly powdery, ultra-clean, resinous scent.

Out of the 7 Creed‚Äôs that I own, I would re-buy 3 of them, one of which would be Himalaya. Clean and musky, with some woods and a hint of ambergris. It‚Äôs a very simple fragrance but it works so well. I have received positive comments when wearing Himalaya and I don‚Äôt think that this would offend anybody. Great for the office and in casual settings (probably wouldn‚Äôt wear it formally but I have other Creed‚Äôs for that). My 2017 bottle has excellent longevity too - literally all day. It doesn‚Äôt project much, but this isn‚Äôt the type of fragrance that‚Äôs worn for attention. Clean, professional, quality ingredients, great performance, criminally underrated.', 'Nice clean soapy fragrance for a gentleman in the office or out enjoying casual affairs. I agree it is simple and easygoing for all seasons. I personally prefer spring and fall as the best times to wear. Quality as with all Creeds with their signature ambergris and musk in the the dry down. Can be quite strong in terms of projection so 2 sprays will do the job. IMO: 7/10', 'The opening to my nose is 99% Green Irish Tweed. After the dry down it settles into a beautiful ambergris and musk. It‚Äôs a people pleaser and is a Swiss Army knife if you need a niche dumb reach. For a Creed, this one has better than average longevity.  It‚Äôs not super unique but what it does, it does very well. Edit: Been wearing this more in the cold weather and is still fairly reminiscent of GIT but more soapy (Irish Spring). It also has a vey fleeting vibe of Brut. It comes and goes but it‚Äôs very faint and doesn‚Äôt last long (I kinda like it!).  I‚Äôm not sure why Himalaya isn‚Äôt talked about more...especially for office or casual wear. It‚Äôs so easy to pull off and inoffensive. The ambergris and musk in the dry down are better than any other office fragrance I own! Cheers!', ""It arrived today, and I get it. My third Creed, having tried 10 of them and owning clones of most of them. I have worn a sample of Himalaya, and own a good dupe, Alexandria's Himayan Mountains. But of course the real thing is as always a thing of delicate beauty that can't be fully replicated. That Creed DNA--ambergris/musk. That minty, herbal wind right after the superb citrus blast. Grapefruit is the true icy character here, though that seems odd. I am surprised the sandalwood isn't more prominent as in dupes. After all, Creed has it as the sole mid-note. But the revelation I now have is that Himalaya is the theme to all the Creed freshy variations. It acts as the template, the essence and satellite for them. This gets knocked for being the least distinctive of them all, and maybe so, but it hints at them all (or they all hint at it). And this is safe, mass-appealing and luxuriously inviting. If those first two adjectives are dirty words, don't take them as such; a Creed this friendly is still a Creed, and the wearer feels and smells delectable as only Creed can provide. The strength is misleading. The nature of this and many fresh Creeds leads to anosmia, but it impressively projects, make no mistake. If another fragrance can state its citrus as natural yet loud as this, I haven't found it."", 'A short, sweet, and likely to be unpopular review, but this is exactly what I thought when I sprayed it and my opinion remains unchanged: Creed Himalaya - an extraordinarily expensive way to inhabit the (albeit not unpleasant) smell of a bottle of Lynx shower gel!  Also, longevity could be (some might say should be) a lot better', ""Probably my go-to Creed when I am not sure what works for the occasion. I wear this frag day/night, hot/cold, office/play and it just works. Performs great and that musky/ambergris drydown drives 'em nuts.

This comes from a guy with several Creed bangers.

Modern XS sucks so this is the play unless you can find early batches of XS that not turned. I unfortunately had one turn bad."", ""I have tried Paco Rabanne XS vintage and the newer reformulated version. They seem very similar at first, but in experience they're just not satisfying; they smell like cheap designer. Having owned a 10ml decant of Himalaya, I kept on reaching back for it and my wife keeps asking me what I'm wearing so I had to pull the trigger on an original bottle. I love the pillow soft creamy ambergris besides its soapy, clean and fresh character. It does seem very generic in a way, but I still love wearing it, especially at home. It's the only original Creed I own. For the other Creed's I am more than happy with (very well done) dupes, but for Himalaya the dupes did not work for me. Quite ironic if you think about how 'generic' Himalaya smells, clone brands just don't seem to grasp its simplistic character."", 'Get XS by Paco Rabanne, its even better', 'Mysterious scent. I smell cinnamon water in here. Definitely try before you buy. Overall good. Best reserved for cold weather. I would not call this a summer scent but it is definitely has a cooling sort of aspect.

And here let me slap you another one.. high five. That's for smelling like pure money."", ""Himalaya is just all about this slightly icy cool quality. It has the menthol-like feel with a fresh citrus and strong woody scent, which all blend nicely and nothing really sticks out. As the icy feel melts away, the scent gets more oriental-like sweet and really clean musky but nice. Even at the base, the scent still stay fresh and somewhat soapy sharp. I find it very exhilarating and masculine in a good way. I like! This is not something I gotta have, but it's nice to try, and the icy manly feel is very interesting in a fragrance. I wouldn't mind having one or two when I won a lottery. Update: Oops I robbed a bank and bought a bottle. :)"", ""BRILLIANT and highly under-rated fragrance IMO. I've owned this fragrance for years, but have typically only worn it in during the Fall months. Shame on me, because I recently re-discovered this fragrance and have been wearing it quite regularly during the Spring and Summer months.  Citrus, musk and creamy sandalwood that are blended with a very nice and natural-smelling ambergris note. It's a very nice, excellent quality, masculine scent that I find perfect for an office setting; On one hand, I could say that Himalaya is not spectacular but rather a safe, masculine, fresh-woody fragrance. On the other hand, that's part of this Himalaya's charm (it's just solid, reliably great scent) that I find to be highly under-rated. I get an honest 7-8 hours out of this fragrance with moderate projection. Again, perfect for a day in the office during the Spring and Fall, but I've fallen in love with this one and find it to be a versatile fragrance that is appropriate for most occasions. If you're a fan of a gentleman's sandalwood, musk and ambergris scent then you should give this one a try."", 'Very underrated. Such a clean, great smelling scent. It‚Äôs timeless. One of Creed‚Äôs best and massively undervalued. Prefer this over SMW.', ""Still a 10/10 for me, will never be without a bottle. I must say the new batches are still very nice, I've owned 2007-2022 batches and I still love the new juice. Older juice is more dense though. This works year round and for any occasion. In summer is it bright vibrant uplifting and winter crisp cool that cuts through the cold air. I'll admit I didn't like it years back when I first tried it but ir grew on my fast. Absolutely love it!"", ""Smells like that old-fashioned bar of soap that you washed your hands with at your grandma's house - pleasant enough - but your grandma didn't spend over $200 for her soap."", 'I\'ve never written a bad review about anything, but I\'ll make an exception for Himalaya. Not because the citrus and ambergris clash horribly, transforming what should have been an ordinary woody ""men\'s fragrance"" into a soapy mess which refuses to settle down.  That would be bad enough. But what gets to me is the Tibetan-mountaineering-gunpowder-macho back story which Creed came up with to sell us this hilariously clumsy and unadventurous scent. For a small fortune, too. For a much more inspired take on the Himalayas, try Bertrand Duchaufour\'s ""Dzongkha"" for l\'Artisan Parfumeur.', ""Lovely fragrance, but just too sharp and intense for me. It's wonderful once it's dried down and the citrus gives way to wood/musk, but on me that takes a good 4 hours in the winter and practically doesn't happen at all in the summer. I've taken to spraying it on the inside of my suit jackets (lightly) at night, so that by the next morning the scent has mellowed into something appropriate for the office."", ""Straight up soap.

Perhaps more to ""unisex"". May not be very obviously vetiver-ish. Too soapy to the extent that even reminds me of Amouage Lyric Man!', 'Quality fragrance. I sprayed once on my hand and I can still smell it hours later. But, just like Dyptique\'s Vetyverio, EM Molecule 03, and a few others, it\'s too much for me. It just smells swampy lol The image I get in my mind is ""green, dirty and wet"". There\'s also a raw leather facet, which is deranging, and limit offensive. Not as bad as Hemingway and Sultan Vetiver, but still. Lunar Vetiver? No way. LV is much smoother and much more wearable. It\'s actually one of the best unisex vetivers around.', ""There are two accords that I have uncontrollable weaknesses for: leather and vetiver. It might have been a foregone conclusion that I was going to really like Vetiver Extraordinaire, particularly since it's a Malle perfume composed by Dominique Ropion. I am happy to confirm that conclusion, yet also say I am pleasantly surprised. Vetiver Extraordinaire is not quite what I expected. Vetiver is a shape shifter. Depending upon the species, terroir, and extraction method, you can get numerous different characteristics out of vetiver - some very pleasant, some quite challenging - from hyper green, aromatic, salty and sweaty qualities to fetid and swampy to smoky, woody, and incense-like, and combinations thereof. Malle and Ropion bring all of vetiver's characteristics out front-and-center in Vetiver Extraordinaire, with the help of some other materials. The top of the fragrance is a burst of bitter bergamot and oranges, and pepper. Vetiver is also present in the top as well, and what the fruits and pepper call forward is vetiver's spicy, fruity, green, bitter, and semi-sweaty note. What's notable about this is a lack of piquancy typically associated with these notes, that nose-tingling feeling that is common with the bitter citrus, pepper, and hyper green vetiver. The surprise I mentioned at the beginning is this smoothness, and also quite a welcome change. These rather challenging characteristics of vetiver are not muted or held back, just kept in-check and made to behave. Once the top notes dry down, the green aromatic vetiver continues but is given a heaping dose of cashmeran - and a high quality cashmeran to boot. Presenting types of milky sandalwood and fresh cedar notes with the green aromatic quality of the vetiver sitting over top of them, the cashmeran also has this effect of superbly texturizing the greenness and woodiness to a silky/velvety smoothness. The heart of this perfume is so good. Not only is one side of vetiver's character present - the green, aromatic, and salty side - but with the addition of cashmeran its woody side is brought forward as well while keeping to the mandate of good behavior. The brand uses words like elegant and sophisticated and playful to describe Vetiver Extraordinaire, and that is completely correct. While somehow being quite complex and of very high quality, it also manages a sort of lightness of being and an unrefined childlike energy that puts a big grin on my face. The final and very pleasant surprise comes with the last dry down, which, fortunately, unlike most modern vetivers, doesn't descend into a heaping messy pile of rough-cut jagged woods. Instead, the lightness of being becomes lighter still, and a mossy note and musk accord nestle themselves on your skin. This is a most excellent vetiver, one of the best I have ever smelled (I have to say that quietly because my vintage bottle of Guerlain EdC is within earshot). Malle and Ropion have taken this most humble and ubiquitous of grasses, a staple for thousands of years across the tropics, cleaned it up and dressed it up without dampening its energetic side. Superb."", ""Extraordinarily smelly. Some people have a funny idea of sophistication )) It smells like a swamp, peat and sphagnum moss. Damp and musty. Fortunately, projection and staying power are very poor. Fortunately, I only spent money on a sample. I'm still trying to replace the old Sycamore EDT and trying different vetivers. This one is the worst so far."", ""Just buy Sultan Vetiver and save the money. It's a better, longer lasting version of this. Quality is also on par."", 'Clean, smooth, fresh vertiver and woods. Masculine. Really quite nice but not worth the price in my opinion amongst a sea of nice vertiver fragrances. It can be found on ebay for ¬£150 with is more reasonable but that comes with its own risks.

However, I don't knew why I hate this perfume"", 'The most beautiful vetiver I have ever smelled. So natural / sparkly, and the earthy notes in this really conjures up memories for some reason. I feel like a child again in the terrarium room at the museum in Jurassic Park or something lol This scent is awesome! This actually might be my favorite fragrance of all time.', 'On my skin it is intimate-moderate silage and longevity.  For me vetiver extraordinaire is unisex but more manly.  It is a good choice even for blind buy, if you like woody oak-moss scents. Scent: peppery, a little bit salty, mossy, and in the middle of scent vetiver.  I do not feel licorice like a note or accord. But profile of a scent goes in that way. It is not usual men scent, I do not feel you can use it everywhere or take a compliment every time. vetiver extraordinaire sounds right in every season from winter to fall. I use it for special places, where I need relaxed and not noisy fragrance.  If you need a fragrance with six-feet silage vetiver extraordinaire will not make it CONCLUSION  7/10 Well balanced woody fragrance', ""I get mainly a grassy, earthy wood accord, backed by the crispness of tangy soap. There's a zesty, spice-cupboard element in the opening that I find interesting and dimensional, but on my skin it flattens out and loses a lot of its dimensionality fairly early on in the dry down.  I also get a strange sort of musty and mulchy background note that wobbles between intriguing and off-putting from minute to minute. Overall this one isn't for me."", 'Love this smell‚Ä¶. My favorite Vetiver fragrance but just doesn‚Äôt last on my skin for some reason.', ""Smells great. Manly. Luxurious. Almost like a gentleman's version of Sauvage because of the peppery mix with freshness. Earthy and smoky and fresh.  When it comes to performance, I think some people here became anosmic. This one lasts way over 12 hours. I have a recent batch. It doesn't radiate like old batches of Interlude but it does last very long.  You have to try it before you buy it. It contains a musky note, maybe from the cumin.  Pricing? Yeah, too much. But if you can afford it and you like it, go for it. It works everywhere."", 'Specimen vetiver with accentuated peppery and licorice facets Judging from a lot of the reviews below, particularly from those offering mostly immediate reactions, it appears this one is very misunderstood. It also makes sense considering vetiver is everywhere and everyone has at least on one occasion encountered Encre Noir or Grey Vetiver or even something Terre d‚ÄôHermes adjacent. Starting from the opening, what immediately caught my interest is the absence of heavy citrus dose. Citrus was always the means of opening the vetiver up, turning its robust peat like earthiness into more of a greenly hued oily woodiness (see Diptyque Vetiverio EDT where vetiver is at its most ethereal).  As Malle explains on the website, the vetiver here is a particular fractionated type, processed to rid the vetiver oil of its filthiest aspects, the leathery peat and earthy soil like quality. The result being a vetiver that doesn‚Äôt need much lift or dilution. Instead peppery facets dominate the top, a cold spicy opening, piquant but clean. As the fleeting pepper dissipates, I mostly pick up the clean root like vetiver, resembling licorice slightly, but also quite woody and with some residual earthiness. While the opening feels fresh and cool, the base keeps on developing over several hours, a slight glow of myrrh and some smokiness, indeed a suggestion of caraway. Over time I pickup up more sandalwood, surprisingly not much oakmoss to my nose. Overall quite a bold composition, not in a stark or odd way, more so in the way it stays true to its self, vetiver from start to finish, peak quality through and through. Something I like to wear on solemn and contemplative days, second only to Sel de Vetiver or Sycomore.', 'It‚Äôs in the details. This is without doubt another masterful composition by Ropion. Very elegant and masculine. Quite aromatic for being a vetiver-centric composition. The bitter orange complements the the grassy-aromatic-bitter vetiver perfectly. A bit peppery-spicy, but it‚Äôs only noticeable in the beginning, and honestly, I think it fits the composition very nicely as well. The base-composition is perhaps its foremost strength. Everything is perfectly balanced. It‚Äôs not loud, nor extravagant, or screaming for attention. It‚Äôs elegant and effortless. Beautiful work.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, performance is not acceptable. It fades away just too fast. I imagine it has been reformulated for the worse, like many others from the house. I curse this sad evolution of Frederic Malle.', 'Kinda boring straight vetiver scent. All the other notes are very subdued. Average projection and longevity, nothing ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù there.  Reminds me of TDH Intense Vetiver but much lighter and airier.', ""OK, sommelier here, but will try to be romantic: 10 min after spraying I get a dry orange peel nose dominating, something boozy as well, Sweet fortified aged italian white wine type of a dried fig character. There are some palo santo type of woody notes, I guess it's cedar and licquorice. That's it for now. A verrry calming scent. It wants you to sit down and contemplate or have a casual conversation. The scent might develop but I experience it as a bit underwhelming and of course not worth the price. I feel bad for being honest since I know there is great effort and quality behind it. It's a really good perfume, but maybe more suitable for a male duck to wear it. When is your duck's next birthday?"", ""i wouldn't really call this vetiver extraordinaire - in fact, the vetiver is very much overpowered and overlooked, which didn't bode well for myself who was looking for vetiver heavy fragrances. it's very fresh and earthy - i can smell soil, and even mint, although there's no notes that match those smells within it. i find the fragrance as a whole a little boring - it is quite generic and masculine, until the softer woody drydown kicks in. for the price, it's very mid, and nothing stands out about it. and once again. barely a hint of vetiver 5/10 disappointing"", ""Got this as a sample. I have tried many vetiver scents and I would say many are not so great, many remind me of raid bug spray on the dry down. I was hopeful after reading the reviews that this would be different and maybe loved, but alas the dry down just smells like raid bug spray. The opening is quite nice and if it stayed like that it would be top tier but really only smells good for a few mins IMO. With the dry down this smelled a bit more peppery to me than some other vetiver fragrances but the end was the same as all the others I don't care for. I still haven't found a vetiver fragrance I truly love. But so far my favorite vetiver forward fragrances are still Roja Dove Vetiver Pour Homme and Tom Fords Grey Vetiver. Still a bit bug spray but much more interesting outside of that."", 'Smells like a beautiful spa, but also slightly like parshnip or some other earthy root vegetable. Unexpectedly delightful. Calming in a way that lavender is calming, or maybe even like to rosemary oil with some salty breeze from the sea in the Mediterranean summer evenings. Wonderful.', 'Lemonade / mineral water', 'honestly the best you can get with vetiver fragrances, not that i have tried THAT many but then again..i think i found the one :)', 'Vetiver Extraordinaire was on my short list for awhile, while searching for ""the perfect vetiver"". Something with the best qualities of all the different vetiver varieties‚Äîgrassy, earthy, woody, smoky, yet fresh and uplifting.  My first impressions were a love, and even though I haven\'t smelled VE in a while, I can still distinctly call to mind its unique aroma. The bitter orange and spiced opening, the woody/subtle oakmoss tinged backbone, and the very faithful and present vetiver that does center the qualities I was looking for.  After some time, I ended up growing tired of Vetiver Extraordinaire and didn\'t pick up a bottle due to a few reasons. The main dealbreaker was a very tenacious musk note in the base that starts to rear its head in the heart, and just doesn\'t quit. It\'s somewhere between a soapy and makeup bag/lipstick feel, and feels a bit too cloying. It leans a bit feminine, which isn\'t a dealbreaker, but it also gives a off a ""tacky conspicuous wealth"" vibe, which is a dealbreaker. In general, the luxury marketing markup is a big turn off, especially with brands like Lalique, Guerlain, Essential Parfums, CDG, La Curie etc. offering quality classic and avant garde offerings for far less.  Full retail for a 100ml of Vetiver Extraordinaire is $410 USD, which is laughable for 99% of us.  The musk note, plus the absolutely ludicrous price, firmly swept this off my to-buy list.  I still think it\'s a very well done fragrance, but I have other vetiver scents I quite like (Guerlain, Vettiveru 2, Private Label, Encre Noire) that fill the hole in my heart just fine. Still looking for a more primal, simple almost soliflore vetiver that bridges the gap between fine perfumery and aromatherapy. I\'ve got my eye on Heeley\'s Vetiver Veritas next. The search continues!', 'Unisex vetiver fragrance which has excellent longevity and projection. I really love this and it is one of the best vetiver fragrances out there, also the best fragrance from the brand. It is not overly soapy or too dry, it is perfectly balanced. Safe blind buy if you like vetiver and want to smell expensive. :)', 'I don\'t like Vetiver perfumes, I mean typical Vetiver which are almost all masculine. Otherwise I love to wear many masculine perfumes but Vetiver is something which is not attractive on women.  First I was thinking that there is nothing ""extraordinaire"" in this but the more I worn it the more I came into the conclusion that this is the first Vetiver which is absolutely beautiful and pretty on women so this is unisex Vetiver. Of course it\'s because of how Vetiver is made, how much there is Vetiver in it but it\'s mostly because of wonderfully made blend. Vetiver is not sharp at all, not off putting nor too strong. Citruses don\'t have a big role which is more than fine for me since those can be tricky to my nose. They are in the opening but otherwise they stay far away in the background. Woody notes in the middle, especially Sandalwood softens Vetiver like Cashmeran as well and the result is velvety soft and indulgent. Musk in the base supports them perfectly. I\'m not the right person to analyse Vetiver more since mostly I can\'t wear them enough. I can say for example that Nishane\'s Sultan Vetiver and Roja\'s Vetiver are very good top quality vetiver scents but honestly I don\'t use my time for that category. However, I can highly recommend V√©tiver Extraordinaire to both women and men.

In which during this time it released pollen, the flower will turn golden yellow and it produced a really really nice scent. Cant describe the smell but it is really nice. when you walk in the field you can detect the smell whenever it is close by.  So I always wonder, if only there is a fragrance that smell like this. A vetiver lover myself, I owned Nishane Sultan Vetiver, Roja Vetiver Parfum Cologne, Encre Noir and some others, constantly trying out vetiver centric scent out there. Until this one pop up in one of my favourite youtube fragrance reviewer, took the liberty of buying a tester vial for this. It is not cheap, blind buy would be a risky thing. Had to test before pulling any trigger Tested it and boom! this smell exactly like the oil palm male inflorescences!! finally there is one fragrance that smell like it! this is unique, i guess it came from this beautiful blend between cloves and vetiver. Dominique Ropion is a genius! this is a masterpiece, this is art. This is what I am looking for. A fragrance that smell like oil palm male flowers. I loved it. Gonna get this one day soon.', ""I have a small 10ml bottle from 2013, it's really nuclear, it lasts more than 24 hours on my skin and projects very strongly for several hours, it's just incredible for a vetiver perfume.

Mr. Ropion had chosen the right name, everything is extraordinary in this vetiver masterpiece"", 'One of my favourite from the house. Clean, pure, minimal, reserved, French.  I love vetiver fragrances and this one so me has an aura of quiet sophistication. The vetiver to my nose moves in ever so slightly minty and musky direction which gives it a freshness I love. It sits close to the skin which for this perfume makes it all the better as it enhances its quiet class.  This is something I would love to use as a daily wear if funds allowed but for the time being I reserve it for daytime wears when I need that dose of French refinement.', 'Saw a comment by a viewer on Persolaise‚Äôs channel that noted a passing similarity to Maurice Roucel‚Äôs Dans Tes Bras ‚Ä¶ now I can‚Äôt unsee it.

I was really struck with just how raw, grassy, and legible of a vetiver it was, topped off with the bright, bitter orange and bergamot and a refined spicy smokiness leading into the base. It made me feel so sophisticated: after all, at the time it was the most expensive fragrance purchase I had made up to that point. It would be years before I'd buy my next FM.  I wore the devil out of it in the next few years, but opted not to replenish it, as over time, I became far more awestruck by vetiver frags from the likes of Annick Goutal, Etro, and Miller Harris. I realized that, Vetiver Extraordinaire, while\xa0a quite a lovely and refined creation of Ropion's, it wasn't quite as extraordinary as I had originally thought.

It is now a somewhat watered down version of what I remembered as extra potent, but it is still a marvelous creation.  The current version is weaker but still lasts all day with one spray.

Take, portrof a lady, take musc ravageur. Take this one. My skin has a concurrence of guilt because it pulls the worst out of almost every fragrance, but I'm amazed by by the harshness that FM creations show from the very first whiff.

Pretty expensive, but worth trying if you love vetiver. Rather inoffensive but simultaneously characterful scent. Masculine, and clean. Edit: this is leaning from a like to a love. Once it dries down slightly the pink pepper/clove comes through and makes it slightly less minty and more spicy and warm. Reminiscent of Creed Viking. Very, very good. Highly recommend."", 'I got a sample a year ago and hated it initially. It had a pungent cumin note to my nose and did not care enough to play with it any further. Decided to put it on recently and suddenly everything was different. Oh my goodness, what a beauty.  This perfume sits on my skin with all of its layers intact, present, not changing but existing as one colossal entity. It is up to the wearer to explore and enjoy each note in their own timing. Feels like being in a lush forest at night without a worry in mind, body or spirit. Stunning.', 'I think this is one of my favorite vetivers, I just find it hard to spend so much on a fragrance I have many versions of, and instead chose my one Frederic Malle purchase (so far) as the equally impressive French Lover because it felt more unique. People mention that as a vetiver fragrance but it doesn\'t really fit the bill to me, as the dry down is more musk and the bitter green is coming from galbanum and oakmoss. While sitll slightly bitter, this is a purer vetiver fragrance than FL, in which you get all those diffusively earthy and rooty grass-like aromas that feel so delicate and refreshing, which I believe is common for haitian vetiver. The twist here comes from leaning into a warm-spice direction with the fruity heat from pink pepper and cloves. It\'s a really interesting way to fill out the heart since other florals and spices like nutmeg or cardamom or other things can render vetiver feeling dry and dusty, which you see in Guerlain\'s Vetiver and a few other ""cool spice"" takes on the plant. I find citrus usually helps pull it out of that dusty dimension with it\'s naturally ""juicy"" associations, and fortunately the citrus here is very natural and sugar-less. The mix of woods and myrhh also compliments everything so well by extending that charming spice blend into the base. I love how clean it feels while connecting the dots from spicy and alive, to earthy and comforting without feeling too mature. I still think it\'s probably not worth a full bottle but for lovers of this style and lovers of the note, it\'s a great perfume to get your hands on. The dry down is less unique and a more predictably light and fresh haitian vetiver, but maybe when I\'m in the mood to consolidate my collection I\'ll fall back on this to replace what I have.', 'I bought Dossier‚Äôs interpretation of this fragrance & it smells exactly like tequila right from the bottle! Then within minutes, it quickly dissipated leaving behind a faint powdery vetiver / wood-like smell. This is not a fragrance to wear throughout the day as it just doesn‚Äôt perform well. However, it is a fun addition to my Demeter Fragrance Library. I poured it into an empty Demeter 1 oz spray bottle & using my label maker, I labeled it tequila!', ""Picked up a sample at the Frederic Malle boutique in the Upper East Side. Not the one for me.  Smelled great off of the tester, but the skin never lies. On paper, the bergamont note wasn't really present, and really just punched up the pink pepper. Off of skin, the pepper is further back in mix, and the bergamont is in the front of the mix.  Bergamont, along with nutmeg, are my least favorite notes. Still looking forward to testing the other fragrances that popped for me (Noir Espices, Portrait of a Lady, Musc Ravaguer)"", 'This is identical to TF‚Äôs gray vetiver in the sense of being a hyper clean vetiver.

Extremely versatile.', 'absolutely love it think Guerlain Vetiver but a bit more woody and a bit more smokey that makes it a bit more deep and mature EDIT: wish it would perform better', ""I write my reviews for my own future reference. Ok, slightly familiar scent, but after racking my brain most of the day it wasn't until reading other's reviews that the scent (I'm assuming the vetiver portion) landed with a familiar memory, shaving foam. The first time I used shaving foam it was from a green and white can so old even the bottom of the can was rusting, but as the only can around, that is what I was left with. This fragrance is far more sophisticated, elegant, and unfortunately as fleeting as that memory. While there is a bit of warmth and delicacy to this scent, I can't decide if I like it as a potential scent for myself or just appreciate the scent as a scent. While moderate at first, it dries down so close to the skin it loses it somewhere between moderate and intimate in sillage. It is still lingering after 6 hours, but does this matter if I more or less forget I even sprayed a fragrance today? I feel it needs to be bigger, but is that possible without losing it's breezy elegance. I'll need to try some other vetiver fragrances to decide if this direction in fragrance is even me. A straight face for the price point. (11/18/22 Edit) Testing this blind seven months I generally still feel the same. A nice leather-vegetably dry down and overall fragrance but whose uniqueness is not greater than its price point."", 'First impression reminded me of Aesop Tacit!!!!! Beautiful vetiver combined with cloves and fruity scents (In this one: Bergamot and bitter orange ; In Aesop Tacit: Yuzu). I think the slight differences come from the more woody notes in the Vetiver extraordinaire, including a tinge of sandalwood and cedar. Both are amazing and super nonoffensive fragrances suitable for every season.  (I just tried this one and FM Synthetic jungle.

Please do not get me wrong, this is a really well made, high quality fragrance, the blend is excellent no doubt. It can be worn anywhere anytime in spring and summer, mostly daytime, without anyone giving you the wrong look. Where my issue is with this thing is, basically, it has little to no character. I love that my fragrances have at least a little bit of edge, that something that will maybe offend someone. That's the part of why i wear fragrance, to leave an impression on myself, and on someone that smells me. This does nothing to me, it reminds me that boredom can easily be found anywhere and everywhere. I want to spend my money on something that excites me. This leaves me completely without a reaction. So basically the worst possible outcome a fragrance can have on me."", ""Beautiful, high-quality Vetiver fragrance. So pleasant and fresh but not sharp or screechy.  Leaning masculine, I don't think I could handle this on me. Would love to smell this on men!! Project and sillage is not very nice, close to skin.

Green, fresh and with mass appeal, it is masculine-leaning and easy to wear. While I dislike the opening, it gets better and has its moments.  VE opens with a slightly bitter citrus note, with damp, herbal vetiver present from the beginning. For me, this opening is surprisingly jarring and unpleasant - it simply reminds me of the squeeze of lemon and sprinkle of herbs used to garnish salmon. Thankfully, this subsides, and it improves considerably as it develops. It mellows, becoming more dry and cohesive as it develops on my skin. Here, the vetiver is bolstered by woody and spicy notes, giving a dry, grassy impression. Balsamic, resinous notes creep in as it dries down further, complementing the vetiver beautifully. Here, VE is at its best, and the green, woody vetiver note really shines. There is a whisper of mossiness as it fades, becoming an earthy, musky skin scent. Sillage and longevity are both moderate, and it fades to a skin scent within five hours on me.  Masculine-leaning, subtle and reasonably traditional, this is a nice vetiver-centred scent, but the performance is lacking for its price. Guerlain V√©tiver, even the current version, is a superior vetiver scent in my opinion. 3/5 (points lost for the fish dinner opening, but that is perhaps simply down to an unfortunate personal association).', ""a sophisticated vetiver scent; the opening citrus is nice. unfortunately I go anosmic to this pretty quickly and the perfomance is rather average. a very dry and woody perfume, this is unisex leaning masculine- i could see a classy older man wearing this. it's a safe, uncontroversial, and honestly pretty forgettable scent. i like this perfume but nothing I could justify spending $400 on for 100ml."", ""First of all I genuinely like the scent profile. That earthiness of the vetiver and smokiness of the woods with some crisp freshness is great. Not as fresh as Guerlain vetiver or Tom Ford Grey Vetiver and not as woody as enre noir l'extreme. Kind of sits in the middle but hints of each in the fragrance.  In all honesty though at that price point it is not worth your money. Longevity and projection is no where near as good as those are and to be honest you could buy all 3 of them for the price of one bottle of this. This smells closer to encre noir l'extreme than the other 2 and if that is what you are going for you can pick that up for literally ¬£20 from discounters.....no brainer!!! This is a ¬£60 100ml fragrance not the ¬£240 you find in most shops. Nice, but not unique, like I said go for encre noir l'exetreme you'll be just as happy and your wallet will be a lot more healthy."", ""This started off smelling dirty, but it dried down and mellowed out.

I cannot pull the trigger on a bottle at $220/3.4 oz.', ""Opens with a blast of orangey citrus and then fades into a soapy, somewhat generic dry down. This scent is very dry in that there is no discernible sweetness I can detect coming from it. I'm not an expert on vetiver dominant fragrances, but having Guerlain Vetiver as my comparison, Vetiver Extraordinaire strikes me as completely different in every way. This is a scent that needs room to breathe (I may also be temporarily anosmic). Just minutes after application, I am smelling my arm but getting very little of anything. However, when I pull my arm away, occasionally something woody wafts into my nose. I can't really pin down the projection with this one and it seems weak, but more testing may be needed.

The dominant note is vetiver but you get non heavy citruses (to me more bitter orange than bergamot) and the subtle spiciness (from the pink pepper and cloves) with the gorgeous support from the base of woods and musk.

I was gifted a discovery set alongside this and went through a painstaking decision making process of choosing whether to keep the full bottle or not. Through a careful review I decided this was one I would get most wear out of.  I am a huge vetiver fan but can't compare this with Tom Ford's Grey Vetiver or Guerlain's Vetiver beacuse they are just such different fragrances. In my mind they are not comparable.  This is not very powerful but does linger and will catch me unaware when I am wearing it. I would however, as always, appreciate if it were a little stronger."", ""Really wanted to love this (like, I've held off simply buying Guerlain Vetiver so I could smell this). Lovely citrus and vetiver off the top. Settles into the mid 5-10 mins in where the freshness is replaced by a more typical 'earthy' vetiver, myrhh and a bit of wood. Good but not great. Performance is pretty limited--projection is on the mid to low end and I get maybe 4 hours out of three sprays. If I really loved the 'stinkier' vetivers, I'd probably just get Encre Noir or EN Sport and call it a day--better projection, a little less of a niche subtlety, but for a fraction of the price."", 'Niche Encre Noire Vetiver Extraordinaire is wonderful, vetiver-centric fragrance. It indeed smells of earthy woody vetiver, freshened up with lightly-sweet citruses and a dash of spices. It has such a stark similarity to the legendary Lalique Encre Noire & Encre Noire Sport, that one would believe if you tell them that Vetiver Extraordinaire is a flanker of Encre Noire. They have the same vetiver scent. However, Vetiver Extraordinaire is softer, less grassy, and the citrus sweetness is more obvious, as opposed to the dry and heavy smell of Encre Noire and the fresh lemony zest of Encre Noire Sport. Vetiver Extraordinaire also has a softer woody base made of sandalwood/myrrh/cedar. It\'s definitely a wonderful vetiver smell, but with the strong similarity to Encre Noire and the fact that Encre Noire costs literally ~8% the price of Vetiver Extraordinaire of the same size, is it really worth the price? A good performer, suitable for the mature during average-to-cool days. Big ""Like"" for the smell, pass on that price.', 'The opening is so fresh and slightly peppery. Very pleasant in the air around you. However, when the resinous touch kicks in from the myrhh, this turns into something generic and uninspiring. Sample before buying.', ""Woman weighing in here! I sprayed a bit of a sample of Vetiver Extraordinaire out of curiosity. I knew it would be traditionally masculine, but it's Dominique Ropion! I had to try it. Ugh!! A perfectly nice vetiver ruined for me by a body odor smell I could swear is cumin, but maybe just a very animalic musk. I was reading the reviews, checking to see if anyone else had that experience, as cumin isn't listed as a note, and sure enough, others did. That said, it might not be unappealing on a man. After all, cumin is a note found in many seductive feminine scents - I'm thinking specifically of Rochas Femme, but there are others. It's meant to provide that dirty, sweaty I just had a romp in the hay - no pun intended - smell, and combined may have the desired effect on the right guy! I'll have to have my husband wear it the next time I wear Femme, which he loves on me, incidentally!"", ""This is a classy gentleman scent. It doesn't project a lot but it works.

I understand the love, but for me the opening seems a bit sour, the mid a little stuffy, and the drydown a bit beige. But that‚Äôs from someone who likes more lift in a fragrance, quite simply.

What can I say, the name says it all, it's Vetiver, and it's Extraordinary! ;o) To me it's very Vetiver dominant, I don't really get a whole lot of sense of citrus etc that others pick up on and that's part of the product. It has an incredibly clean scent in my opinion. This isn't what you wear to really stand out, it's what you wear in the spring/summer/maybe a little fall too, to smell nice. Not sexy, not crazy stand out, but just very very fresh and nice.  Projection is pretty solid, and longevity is decent too. Not great, but good. I typically use it for just going about my summer day, maybe give a dab or two if going to the gym.

A perfect scent for a hot summers day. Enjoy!', 'ginger, grass, vetiver, bitter orange, leathery, musty, latex, Halloween, baby powder i liked it but it was a weak performer  i would buy a travel size or maybe a smaller decant and that would be good enough for me', 'On my skin, it starts as an earthy orange-ish vetiver. Shortly after it will settle down as creamy/powdery cedar with a subtle nutty/spicy vetiver support, and will stay linear like that until the end. The edges are rounded by the strong presence of clean musk and vanilla who will give the soapy/soft effect, that makes this fragrance nearly unisex. What makes this one very interesting is the probable use of vetiver leaf oil on top of vetiver root, but keep in mind that this fragrance is more about cedar than vetiver. That said, I have to confirm what previous reviewers said: the projection is below average, but longevity is good. Too bad, because it is really well blended, but poor projection is a serious issue given the niche pricing.  In summary, doesn\'t hold the comparison with great vetiver frags, but taken as a cedar frag, it\'s a great one, that should have been named ""Cedre Extraordinaire"". Spring/Summer days, 25+', ""I get Vetiver root blended with musk and a tad bit of spice probably from linalool, it has an airy wet hay feel to it probably due to the scent accords being blended with Geraniol I assume.

Although the Vetiver seems to be contained towards the end, the results are non-the-less still joyful. A little sweeter than I like my vetiver to be but it's been pulled off nicely. The cedar and sandalwood work together beautifully creating a sweet and spicy concatenation. Longevity is great also. Not sure where the Encre Noir references are coming from these two smell absolutely nothing alike."", ""this is the best thing i have smelled in my entire life but at the same time the weakest projection as well...which makes it a tough decision whether to buy or not at such a price. the question here is why to restrict such beauty, same problem goes with 'french lover' which is another masterpiece tamed down to the lowest projection possible. it's not an offense to others if you smell good and if they can smell it...even leads to compliments."", ""Vetiver Extraordinaire has been reformulated. IFRA restricted vetiver oil back in 2015 so vetiver fragrances today are less concentrated due to restrictions of the essential oil. I put on a sample of Vetiver Extraordinaire this morning and I noticed right away it's not as strong as before and it doesn't last either unfortunately.

But honestly, this should be priced around the $40 mark, because it's a very natural fragrance, but let's be honest, it's nowhere worth the asking price. About the scent: It's woody, green and has a aromatic vibe. It has a fresh beginning and brings memory of Adidas Sport Field for some reason. The middle notes are a lot like 'Empire by Trump' without the longevity. Trust me, compare these two and I bet most of you can't tell the difference. The drydown however is significantly different.

Obviously some see it as masculine, but as I'm testing out a few perfumes for a male pal (I'm gifting him a few samples for Christmas) I have a few other men's perfumes on just now, and this leans a bit unisex to my nose, in comparison to Amouage's Journey Man for example, which I'm wearing on the other arm This definitely leans towards the citric/watery end of the vetiver spectrum in its opening notes. The vetiver feels dry, astringent and only very subtly smoky. I start to appreciate the underlying subtle incense more as it dries down. The bergamot definitely has the softer edges you expect from lime as opposed to lemon,it's convincingly fresh-squeezed and transparent, reminding me a bit of Jean Claude Elena style transparency, but not as sharp. If you're testing this in cold weather it will feel a bit light, even insubstantial maybe (also I'm wearing a very light spray), but I can imagine this performing beautifully in summer. For this time of year I'd find Creed's Vetiver more interesting with its smoky edge, or Miller Harris's gorgeously woody and sensual Vetiver Insolent, but those seem a bit heavy in hot weather.  The quality of this becomes far more evident in drydown, and I can see exactly how beautiful it would be in hot summer weather - dry, the sense of a fresh breeze, elegant, but with that underlying saltiness of vetiver - in the right weather this would be a quite sensual perfume.

What is left after an hour or two is a dry, grassy vetiver that starts to lift up the bergamot. I really appreciate the light touch of cloves, sandalwood, myrhh(the medicinal/""moldy"" quality perhaps?), and the pepper. Often vetiver has a cloying aspect to my nose, but this does not. Nor does it veer off in ""limey-vetiver-clean"" territory (bergamot uber!), or go too far in sandalwood which can become somewhat of a sweet wood. This is nicely balanced.

I was wearing Terre de Hermes, when my sample arrived. In the opening, VE reminded me of Terre de Hermes with the citrusy orange peel with vetiver. Frederic Malle Vetiver has more of a pronounced vetiver, the myrre and cloves give it warmth and depth, but it stays fresh also, so it\'s a fragrance of contrasts. It has a very sophisticated classy vib to it, not so fun and fruity as Terre. I am picking up a strong liquorish note in this, though none listed, it ads a piquant touch, not dominant in any way, but clearly noticeable. I can see how some would like that kind of touch. Maybe it\'s the bitter orange, it smells like some bitter spice. This and Sycomore are said to be two of the very finest vetiver based fragrances. Sycomore is more about just vetiver, an embellished vetiver. In Sycomore the vetiver is more vegital, green, fresh.. I prefer it as it\'s more raw and natural. Vetiver Extraordinar, is surely vetiver dominant but it\'s more rounded, complex perhaps.  Update: Opon my second wearing this VE, it\'s amazing how much it smells just like Penheligans "" Sartorial"", 90% same with vetiver amped up. Sartorial is a great quality fragrance, but now can be had for $50/ 100 ml. from fragrance net. Rating: 8.5/10 God bless you. John 3:16.', 'The vetiver is really diff. In it . I had a sample.

Plastic, rubber and small amounts of vetiver makes this unwearable for me. I feel like a walking rubber band every time I wear this. Sorry, I will pass........', 'The ""Real"" Vetiver... Let me start off first of all by saying that I am a huge fan of vetiver in all forms, and a huge fan of vetiver based fragrances. I find this one very authentic and extremely well made. The fragrance starts out with a hit of smoky, earthy vetiver and some citrus. I get the cloves and some dark spices (including black pepper) and it really brings out the ""dark"" aspects of the vetiver root. It is said that perfumer Dominique Ropion, who has done amazing stuff for the Frederic Malle line, used about 25% vetiver absolute when composing this. This makes it the highest concentration of vetiver in a perfume currently available on the market. As a fan of vetiver, this alone made me want to try it. I am also a huge fan of Guerlain Vetiver, but this one is slightly different. Where that one was a balance between vetiver and citrus (ie lemon), this one is a very dark, earthy, rooty type. It showcases the whole root of the plant, almost as it the earth is still clinging to it. I also compare this one to Lalique Encre Noir, but there are noticable differences. Although they are similar in ""feeling"" or ""tone"", the Lalique is sweeter, and less natural. This one is greener and earthier all the way.Vetiver Extraordinaire hits you with a strong blast of vetiver root and says ""here, deal with it"". You have no choice but to accept this in-your-face type of vetiver. As for me, I would consider purchasing, but only because I am a die hard vetiver fan. This one I think is a vetiver fan\'s vetiver, there is no compromise. But I must admit that if you are concerned about cost and versatility then there are other options, the Guerlain, Tom Ford version and the Lalique are all great choices, so don\'t feel under pressure to get this. But if you want it done right, then try this out. My only drawback is that it doesn\'t last the whole length of my day, even though the concentration is high. Still for now, I would only buy this if I had the money to spend on it. Otherwise I can still stick with what I already know.', ""A fragrance that I associate with smell of fresh cut grass. A little spicy in the beginning (cloves and pepper) under a bed of green and grassy vetiver. I am getting some nuances of bitter orange after the initial blast. At this point it smells a little minty and very fresh. After about 30 minutes, the blend settles to a green and bitter, slightly mentholated vetiver. The fragrance is slow to transform and in the dry down, VE meets a slight warmer woodier side. I was expecting to be blown away, to have a new vetiver reference, but it wasn't the case. Actually I have grown to like it quite a bit since my first wearing , but it's not extraordinary. The reason might be that I prefer the rootier and heavier vetivers. This one is too green, grassy, clean and subtle, but with an undeniable blend quality. I am being overly critic, but it's a very solid scent.  Scent: 8/10 Longevity: 7/10 Projection: 5/10"", 'Along with Heely\'s ""Vetiver Veritas"", this is definitely one of the truest incarnations of vetiver I\'ve come across. A sharp blast of bitter citrus and dry spice blend with a raw, rooty hazelnut-toned vetiver, that smells a bit like sticking your head into a new wardrobe yet to be sanded down. Great performance; It projects well for at least 6 hours on my skin. I think it\'s a clean, fresh, rugged scent that would suit most men, in particular 25+.', '@Mr Cornells ~ This fragrance lasted quite long (>8 hours) on my cooler than average skin with moderate sillage. As indicated in the photograph shown here in Fragrantica, the perfume volume is 8% in 96% alcohol so it should be an EDT. A side note, my bottle from 2013 does not have the perfume and alcohol volume indicated separately but simply says 88% volume; however, I do believe that it means the same thing.', ""Vetiver root has been used in perfumery since day one, but the eponymous masculine Vetivers fixate on it with a particular reverence. Vetiver isn‚Äôt simply the masculine equivalent of the feminine white floral. It‚Äôs become a ceremonial totem of male toiletry, ranking with the foug√®re as a masculine olfactory reference. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Big Three (Carven, Guerlain, Givenchy) boosted vetiver from a fixative and a basenote material to the center of the discussion. The Maculine Vetiver became safe harbor in the 1960s-1970s when the underpinnings of masculinity were up for discussion. More vetiver fragrances than you can shake a stick at followed. Some kept close to the scent of the vetiver root itself (eg. Maitre Parfumeur et Gantier Route du Vetiver, Etro Vetiver, Lalique Encre Noire) while others strayed a bit further, riffing on a particular quality of the root (Annick Goutal Vetiver‚Äôs salty iodine, Serge Lutens‚Äôs chocolate Vetiver Oriental, ELDO Fat Electrician‚Äôs plastic and vinyl.)  Vetiver Extraordinaire falls into the conservative camp of Vetiver perfumes and The Big Three are its specific predecessors. All four are sweeping, classical perfumes that balance broad splashes and nuanced choices. Malle and Ropion are too well-versed in composition and history not to have understood the importance of the Big Three, but they chose to rival them rather than to imitate them. Malle also takes advantage of the of the fetishism surrounding the material, and fumies dutifully cite the 25% of vetiver oil used in the composition. Ropion‚Äôs approach is to take vetiver to finishing school. After the dazzling citrus punch of the first sniff, he employs a swirling floral topnote to accentuate vetiver‚Äôs inherent thumping bass range. The liveliness of the topenotes have hints of lipstick and makeup and Vetiver Extraordinaire barely skirts the scandalous 'Old Lady Perfume' territory. The topnotes are ‚Äòperfumey‚Äô and remind me that Ropion known for his over-the-top perfumey feminine florals (Givenchy Amarige and Ysatis, Malle‚Äôs own Carnal Flower). Vetiver Extraordinaire eventually settles into a more traditionally masculine woody range, albeit with a dandy flourish.  Vetiver Extraordinaire captures the sensibility of the Fr√©d√©ric Malle line perfectly. It is a superlative contemporary spin on a traditional form. Though not nearly as ubiquitous, Vetiver Extraordinaire rivals Guerlain Vetiver as the standard-bearer of the genre among vetiver enthusiasts. from scenthurdle.com"", 'I have a thing for lean compositions. Take a key note such as the divine vetiver, acknowledge its angles and try to stress their character by adding minimal touches of notes sharing the same effect. Working this way we have experienced many fabulous vetiver compositions that highlight a certain facet of the root. However this is not the case for Vetiver Extraordinaire as this composition goes for something more challenging and adventurous. It goes for the whole effect, the whole root without emphasizing a particular element. Undertaking such task imagines impossible and the tuning can be embarrassing arduous even if you know exactly what you are doing. Miraculously Vetiver Extraordinaire strikes bull‚Äôs-eye and comes as close to the natural smell of vetiver as never before. The matter with other vetivers is this balance, which deliberately leans towards one or another aspect of the note. I wrote deliberately but VE made me think that more attentively. Perhaps this is more of a deliberate necessity for perfumers while identifying the difficulty to balance the accord to the center point and simulate the heart and soul of the material. If you love vetiver you simply can‚Äôt miss the phenomenal geometric symmetry of Vetiver Extraordinaire. This simply is the Everest of vetiver fragrances.', ""The name of this stuff already gives an idea of what comes after spraying, Vetiver Extraordinare have one of the bests vetiver's in the world of scents,I sincerely hoped that the vetiver note would be more pronounced at the base of this fragance, but not,after bergamot and orange in open,within seconds i feel come dry and woody waves than with to little bit of pink pepper help to giving a warmed , smoky and woody base,after hours,the base comes with sandalwood and cedar, which makes staying the woody aspect of the fragrance, however in the midst of so many woods at the base, appears a single touch of myrrh, sweetening the base and closing wonderfully this masterpiece scent.

The top-notes are a little distracting - an unnecessary ""fresh"" initial element, presumably the citrus - but they disperse swiftly leaving a clever and very sexy vetiver.  It appears to be a single note fragrance but in actual fact I suspect it is a very cunningly constructed raft of elements all combining to bring out the elements of the vetiver keynote. This is clearly a masculine scent, and vetiver is at it\'s best on a man\'s skin. However I love the warm, earthy directness of this one so much that I will certainly get some for my own pleasure.', 'Subtle, clean, and refined. Very warm and woodsy. Easy to wear at work or home. It\'s not really a ""date night"" fragrance, even if you\'ve been dating that person for a while...the vetiver is very clean and blends well, so it wears like more of an aftershave or body wash.  I like it, but I don\'t love it. Too mellow. There are tons of other woodsy fragrances. At this price point, I want more wow. I\'m wasn\'t going to pick on the name because I dig the rhyming...but, if you\'re going to say it\'s ""extraordinaire"" than I think it needs to step up from what is actually ""vetiver, done well."" Addendeum: I made my brother try the sample. It seems reasonable to assume he and I have similar body chemistry, and I thought maybe his dudeliness would add something.

It\'s a nice fragrance but it\'s a bit too subtle, it\'s not showy at all. Some may aprreciate that.  Nothing bad about it, quite sophisticated but lacking ""oomph"". Might make a very good ""professional"" scent, a la Tom Ford Grey Vetiver but warmer.', ""I tested this on a hot summer day, and after cycling in the sun and swimming in the sea twice I could still smell it loud and clear on my wrist in the evening - in other words; the longevity is amazing! The scent is not as spectacular in my eyes (nose), though, or at least not for the first tree to four hours. I love vetiver and i love Frederic Malle's perfumes, but the this was a loud headache inducer for me the first hours after applying one spray (the first five minutes it smells like sweat). After several hours though... the myrrh gets more pronounced and a beautiful powdery warm skin scent appears. If only it was like that at once!

I've tried this one over the years, and there's something lingering that I dislike. I'm not sure if it's the citrus playing in the background, or whether it might be the musty aspects. If someone were to ask me what VE is closest to, I would probably say Sycomore, which I also can't love. So, whatever it is they share is likely the culprit. Although, Sycomore is sweet and VE is dry, there is something in both that I don't like, but between the two I prefer this one. Hopefully, as I wear more of my decant, I can try to figure this one out more. I get slightly better than average projection and very good longevity. My rating for now, is 7.6"", 'This is a very good vetiver fragrance, but not a great one to me. I was expecting great at this price point. Even by the drydown I only detect the vetiver, begamot and pink pepper notes. This is not a bad combo, just wish some of the other notes listed were more noticeable. Longevity and sillage were just ok.', ""Ugly on a woman, eh? Apparently the estrogen leaped out of my pores and did some sort of chemical wizardry because what's on my arm right now makes me smell like I've been rolling around in a dewy meadow. I may have to buy this for myself. It's fresh without being soapy or combative. It smells like the fresh air of a place I want to be. If I were to advertise this for a woman she'd be the hot chick in the hiking boots with wild hair blowing in the wind on a mountain side. I wouldn't wear it in high heels."", ""In my opinion Vetiver Extraordinaire is one of the best from Malle's line, not because it trumps anything else per say, but because unlike others it fizzes and seems to come alive on skin. This is an effervescent vetiver, buoyed by bergamot, neroli, and pink pepper for a fresh and vaguely soapy affect. Vetiver root comprises the spine, but Ropion utilized cedar, saffron, and musk to keep it from becoming too dry and flat like Guerlain's Vetiver. I'm not sure if Safraleine or something similar to safranal was used here, but the mellow spiciness in VE's heart suggests high ingredient quality was employed at a generous dosage, perhaps more than usual. If you like Creed's Vetiver, Original Vetiver, Guerlain Vetiver, and Encre Noire, but want something even crisper, spicier, and more direct, Vetiver Extraordinaire should be on your short list."", ""Wearing this today on a very hot and humid summer day I do love the intense vetiver, probably the best I've tried so far. It sits perfectly on my skin in the heat. Lovely dry down. My only complaint is the short life of the scent, 3 sprays gone completely in less than 3 hours."", ""Of the many vetiver fragrances I have tried, I would guess that this is the truest to the actual scent of vetiver.  There is a brightness and freshness and green/'grassy' quality, perhaps partly due to a subtle citrus note, but also the roots are very evident, giving it a slightly earthy/rootsy quality, but not in a bad way at all. It is just not 'softened' by any real hint of sweetness. In terms of wine I would describe it as really 'dry'. Maybe it should be named 'Just Vetiver'  It has excellent longevity and reasonable projection or sillage. To my mind, it is neither masculine or feminine, and it will not be liked by all, but if you like vetiver, then that is what it truly is.... plain and simple.....or at least to my nose.  The white musk in the base, a note I do not normally enjoy, because of its presence in so many mainstream designer fragrances, is not really evident but probably serves to simply enhance the vetiver. I like it, but I do not love it.  Sycamore with the subtle sandalwood base...or Route de Vetiver softened with the subtle fruity note are preferable for me...but this is the real deal..love it or it hate it...real vetiver..grass, roots and all Update - 03.10.14 - With time I have come to realise that this is a masterpiece of blending. Altough this seems a 'soliflore', in fact that is an illusion. Dominique Ropion seems to have created a vivid and bright 'true' vetiver scent, partly by complementing vetiver with a whole series of notes which are not individually identifiable to most noses. However, each note accents a facet of the vetiver to create perfume 'magic'."", ""smells like repairning cars or motorbikes in your garage. (in a good way) One of the best vetivers i've tried."", 'As I\'ve said in my previous reviews, I cannot do the ""it smells like tree bark, with a hint of vegetable, drying to shake n vac"" thing. But what I can tell you is this is one of the most fabulous fragrances I have ever put on myself, and it\'s fabulous from the first touch on the skin. I have French Lover, and would cut off your arm for it, but this tops it. I got a sample and the first time I wore It 3 women immediately asked me what I was wearing and said they loved it. They ranged in age from 21 to 51. Even 2 of my male friends noticed it and were very positive. Get yourself a sample from somewhere. This truly is a wonderful fragrance. I am waiting for my bottle to arrive. I hate the waiting!', 'Stark, acrid and unforgiving. This is not the warm vetiver of Sycomore, or Route de Vetiver, or even the dark Encre Noire. The fragrance this most reminds me of is the camphorous Hinoki by CdG. Sharp and monolithic. Distinctive....yes, but not very wearable.', ""Might be better on men as rule, but it's better on me than my SO, therefore, I will be keeping this dry, peppery lovely sample for myself. And in my fantasy world where I can buy bottles whenever I want...."", ""Tried Sycomore, tried Encre Noire, tried Guerlain's Vetiver, tried Creed's, tried Hermes Vetiver Tonka... But VE is the best! Guerlain is too soapy fresh, with an old man's feel. Creed is less soapy but has a similar vibe; an innocent vetiver. Herme's is sickly sweet. Hazelnut mixed with vetiver. Imagine dropping the vetiver into a saucepan of syrup and trying ever so hard to separate the two. Sycomore and Encre are similar. But with Encre being darker and bitter, picture Spiderman putting on the Venom suit, corrupted, evil, put still somewhat cool. Both are vetivers dominated by warm woody notes. Imagine the vetiver root pulled out of a forest with the wind catching the smell of a tree truck. Very rustic. Malle's VE doesn't rely on the roots of the vetiver to maintain its masculine edge, but rather the fresh citrus blended with the sharpest green vetiver I have ever come across. As sharp as a razor blade I would say. The ozone notes lightens the scent but also tingles your senses every time VE catches a whiff of the air; sharp green vetiver attacks your senses reminding you of the incisiveness of this vetiver, just when you thought it is gone. A great juxtaposition between lightness (ozone note) and incisiveness without relying on heavy woods (rustic) to depict manliness. Perfect for a classy gentlemen with a mean streak. The greenish, airiness, sharpness, and mossiness of VE makes this one a very unique take on vetiver I must say. Yes, it is more linear than the Sycomores or Encre Noires... But only because it is the purest take on the vetiver note that I have so far come across. Great for Spring and Summer for me! Perfect! Too bad vetiver fragrances in general have only average longevity, 6 to 10 (pushing it) hours"", 'Well, this is the apotheosis of the ""masculine vetiver fragrance"" concept! A SUBLIME composition that immediately jumps at the top of its genre together with other masterpieces such as Sycomore, Route Du Vetiver and the Givenchy\'s. Vetiver Extraordinaire is a stark and edgy composition where the usual bergamot/citrus opening is dried to the bone by sharp woody notes and a massive dose of dry vetiver. Add a nice (and slight) quasi-soapy twist and here\'s a masterpiece. Good sillage and excellent lasting power. One of my favourites. Rating: 9.5/10', ""Attention all men. If you notice youre being followed by a skinny brown haired girl and youre wearing this perfume chances are that it's me. But don't worry, I'm harmless. MAN this is good! Best vetiver ever.

Hell I wish everyone wore this!"", 'The name for Frederic Malle Vetiver Extraordinaire is no hyperbole - this is an extraordinary and unique vetiver, and I have tried a LOT of vetivers. Much has been written about how much vetiver there is in this (taken from the official Malle notes, which emphasize the point), but this is misleading. I love vetiver and have several different essential oils from various locations (they are fairly different from each other). Yes, there is a lot of vetiver in Vetiver Extraordinaire, but it is either an artfully blended vetiver or Ropion got his hands on a vetiver oil unlike any I have smelled. The top and middle have a good dose of dark bitter orange peel and plenty of pink pepper and I suspect something else that I can\'t figure out, maybe it is the clove but it is so blended I can\'t pick it out. I wonder if there isn\'t a big dose of Safraleine in there (warm leather saffron tobacco sweet woody). The blended effect is hard to describe because it is so distinctive and unique - this is unlike any other vetiver perfume I have smelled (note added later - Terre d\'Hermes is somewhat similar). Spicy, earthy, warm, leathery, dark green, with the grassy-rooty-smoky notes of most vetivers muted. The scent changes relatively little and only very slowly with time, getting more wood and myrrh notes in the base. Regardless of the analysis, Vetiver Extraordinaire is indeed a sublime take on this classic essential oil. I am leery of perfumes at this price point, suspecting the price to have more with making them ""exclusive"" than with their quality (in most cases I think this cynical view is correct - these are called Veblen good in economics). But VE is an exception - it is indeed extraordinary and I suppose you have to expect to pay for that.', 'Okay just hear me out,  I live in Malaysia, oil palm trees are something quite common here, a big industry here. Second biggest producer after Indonesia, our big neighbour. I work in this industry for several years now. Did you know that oil palm produce both male and female inflorescences? yesss. The male produced pollen while the female will developed into fruit bunches after cross pollination happened. The male inflorescences at some time in its life cycle will matured up and begin an anthesis stage. In which during this time it released pollen, the flower will turn golden yellow and it produced a really really nice scent. Cant describe the smell but it is really nice. when you walk in the field you can detect the smell whenever it is close by.  So I always wonder, if only there is a fragrance that smell like this. A vetiver lover myself, I owned Nishane Sultan Vetiver, Roja Vetiver Parfum Cologne, Encre Noir and some others, constantly trying out vetiver centric scent out there. Until this one pop up in one of my favourite youtube fragrance reviewer, took the liberty of buying a tester vial for this. It is not cheap, blind buy would be a risky thing. Had to test before pulling any trigger Tested it and boom! this smell exactly like the oil palm male inflorescences!! finally there is one fragrance that smell like it! this is unique, i guess it came from this beautiful blend between cloves and vetiver.

The opening is pretty nice, but on my skin, the drydown goes into a smokey vetiver (which I like) and a mix of musk, pink peppercorn and cumin which smell somewhat like body odor. That body odor scent keeps lingering with tremendous longevity which is not good. The reason I shower, groom and use fragrance is to smell clean and attractive. This seems to work in the exact opposite direction, so I am giving this a wide berth.', 'I straight up dislike this, it reminds me Encre Noir with a rubber note. I had to wash this off as it nearly made me wretch. Definitely for an old man, not my type unfortunately', 'The vetiver smells nice and true to form. I understand the love, but for me the opening seems a bit sour, the mid a little stuffy, and the drydown a bit beige. But that‚Äôs from someone who likes more lift in a fragrance, quite simply. To me this is extremely similar to guerlain vetiver extreme. Extremely similar (hint).']"

It smells so damn good ‚Äî smooth, airy, and masterfully blended ‚Äî but it barely lasts. And honestly, I don‚Äôt care. I still wear it all the time, because when it‚Äôs on, it‚Äôs one of the best-smelling fragrances I own. It makes me feel clean in a way that doesn‚Äôt smell basic, fresh in a way that isn‚Äôt boring, and somehow refined without even trying. I do wish it lasted longer, but for the time it does linger, it‚Äôs genuinely beautiful. At first spray, it‚Äôs an airy blend of bright peony and earthy vetiver, softened by a gentle plum note that adds just enough fruit without ever veering into sweetness. The peony and vetiver create a beautiful, ‚Äúcrunchy‚Äù contrast, and the plum is a soft bridge that smoothes everything out and ties it all together. The incense is there too, contributing to the contrast between depth and brightness, but it's subtle. Dia doesn‚Äôt lean heavy, smoky, or spicy like a typical Amouage might. Instead, it plays in the space between light florals, dry woods, and clean musky skin, blending everything so seamlessly it‚Äôs hard to pick out where one note ends and the next begins. And that‚Äôs where the magic is. This isn‚Äôt one of those ‚Äúwow‚Äù scents that punches you in the face and demands your attention. It‚Äôs a slow burn. It feels like slipping into a pressed white shirt still warm from the sun, walking past blooming trees on a crisp spring morning. It smells like someone who knows they have nothing to prove. The drydown floats between orris and vetiver, with touches of rosewood and labdanum humming in the background. This is the kind of scent you wear for yourself ‚Äî the way niche fragrances are meant to be ‚Äî not for compliments. But if someone does get close enough, they‚Äôll definitely lean in a little more. The performance leaves a lot to be desired. A quick glance through the reviews and it‚Äôs clear: projection is minimal, and it tends to stay close to the skin. You‚Äôll get a few solid hours of gentle projection before it sits so close to the skin you‚Äôll wonder if you even sprayed it that morning. But that‚Äôs not enough to stop it from being one of my favorite fragrances of all time. Would I love if this had the power of Interlude or the longevity of Jubilation 40? Of course. But that softness is part of Dia‚Äôs charm. It doesn‚Äôt try to last forever. It gives you a moment of peace, beauty, and subtle grace. And in this case, that‚Äôs more than enough. Dia Man isn‚Äôt the loudest, longest-lasting, or most ‚ÄúAmouage‚Äù Amouage, but it might just be one of the most special. If you can live with its quiet nature, you‚Äôll find yourself reaching for it again and again. Not because you want to impress anyone‚Ä¶ but because it feels like home. Scent (on skin): 8.5/10 Scent (sillage): 9.5/10 Projection: 3/10 Longevity: 4.5/10 Value: 3/10 Originality: 8.5/10 Mass appeal: 8/10 Versatility: 8.5/10"", 'Clean, soapy, inoffensive, all year round Amouage. The problem with this is after 2-3 hours it become very close to the skin.', 'Happiness in a bottle. All year all occasions Amouage.  Unlike others experienced, on my skin (which is usually a perfume graveyard) longevity is good with moderate silage which is perfect for Dia.  It‚Äôs on the same page as Jubilation XXV for me.  I have a recent batch.', 'Excellent scent but a week performance unfortunately', 'Props to those who are in love with real peony and lotus flower, and adores the scent of purity, and innocent vibes.  Art imitates life. Peony scent cannot be extracted from the flower. Dia Man is probably the greatest imitation of the real thing.  It is soft, subtle, and slightly green. Yes, it is giving off soapy vibes, but if you know the smell of peony by heart, this is very realistic. Each note in the bottle is a supportive artery to the heart (peony). The soft-fresh floral effect starts introducing the earthiness of grassy vetiver in about 30-45 minutes.  Then at the drydown, it has this LIGHT salty-sour woody scent that is present in Lorenzo Villoresi Theseus and in Terre D‚Äôhermes.  To feel that it is worthy, you have to be okay to wear perfumes mainly for yourself and for the love of peony.  Even the performance behaves like the flower. SUBTLE.', ""This fragrance is so bittersweet to me because the blend is masterful as most Amouages tend to be, the complexity of the notes used is so unique and there's truly nothing like this on the market that smells like this and this fragrance is a true blend of French and Middle Eastern perfumery. French perfumery like French food is all about the ingredients or notes playing in perfect harmony with each other to create a concoction that smells ethereal which this does, while Middle Eastern perfumery is about creating 'waves' where you smell each phase of the fragrance separately throughout the wear time. This magically manages to do both. The notes play off each other to create a symphony of olfactory bliss where everything together creates a very poised, regal and luxury feel yet at the same time you can smell the prominent notes and individually pick them out the way you can in Middle Eastern perfumery.  The smell itself is very nostalgic because it smells like numerous different fragrances (the incense reminds me a lot of the incense note in Tiger's Nest by Memo), the plum note is the closest plum I have smelled in any other fragrance to Tom Ford's Plum Japonais and the frankincense is very slightly animalic, very syrupy and amber like - quintessential Amouage. It opens with a lot of 'sweet incense' without it being too overpowering or smoky where you feel like you're being choked out, I personally didn't get much cardamom on skin but others around me said they could smell it albeit it was very faint to them too, I did however get a very slight citrus smell in the opening to balance out the sweetness of the incense.  The mid notes have a prominent plum note and a very light floral aspect to them, if I hadn't seen the note breakdown I wouldn't have been able to tell you it was peony. It smells floral but not like white florals although not like rose either so perhaps 'peony' is then the go-to foral note when it doesn't fit under the rose or white flowers umbrella. It smells like when the wind is lightly floral as you walk by flowering bushes and trees in a park.  On skin I don't get much wood or leather either, I do however get a very slightly animalic frankincense note (which is not listed in the breakdown) but it is unmistakably frankincense and not something else. Don't get much patchouli or vetiver either. I mostly get amber, frankincense and a very dry 'grassy' like smell which I suppose is the vetiver but it's not like a traditional green vetiver note. It smells like super dry, brown grass or almost like hay.  The smell is gorgeous I just wished it lasted longer. This thing is blended like an Amouage, it smells like a work of art as most Amouages do but on skin it lasts no longer than maybe 30 minutes on my skin. Amouage smell and blending with Acqua Di Parma/Jo Malone performance. I hope Amouage strengthen this fragrance because it's a better all weather scent than Reflection in my opinion. So light you could wear 20 sprays on an airplane and within an hour most people would have no idea you have anything on - hence the reason for my 'Ok' rating.

Dia Man was released in 2002; and the perfumer who signs this fragrance is Master Bertrand Duchaufour. An eclectic Cyprus inspired by the natural wonders of Oman, from the rich and dry deserts with their hidden oases, to the dense and humid essence of the Dhofar Mountains during the monsoon; Dia Man encompasses an elegant subtlety of the oriental world, it is an excellent example of lightness and good taste. An Amouage with a certain level of complexity... but it is light, subtle, discreet but that makes its presence felt without making a fuss.  A timeless Classic From Amouage! With formal clothes for everyday wear, it is a mature, sophisticated and vibrant fragrance. Dia Man is a complete chypre with a predominant olfactory facet of Leather. Dia perfume features the treasures of Oman, such as Rock Rose and the finest Silver Frankincense, as well as delicious extracts of Iris Lily, Plum Blossom, and Peony Flower which like Geranium (the masculine rose) bring the fragrance to an additional floral masculinity. This fragrance is always soft and spicy, and with a slight hint of aldehydic. Bitter Orange combining Spices with Flowers and Vetiver with Amber creating an amber woody accord, resulting in an elegant and mature fragrance. It is very suitable for office, Doctor's office, public offices and closed environments, but even more suitable for formal occasions or times when you want to make a good impression but without attracting too much attention. It can be considered unisex perhaps, but with a very evident inclination towards the masculine side without a doubt. A sweet Floral Bouquet joins with the very noticeable Incense to fix the Amouage DNA in a unique and smooth perfection. An intense chypre for the day, with facets: citrus, spices and incense, masterfully combining masculine notes with a discreet floral touch for a unique and enchanting fragrance. In the heart, a highlight is Peony and Ylang that merge in Amber, Patchlouli and Vetiver for a warm, earthy and woody finish. Amouage Dia Man is a sophisticated men's fragrance that harmoniously combines woody, floral, incensed and musky elements... An excellent elegant fragrance option to be worn preferably during the day. And with an overall performance for its proposal from moderate to good. Very Tasty Versatile Perfume! Bacht: 04/2018"", 'This is perfect for the office 9-5', ""Stunning one of my favorite fragrances that is is easy to throw on and overspray. The rosewood is such a masculine note. Beautiful powdery sandalwood (not at the level of mysore, but what is here is very good quality) reminiscent of Creed's Original Santal yet this is a more exciting composition because of the highly unique nature. Very slight synthetic feel at times like most Amouages. If you want all natural perfumery look elsewhere. But, this comes close and gives you a great scent that lasts all day no questions asked."", 'Got a full bottle made before reformulation prior to 2020. Lasts long if interested please message me.', ""This fragrance is in my opinion out of the least appreciated Amouage perfumes. Its composition is a true masterpiece The combination of flowers with rosewood and slight hint of incense create flowery and powdery yet really masculine . Its composition is a true masterpiece The combination of flowers with rosewood and slight hint of incense create flowery and powdery yet really masculine scent. It's just addicting to smell. The only downside is its poor longevity and projection. I'm really dissapointed with it being so weak especially for Amouage which is known for powerfull fragrances. Afterall i really enjoy wearing it, but i cannot do it for a long time."", 'I wonder if the new formulations have changed Dia like it has for jubilation?  If anyone is selling a bottle of DIA made before 2020, contact me. I‚Äôd love to buy it.', 'Got a sample. At first it was nothing to me. It was a quick spray to my hand and it was gone quickly. After a few weeks i found it in the drawer. Gave it another chance and BANG!! Wow... What the hell?! Opulent, juicy, flowery, ambery, cool vetiver... So complex and mature. I love it. There was a good offer at a retailer and I purchased a full bottle. It is 2022 batch. Classy, clean and elegant! My second favourite Amouage after Epic. <3', 'I already left one review but came back here as I have just purchased a back up bottle (found a great deal) and browsed through some of other reviews. I just wanted to say that I 100% disagree with @Chess53 and at the same time I 100% agree with him :D What I disagree about is the rating - I am 36 and I love this fragrance. I find it very versatile and while it might seem old fashioned and similar to the stuff from the 80\'s - to me this is a perfectly blended, timeless classic. It\'s fresh, floral, woody and earthy all at the same time. Maybe it\'s not something that stands out a lot, maybe not something that makes people say ""wow"" when they smell it for the first time. But for me it\'s a 10/10, perfect signature scent. But I\'m not saying that just to argue with someone or make you change your mind, it\'s highly subjective and everyone has their own taste. One man\'s trash is another man\'s treasure :) And this is where we come to the part where I 100% agree - always test, never fully trust reviews online. If I trusted the negative reviews, I would have never found this gem for myself.', ""Initial impressions from sample: I can't say any of the notes stand out except for a general floral, slightly sweet but fresh smell. Has a silky texture/feel to it. And has a noticeable clean vetiver drydown. Perfect for the office and for warm weather outdoors or just casual settings in general in warm weather. Nothing mind-blowing and so the price even on online discounters is definitely too much. I think you can find cheaper scents that offer a similar profile or serve a similar purpose (e.g. Acqua Di Parma Colonia Intensa has a similar feel to this fragrance except that it has a citrus opening and middle rather than a floral one)."", 'Smelling this from a vial sample on the back of my hand. In the search to try and find safer non church like heavy incense non-dense beast mode Amouages.... what comes to mind is Reflection man, Reflection 45 ( both EXCELLENT) and I researched more from the house. One name that came up was this fragrance Dia Man.  I agree with most of you who have said or use these words ""mature old man fragrance."" It\'s not to be malicious or derogatory. It\'s the exact smell. I\'m 53. I wouldn\'t wear this now. I would not wear this at 63. I wouldn\'t wear it at 73. Just not for me. It reminds me of my Dad\'s colognes that he used to wear that have that aftershave old Manish smell. It\'s unmistakable. You\'ll see for yourself if you try this sample. I would hate to throw this sample in the garbage, but I\'m not going to wear it. The good news? It\'s only a vial sample. Again to all beginners, go crazy with vial samples. Don\'t Blind buy. I will not give up on this house. I have Epic Man as we speak on the table. I tried it the other day it\'s not bad I have to wear it more. There are at least a handful of great scents from this house. Don\'t give up on Amouage if your new to this house. Sooner or later they\'ll hit a home run that you like. Scent : 4 Sillage: 6 Longevity: 8.5', 'Very old-school, dated scent, but it\'s done exceptionally well. In order to truly enjoy this, you have to avoid any mental associations to it being an ""old man"" scent. I had to rethink this myself, as it immediately reminded me of this old Vitalis hair tonic that my dad wore growing up. Once you move past that, you\'ll see that this is a classy, refined, professional scent, albeit a bit dated. Dia Man opens with mostly vetiver and peony accompanied by bitter orange. Some smokiness, labdanum, and woods eventually find their way in there, as well as a bit of powder. The vetiver and florals tend to stick around throughout the life of the fragrance. This is a mature masculine all the way.', 'Honestly, I was expecting worse from this. I say such a thing due to the fact that Amouage as a house so far has been rather odd to my nose. To be honest this is rather pleasant, its woody, sweet, floral and elegant. Not overbearing in any capacity, not too masculine, not too feminine either but rather a good combination. Its soft and attention grabbing due to it not being a traditional fragrance. I do truly like this one, worth buying but maybe so at a later date. As im smelling this, it kind of reminds me of my grandparents bathroom (not in a chemical manner but rather a wood cabinet with remnants of cleaning supply etched into the layers of the wood) at their old house, but not necessarily in a bad way, has a nostalgic nuance to it, at least to me personally.', 'This is like a proto-Timbuktu from L\'Artisan, here you have incense with peony+plum making a sort of ""mango"" note that is in Timbuktu. This is complex and elegant, very clean and a soft side of masculinity is displayed in this creation. Yet at the same time it is very interesting, you will see how many details this has actually. Brilliant. This along with Beach Hut, Reflection and Beloved Man shows that Amouage can go away from their heavy ambers and incense, and give us a different style that doesnt go away from their DNA.', '9/10 Gentlemen fragrance.', 'A nice smelling perfume. Like you‚Äôll literally think of a nice person when you smell this. It‚Äôs got great projection but it‚Äôs soft at the same time. Never overwhelms your nose. It starts off a little bright and soapy clean thanks to the citrus and vetiver but It‚Äôs mostly powdery, comforting and warm probably thanks to the amber and labdanum. Kinda reminds me of Terre D Hermes with the way the vetiver is used but just take away all the citrus from that and just leave the dry down part of it. It‚Äôs got a floral tinge to the powdery character which is probably the peony as it‚Äôs on of the main notes in this perfume for me and if you get closer, you can get a nice smooth smoky tone in there too but it‚Äôs mostly powdery on me. Got good longevity one me but it‚Äôs an Amouage so I expected that. Really nice perfume.', ""A very different Amouage from what you would expect. Dia Man is elegant, restrained, professional, understated, and has a silent confidence about it. The Peony note smells exactly like putting your nose to a Peony flower. Peony flowers aren't very fragrant and you have to put your nose very close, almost inside of the flower, to smell them. That is how this fragrance behaves. The florals combined with the vetiver and plum give it a woody sweetness that is beautifully balanced. This would be an awesome office scent. Spray more than you typically would and absolutely spray on clothing and you'll get whiffs often."", ""Straight off the bat, smells like handwash. That's really the only way to put it. Very much like a handwash or soap found at a nice resort or hotel. I was expecting the dry-down to drastically change the smell but I was dead wrong. Would not purchase a bottle of this especially considering the extortionate price (in my opinion)."", ""An incredible vetiver scent with better performance than it first seems.... I'm not a huge Bertie fan but this one is wonderful, and it doesn't smell like Guerlain Vetiver any more than any one vetiver scent smells like another. In fact I'd say this one is a lot more original than most. Perfect for a rainy, cold autumn day, to add a sparkle and shimmer to the grim, grey surroundings. Today it's raining constantly I Paris and I'm out and about, and this little gem is giving me a spritz of joy as I go between my meetings."", '#942 in my ""Tour de Fragrance"" An Amouage scent I would absolutely love if it performed better. Though I actually like the incense note in this enough that I almost don\'t care. Almost. It\'s half the price of Amouage ""Enclave"", my favorite from Amouage, but it\'s also half the sillage and longevity. You\'ll definitely need to reapply this at lunch as it\'s at the very low end of EDP potency. And you can get a pretty dead on clone of this from Fragrenza called ""Intimate Peony"" for $63. In it\'s favor it\'s an interesting and complex scent that I think is fine for any purpose in any setting involving a short engagement. As with most incense scents I\'d save it for cooler weather. This won\'t take the heat. I think it\'s car pool, elevator and tight office safe, but I\'d probably rely on this as a date night fragrance. If something hasn\'t happened in the three-fours before it becomes all but indetectable it probably isn\'t going to.', 'This is a wonderful mature fragrance that checks all of the boxes for a formal business scent and or a semi dressed up casual scent. Depending on your collection and or the price point... a 10ML will go a long way.', '8/10', 'Very good. Very elegant and slightly leathery. Business fragrance.', 'bring this back!', 'This is a very nice old-school soapy fresh floral scent profile that is very businessman esque. It also reminds me a soapy verison of 2-Man from CDG. Reserved for a mature audience.', 'I‚Äôm wearing this today & if it wasn‚Äôt applied heavily like I easily did, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd hate it, But it doesn‚Äôt do anything for me either. When most Amouages do! It sort of surprises me that it‚Äôs an Amouage & has me scratching my head why Bracken was axed & this one still remains?‚Ä¶The freshness or somewhat powdery feel of this one pretty much later on moves into the fougure territory, And I detect the addiction of leather in the dry down. Honestly reminds me of all those different Old Spice Body Sprays seems like damn near a hundred of them to choose from in a big grocery store or Walmart. I would never think that an Amouage would ever put a picture of a young man in my head wearing Rock Revival Jeans with all the rhinestones on the ass pockets with a western shirt & cowboy boots And all the mousse in his head is giving me a headache behind him in the checkout line! But it isn‚Äôt the perfume filled mousse. No it‚Äôs Dia Man that he took a bath in! I feel like I know because unloaded just half of my carded sample on me a couple hours ago & It‚Äôs a rather annoying! Go with Beach Hut Man. It‚Äôs similar to this one, But way more welcoming in my opinion', ""Soft, gently floral, lightly spicy and fruity sweet, calming, soapy clean, ambery, gentlemanly, with a touch of powdery barbershop orris, on a foundation of a perfectly balanced woody, slightly smoky vetiver that is always present but never dominates the composition unlike many vetivers I've tried. Gorgeous fragrance that I'd wear anytime, anywhere. One of those rare perfumes that is less a fragrance and more of an aura. The only fragrance it somewhat reminds me of is Zaharoff Signature. It shares many characteristics, although they are highly distinguishable. Zaharoff Signature is drier, less sweet, is not particularly floral to my nose, and is more noticably spicy, primarily due to its black pepper. That's a fragrance I enjoy and consider a strong signature, although its dry spiciness does fatigue me for daily wear. Dia Man is on another level for me, both in terms of appeal and wearability.  If you sample this one and it isn't a love at first sniff, please give it a few wears. I did not love it initially, but it has quickly become one of my top 5 fragrances and is my current signature scent. It may take a while before Dia Man reveals its complexity and unique appeal and wins you over."", ""I've been wanting this for a while and finally pulled the trigger. My 9th Amouage. It's definitely a good one. I would say 30 yo+. Classy scent. It seems subtle because it's not super sweet, powdery, or has enough incense to be comparable to Interlude. Good for 70 degrees+, or in the office. Signature scent worthy. 6+ hours, arms length projection. It has some Jubilation vibes. A little dirty, a little sweet, a little clean."", ""Lovely smoky vetiver that's contrasted by soapy pink florals. Mediocre performance"", 'This one worked really well for me. From a generous sample and three days of wear over 3 weeks I got 8+ hours of length each day with great projection throughout. Citrus and white floral opening. Complex with some spiciness. Really lovely. Vetiver comes about 30 minutes in. Very soft and green. Woody dry down is warm, rich but not overwhelming. Lovely scent. Well complimented at office. Certainly worthy of FB consideration.', 'I have a bottle of this available for swap. Pre-reformulation.', ""I don't understand why so many comments emphasise that DIA is masculine... Gentle, soft, delicate, creamy (i mean the nivea cream vibe)...  If that is masculinity it has to be a man in pink sweater, slim jeans and with purse, which he has to carry to be a good boy for his lady. Yuck. Anyway it is nice floral, pleasant scent.

I wore it as my scent of the day and applied liberally before heading to work. The first couple of hours were fairly enjoyable. The fragrance is powdery, floral, soft and pretty. Unfortunately, by hour five the fragrance had all but disappeared. Dia is non-offensive and works well in an office setting. However, a midday re-application will be necessary. One of the weaker fragrances in my collection.', ""It smells very smooth, hard to pick out any single notes. For some reason it reminds me of the older stuff like Boss Number One but it's way softer and doesn't have that urinal cake vibe if you know what I mean... A bit of sweetness, some flowers, spices and wood - perfectly balanced for my taste. It's quite classy but at the same very versatile, good for any occasion or time of year/day.  Not a safe buy though, if you're a younger guy or more into the modern fragrances, this might not be for you. The only bad thing I have to say about this is the performance.

It‚Äôs neutered and pretty underwhelming (even for a standard designer fragrance). For a vetiver fragrance, you can do much better with the Encre Noire series than with this one.

I am a big amouage fan and so far I have 8 bottles from the house and to me this does not behave or feel like an amouage. Edit: After further testing, my initial thoughts are still intact about Dia. I get a woody feel through and through but it does not have any wow factor. It is a 1 - dimensional fragrance. There are many fragrances that does vetiver better than this one.', 'Quick notes: Dry down vetiver is very similar to guerlain Vetiver.', 'Smells like the barber shop, but in a nice mature elegant way.

Please feel free to DM me.', ""This is an exceptional perfume. Deep and top notch quality. Personaly I would not wear it anywhere outside my house though. Very difficult to pull this off, as mentioned by others before me, especialy if you are under 50 years old.  It is office safe only in the sense that it's not a projection monster, otherwise it is not even remotely a scent someone would expect to smell in an office or other professional enviroment. For me it is not suitable for day wear either. From time to time it gives me vibes of Chanel no5 or similar very mature lady scents. Overall it is a great perfume but just not my cup of tea. I can enjoy and apreciate it nevertheless."", 'This is my second bottle of D√≠a Man, I previously purchased a 100ml bottle based on numerous recommendations, but ended up selling it as I couldn‚Äôt make up my mind whether or not I liked it. Last week I bought a 50ml and here are some thoughts: - It smells mature and not in a good way, a timeless classic this is not. This opens sweet (sweet orange, honey plum), but along side the sweetness there is a spiciness that balances it out. - The sweetness isn‚Äôt cloying or synthetic, there are tons of high quality naturals here. This is a riff on French perfumery from the 70s, very elegant and clean, not too loud.  - Dries down to Vetiver and leather with a spicy overtone and a mild sweetness. There are layers and details in the fragrance, but this is not an easy wear. I kept hearing that this is super versatile and office safe, but unless your office is located at Roja Dove‚Äôs marketing headquarters, I don‚Äôt see how anyone under the age of 65 can pull this off with a straight face.', 'Got a new batch and it doesn‚Äôt work on my skin. Didn‚Äôt find it to project extremely well and it just smells like the soap you would find in a gas station bathroom. Really a shame based on the reviews I read on older batches!', ""I was wearing this about 10 years ago. It had a deep, warm, floral incense-y aura that lasted quite a few hours with a reasonable sillage. It was my office scent, very discreet, calm and elegant.  A few years later I got hold of an official Amouage sample and I was shocked by how different, soapy, light, lavender-like shaving foam it smelled. I visited Amouage's store in London and my suspicion was confirmed, this has been reformulated. When I asked the sales assistants they wouldn't give me a straight answer. Nonetheless, I still had some juice left in the old bottle and compared it to their latest sample - this is no longer the perfume it used to be. They pretty much killed it. What a shame... and a hard pass."", ""The perfect gift for CEOs! If you're  into classy scent , classic elegant woody fragrances check this one."", 'Depending on my mood, this fragrance often takes the lead among my Amouage favorites, alongside Reflection Man and Imitation Man. Though not typically described as a young man‚Äôs scent, it surprisingly works for me, evoking memories of my younger, more innocent days when I relished the scent of my dad‚Äôs favorite shaving foam. Official notes won‚Äôt reveal this nostalgic aroma, and it took me a while to pinpoint it. My best guess is the combination of the iris (orris root) and an unmentioned lavender note. TOP NOTES What I get is this wonderful combination of zesty but not bitter orange, combined with the most realistic peony flower. Both modern and traditional which is hard to accomplish. I do not detect the leathery labdanum throughout the composition along with cardamom which are probably here as supporting notes. HEART NOTES The elegant dance of fragrant notes continues into the middle stage, introducing lavender and iris. Orris, derived from the iris root, adds a powdery, and slightly soapy barbershop elegance that enhances the fragrance‚Äôs depth. While plum is often touted as a dominant note, in my case, it‚Äôs almost non-detectable. Living in a region abundant with plums, I can confidently say not to expect much plum presence. BASE NOTES In the drydown, Omani frankincense stands out like no other ‚Äî the best in the world, with nothing else even coming close. How the perfumer made it elegant and just right without being overpowering is a feat in itself. Vetiver, another key player in the base, contributes a smooth and woody character, grounding the fragrance with depth, accompanied by the subtlest rose I‚Äôve encountered. Dia was designed to be an entire experience, not just a scent where you detect a couple of prominent notes and call it a day. OVERALL A fragrance exuding nuanced sophistication, Dia stands as an underrated gem seldom discussed in contemporary fragrance discourse. In my perspective, Dia not only stands out but also offers commendable value within its mostly unique scent DNA. Considered a masterpiece by my standards, Dia remains a scent that warrants sampling before a full commitment, despite being a staple in my collection and aligning with my personal preferences and priorities. Read the full review at scentgrail.com', ""Super weak, watered down. Abysmally soft. I'm talking minutes here. Spray and poof just disappears. I believe that's on the current batches that are coming out ofcourse. This version doesn't even allow you to get a glimpse of what this could've smelled like when it first came out. Never had such an experience with this house, most of the others that I've tried are undoubtedly great performers. Anyway, what has to be noted is that the nose behind this, Bertrand Duchaufour, is someone that's made stunning, complex and complete fragrances over the years and deserves all the respect he gets. However Dia Man broke my high expectations, and I would love to believe that it's a one off out of all the others in his portfolio. To try and describe this from it's short fleeting lifespan, it's a faint blend of spiced fresh bitter orange with cumin type of accord, incense and masculinely done florals with thin woodsy vetiver, that is what I get, DNA reminiscent of YSL Kouros. If you can try to breathe in a moment of that, and have high regard for the house of Amouage, then please go ahead and try for yourself. 6/10"", 'How can you tell if the bottle is vintage ? Also, si there such a big difference ? Thanks for any advice.', 'IT. Amouage Dia Man: Un Viaggio Olfattivo senza Paragoni All‚Äôapertura della scatola di Amouage Dia Man, non si pu√≤ fare a meno di notare l‚Äôeleganza pura che promette. E con la prima inalazione, si avverte immediatamente che questa promessa √® stata mantenuta. La fragranza si apre con un‚Äôaccattivante mistura di Incenso e Cardamomo, che evoca un senso di mistero e avventura. Questo viene ulteriormente esaltato dalle note di Labdano e Arancia Amara, che aggiungono un tocco di freschezza vibrante e un sottile pizzico di agrume. Mentre la fragranza si sviluppa, emergono le note di cuore, con la delicata Peonia e la dolcezza succulenta della Prugna, che fanno da contrasto al terroso Rizoma di Iris e all‚Äôopulento Ylang Ylang. Questo bouquet floreale e fruttato crea una sensazione di lusso senza pari, come passeggiare in un giardino mediterraneo al tramonto. E come ogni grande storia ha un finale indimenticabile, anche Dia Man non delude. Le note di fondo sono un trionfo di profondit√† e carattere. Il Vetiver e il Legno di Rosa Brasiliano offrono una base legnosa, mentre l‚ÄôAmbra e il Patchouli aggiungono calore e persistenza. Il tocco finale di Cuoio conferisce un senso di mascolinit√† raffinata. Amouage Dia Man √®, senza dubbio, una fragranza per chi apprezza l‚Äôarte della profumeria. Un tributo all‚Äôeleganza, alla complessit√† e alla bellezza delle essenze pi√π pregiate. Quando lo indossi, non sei solo avvolto da un profumo, ma vivi una vera e propria esperienza e anche se questo profumo √® stato creato pi√π di 20 anni fa, il suo fascino non √® affatto diminuito. Al contrario, come un vino pregiato che migliora con gli anni, Amouage Dia Man ha acquisito una maturit√† che intensifica la sua innata eleganza e sofisticatezza. La sua longevit√† nel mondo della profumeria testimonia non solo la maestria con cui √® stato creato, ma anche la sua capacit√† di affascinare e sedurre generazione dopo generazione.

Amouage Dia Man: An Unparalleled Olfactory Journey Upon opening the box of Amouage Dia Man, one can‚Äôt help but notice the sheer elegance it promises. And with the first inhalation, it becomes immediately evident that this promise has been fulfilled. The fragrance opens with an alluring blend of Frankincense and Cardamom, evoking a sense of mystery and adventure. This is further enhanced by notes of Labdanum and Bitter Orange, adding a touch of vibrant freshness and a subtle hint of citrus. As the fragrance unfolds, the heart notes emerge, with the delicate Peony and the succulent sweetness of Plum contrasting the earthy Orris Root and the opulent Ylang Ylang. This floral and fruity bouquet creates a sense of unparalleled luxury, like walking through a Mediterranean garden at sunset. And as every great story has an unforgettable ending, Dia Man does not disappoint. The base notes are a triumph of depth and character. Vetiver and Brazilian Rosewood provide a woody foundation, while Amber and Patchouli add warmth and longevity. The final touch of Leather imparts a sense of refined masculinity. Amouage Dia Man is, without a doubt, a fragrance for those who appreciate the art of perfumery. A tribute to elegance, complexity, and the beauty of the finest essences. When you wear it, you‚Äôre not just enveloped in a scent, but you‚Äôre living a true experience. And even though this perfume was created over 20 years ago, its allure has not diminished in the slightest. On the contrary, like a fine wine that improves with age, Amouage Dia Man has acquired a maturity that intensifies its innate elegance and sophistication. Its longevity in the world of perfumery attests not only to the mastery with which it was created but also its ability to enchant and seduce generation after generation. Wearing Dia Man today is like forming a bond with a rich and lush past, yet feeling modern, relevant, and always in the spotlight. Ultimately, it‚Äôs proof that true beauty and art are timeless.', ""This perfume blends so well that it's difficult to pick one note. It's the utmost refinement of floral and woody notes. The dry-down is soapy and slightly powdery. The man who wears this fragrance is friendly, and kind.  8/10"", ""Horribly reformulated. I've survived off of older carded samples for years and just recently purchased a newer bottle (I think it's a 2021 or 2022). The older samples start off with a wonderfully airy incense, vetiver and plum combo that I've grown to love. The new version starts off with cardamom, that's it, just a huge cardamom blast. It'll eventually settle down to resemble the older version but it's thinner and lighter.  I've had one spray of each version on each hand and had my wife and mom smell them about an hour after spraying, they both agree that they're similar but that the older formulation is richer and smells better. So for me that settles the performance debate I've seen on here for years. The old version, while still light and modest, performs reasonably well for what it does. Whereas the modern reformulation can only be described as weak and impotent.  Amouage really took a shit when Christopher Chong left and I've smelled a lot of their fragrances pre and post reformulation I can confidently say this has been the worst one by far. And for amouage to deny any reformulations is just malicious gaslighting, there's no denying their reforms and I'll never buy a new bottle from them again."", ""Completely underrated, perhaps because it doesn't have the oomph that some of the other amouages have but make no mistake this stuff is goergous. I get a beautiful soft soapy powdery woody smell that is softened with light resins,warm spices and delicate florals. It may not be powerful but it does last on my skin all day. It creats such a classy posh clean light aura. So easy to wear anytime anywhere without giving it much thought. Of course, being an amouage you get high qaulity ingredients and sublime blending. Overall I place this in my top 5 amouages and very psyched to finally have a full bottle of this beauty."", 'Soft lightly spiced, and powdery. Elegant and sit close to the skin.', 'Smells like my elderly aunties. Smells good though.', 'Beautiful scent. This is definitely one of the best from Amouage for men although it does not have the typical 2000s era, Amouage DNA in it that we all know of, although this is one of the original ones created and sold in the United States.  Very mature, grown up, very versatile in its presentation of scent, as it is a very soft blend with all the notes in it meshed harmoniously without any one particular note standing out or imabalanced. The florals is however the base of the fragrance.  This is definitely an elegant man, very masculine, due to the woody tie-in with the florals. A modern woman (whatever that means) can definitely wear this, if she sees herself so. I wouldn\'t picture anyone younger than 25 wearing this.  This is a great scent for the day time for a nice outing to a museum, to the office, to a convention, etc, something conservative indoors but during the daytime. This scent is not for the club or a concert as it will drown out in an evironment like that. For outdoors, I can see a situation of a yacht club scenario. Being out in a boat (not a rowboat, or outdoors activity style/kayaking) with your linen attire perhaps having a cocktail chatting with others. This is a mild social event fragrance. I typically spray two or three times and it will linger for several hours. The sillage however is very close to the skin. I dont think for a scent like this and its purpose, it needs to project any more than that. You\'ll see what I mean if you smell this on yourself. It is used purposefully when dressed well, and to be accessorized softly near your skin.  It is a discrete scent if you want it to in how you apply it. Demure but confident. This is one of my favorites in all my collection. There is a slight ""designer"" nuance to this. However that may be positive or negative, it is there. It is very wearable, friendly, and people will be receptive if they get close enough to notice it on you. Presentation is always the best, I cant expect less from Amouage; they always hit it out of the park with their bottles and box presentation. For the fragrance alone, not considering its price or value, and for what is up my alley, I give this an 8.7.', 'Am I losing my mind or is there a cumin note in this? Confirmed: I‚Äôm losing my mind.', 'Recently I managed to get a vintage sample set of Amouage gold, Silver, Dia and Ciel man (this is the vintage dagger bottle version). I thought of sharing my experience so that it might help those who wish to expend big cash on a vintage bottle of your favourite Amouage thinking vintage is even better. Actually I was more interested about Dia man as it‚Äôs my all time favourite. Dia happen to be the least different perfume from new version, difference is almost negligible. May be vintage Dia has more fruity plum and presence of leather, wee bit richer, darker in the opening. Other than that not much difference. Performance wise same, still a laid back and have an average longevity. I don‚Äôt see any reason to spend big money on a vintage, however the vintage dagger bottle look fantastic, so if I found a good deal then I will buy, just for the bottle.', ""@filiplerch, same here.

I cannot smell anything. I have tried few samples, also tried it in a store, but exept very weak vetiver, there is nothing. I can say, that if somebody wants to smell nothing get this.

I let go of Amber even though I liked it because it leaned feminine to me and I wasn‚Äôt wearing it. This seemed to have a more masculine feel in the sample, but have to say it leans more feminine now that I had a proper spray/wear of it.  Not sure I want this one now (just got a decant luckily), and actually might like the Amber better. It was one I missed a little and had more pop, and don‚Äôt always mind a slight lean of femininity to a frag, but I don‚Äôt see me reaching for it very often. Especially since it‚Äôs also not very work friendly in my particular work environment.  Too bad, it does smell nice. I just think it‚Äôs not for me.', ""I love this but performance is just terrible.

Save your money for any other Amouage. This is a pass for me. If you doubt, try before you buy. New : I got a tester bottle for a steal and i totally adore it.

Floral, woody and slightly fruity the combination makes for such a pleasant cologne. Becoming harder to find but also much cheeper, just the other day I was about to pull the trigger on a bottle for $200 when most fragrances from Amouage are going for 4-$500. Decided to revisit my 2ml vial to see if I wanted it which lead me to think it wasn‚Äôt for me, but also lead me to really appreciate this one so much more and having it on my hand all day, smelling the entire spectrum of this fragrance, I came to realize what a masterpiece this one is.

I honestly did not expect such floral fruitiness from a fragrance marketed to men, but I\'m super pleased by it. I guess I shouldn\'t be too surprised, though... Amouage definitely seems to release either hyper-masculine scents, or ones that bend in the middle a bit (Gold Man, for example). I won\'t say that this smells fruity floral the whole way, it\'s just a fun little twist. Past this opening, it becomes much more powdery and woodsy. The orris root just makes this pop. I\'m in love.

If this is Dia Man, what it might be Dia Woman !?', '@shinobi407fla4e can you explain me how could Amouage Dia Man (released in 2002) have taken inspiration from Prada Amber pour Home (released in 2006)???ü§î', 'Peony is the main player here. There are more masculine notes to try and offset the ""floweryness"" but to my nose this could only be pulled off by a man 60+ or a woman 30+. Seems well made but the flowery note makes this a pretty hard pass for me. It\'s just okay.', ""This juice blew me away. This is what Prada Amber Pour Homme should have been. This is truly the masculine version of that fragrance. Very soapy and clean. Prada Amber Pour Homme sells like a $200 bar of soap and is too feminine for my liking but it is a beautiful fragrance. Dia Man adds a clean but a little bit earthy vetiver, a herbal patchouli, and a noticeable incense note which mans up and kills the femininity you get from the florals. This juice is GORGIOUS and undoubtedly masculine. I do think Amouage took inspiration from Prada but they made it better and made it masculine. This is a 10/10 and a standing ovation for me. Well done Amouage. Update: I was informed that That Dia Man was released before Prada Amber Pour Homme. So, I stand corrected about Amouage taking inspiration from Prada. It's the other way around."", 'Quiet and confident. Beautiful fragrance. Blind bought it based on A.C ""smells good"" reviews on youtube. Elegant and versatile. When you need to slow down and reflect over your life, spray some sprays of Dia Man. Sit down and just be present. Thats what Dia man is to me. A quiet, gentle and loving reminder when you need to slow down the tempo of the world.  Best regards Olly', 'I‚Äôm a big fan of this fragrance for what it is. A lot of feedback I see, I believe there is an expectation of another Amouage powerhouse, which this is not. In my opinion, I would put this as a top, solid choice for an office fragrance. It is clean, has a solid depth, smells classy and rich, and is light to not stand out or choke people out in an office setting. To me, I wear this when I want to smell clean, professional, polished, with status. I work from home, however this is my #1 choice if I have to go for a business trip or rare occasion going to the office. I typically wear this for myself, at home. Again, leans more on the subtle side, not big on projection, but I feel clean and confident when I wear it.', ""I first tried Dia during a week long Amouage sampling binge and it is perhaps the reason I was initially pretty disappointed with it - it definitely doesn't feel challenging in the slightest and I honestly wasn't ready for an Amouage fragrance that feels cozy, easy-going and almost safe. I have used it a few times since and while I did learn to enjoy it in it's own way, I admit I rarely find myself in the mood for it's gentle soapy floral notes. As many have stated before,the most interesting part is the opening (as opposed to most Amouages, might I add) which blends spicy cardamom scent with distinctly citrusy notes (my initial guess was tangerine actually), making it feel suprisingly refreshing for it's profile. The opening is super brisk though and it's followed by a fruity, flowery combo that while not being particularly challenging, is pleasant enough, reminiscent perhaps of a spring garden or orchard. Unfortunately the longevity is kinda underwhelming and I really don't care much for what this fragrance has to offer during the dy-down.... It's pretty much you run-of-the-mill vetiver which feels creamy, combined with floral notes even perhaps soapy feel which I initially found a bit disappointing after the freshness of the opening notes. It doesn't smell bad tho and it does feel like a really inoffensive, office smell which is exactly how I have been using it after my initial test. It preforms reasonably well but again lags behind it's Amouage siblings. All in all, it's a pleasant scent especially fitting for those, who find the more edgy Amouages too much to handle, but I honestly don't think it's a scent I'd be willing to pay the Amouage price for."", ""Not my favorite amouage! It's a pleasant, easy to wear floral-vetiver scent but nothing too impressive. I get a soapy clean vibe, the vetiver gives also a green aspect. The orris and the peony flower give a buttery floral effect with some fruitiness from the plum and some spicy sweet cardamon. It's linear and the only change is on the drydown it becomes more dark with the incense but still not heavy like other amouage fragrances. Performance is ok but not in amouage's stantards, i get about 7 hours longevity and soft projection. It's one of the most versatile of the brand, i find it unique and easy to like. It's an everyday, office friendly and possible signature scent. Overall, i am not impressed. This is the most meh and boring fragrance i smelled from this house. Reflection, Journey and Beach hut have this versatility and are way better fragrances overall! If you like vetiver and you search for something easy to wear and pleasant, try it!"", ""A pleasant slightly sweet soapy-floral fragrance. I would however be more happy if the opening notes (especially the cardamom and incense) would take longer and evolve even further into incense-spiciness. However, the fragrance quite quickly transforms into safe gentleman territory. The fragrance stays like this till the end in my opinion, the base notes function as the backbone (especially the woods and vetiver are noticeable) but do not dominate the whole. The projection and longevity (6-7 hours) are medium, but quite weak compared to the other Amouages I know. Still need to try it in the spring/summer season though. This fragrance is perfect for the work/office environment and to make a good first impression because it's so inoffensive, but still it does smell like quality."", ""Based on the notes, I should hate this. I hate vetiver-based fragrances. I hate cardamom in fragrances. I dislike peony as a note. I'm not the biggest fan of incense, unless blended well. I also don't care about ylang-ylang..... SO WHY DO I LIKE THIS SCENT?!?!? It doesn't make any sense....but I do... I like it :) The first fragrance I don't understand, and that's surprisingly, a good thing."", 'A fairly polite and inoffensive scent from Amouage. I imagine an elegant and mature man wearing this. It is powdery and exudes maturity. Nice offering.  8/10', ""One of the lesser Amouage creations if you ask me. I mostly get a dry, almost bitter vetiver and a faint, dusty floral accord. I'm not sure if it's the peony or plum pairing, but it's very dry and nondescript. Some smoke is added and a sprinkle of cardamom and woods. Not the most interesting composition and I fail to see how, even though this was released back in 2002, it could go up against Amouage's more popular or revered releases. At the end of the day, it's mostly a dry vetiver scent with some faint floral and semi-sweet smoky accords, but that's about it. A smell which will perhaps please a more mature audience. Performance is questionable. I do get some whiffs during the first 45-60 minutes, but it turns into a skin scent rather quickly. Perfect for the office or formal settings. It may be one of Amouage's underrated scents, but in my opnion it's for good reason. 6/10"", 'I‚Äôve been testing Dia Man for a while. Every time I smell it, it makes me think of my dad. No, he has never worn this before. It just smells like the lightest and most airy version of Ralph Lauren Polo in the green bottle. That‚Äôs the easiest way for me to explain what I‚Äôm smelling. I‚Äôm not speaking blasphemy. I‚Äôve been smelling Polo since January of 1988. So I know that fragrance very well.  I bought my mom a bottle of Dia Woman for Christmas because it was a love at first sniff for her. Its masculine counterpart seems perfect for my dad. It‚Äôs so perfect that I want to get him a bottle of it without a special occasion besides being my dad. Not only do I think the juices smell good, but the presentation is top notch also. I love gifting people things that I know are going to be used while still being aesthetically pleasing.  I‚Äôll update if i can find better words to explain this fragrance.', 'Soft, sophisticated, elegant, slightly sweet & soapy freshness. Spraying 4 times and it surrounds me with a beautiful cloud for 6 hours in the morning. High versatility as it doesn‚Äôt have the heavy amouage dna; same as beloved , silver & reflection.', ""A criminally underrated Amouage, this is so smooth and elegant. Probably Amouage's 2nd most designer-like scents, with Reflection Man in first place"", 'Clean elegant gentleman in a bottle, luxury classic soapy texure with oriantal smell and some sophistication,very good performance with soft gentle sillage, floral fruity and woody with a slight dash of sweetness, cardomon and smokyness noticeable but like a shadow, if it was a bit denser could be a very good signature scent all year. Dia ""a shine‚Äù Fits summer time and more for spring imo.', ""On my skin, I get a short-lived blast of incense. Right afterwards, a strong cardamom takes the lead, that might indeed - like the previous reviewer said - remind of mid-range designer fragrances, like YSL La Nuit de L'Homme. In the drydown, I get creamy florals supported by a blurry damp/airy/woody note. A very nice salty vetiver will appear in the late drydown, but I'm not willing to wait so long to enjoy a fragrance unfortunately. Good, but for sure not $340 good especially considering its performance, which stands on the lower side - a no go at that price level. I was expecting more from the hype, but honestly I'm disappointed, and and the late drydown is not enough for me to recommend it, not even at discounter pricing. Just my opinion.

The upper sheet of perfume is too short (3 -2 minutes) and after this step; Initially, the smell of clear roots is clear and then the plum. Here is the scent of Boy to 70 percent similar to the Olfactio Studio - Chamber. But the life of this smell, too short and a fragrance, is a little bit of a fragrance, which is a special bitterness in that. Just smell, at this stage, we still see the combination of the three outcomes that are ongoing at one time: the root of a particular smell and bitterness, especially itself; The plum and its rich state of its perfume, as well as the boom that aroma, is my point of view. It seems that you look at the sea; Not from the beach that you see wave. But from the middle of the sea that does not see a wave and the sea looks so arom. The scent of Dia after 15 minutes created a sensory in me. From here, there is a fragrance to its sophisticated stage. It seems that before the first quarter of the notes were fighting and controversy, and no one with each other. But after a quarter, each one can make themselves; Finally, they are agreed together and they have been together (the overall perfume chords) and create a very lovely smell. So hard to describe this odor. But perhaps he said that at this stage the general smell of perfume; A combination of nation, plus plum. A bitterness is also seen behind these two. This bitterness is not at first, but it's too low to average.

One of my top 5, and Amouage #1. Dia Man came out 18 years ago, in 2002. So the soapy aldehydes are of that era in perfumery. The turn of the millennium, was the beginning of modern era. In the 1990\'s, mens frags were getting out of the powerhouse era, and soapy aldehydes were used more, as in YSL Jazz and Kouros. Dia man is timeless and mostly modern, but it has a touch of classic vib. My favorite reviewer is Colin Maillard, not his real name. He is Italian who works as a translator to English. So his writing is exquisite, and he\'s so perceptive when comes to fragrances. 1,000 of reviews, mostly now on Basenotes. I remember reading his review of Dia 5 years ago. He gave 10/10. And he raved about it as ""Creative artistic"" which he hated to say about fragrances. It was discontinued back then, now rediscovered and blind buy purchased. Memoir Man was my favorite Amouage, and I like the Blue Beast for icy cold. Dia is my #1 Amouage now.  I don\'t care for most Amouage, they are harsh and cold, except Lyric and Reflection perhaps. Dia has creative accords, lush florals with spicy/ earthy Oriental notes. It reminds me of GUERLAIN classics. I love the Guerlain Parisian collection, Derby, Chamade, Voyou, Dandy... Dia was given as an alternative to the discontinued Lupin Dandy, my favorite in series. This does smell like it could belong in Guerlain Parisian classic series. Dia is more modern, but has the subtle beautiful, yes creative accords that Guerlain classics have. A YouTube reviewer said Dia is creamy. I think he meant warm spicy snd soft. The soft florals and powdery oris give it softness, the bitter orange, plum blossom, and dry incense give some balance. I would say, it very slightly leans masculine, but mostly gender neutral perhaps. Dia is the most unlike the rest, of Amouage fragrances.  The cardomom is a main player. The oris makes it a bit powdery. I like the opening when the florals are strongest, some may think, a slight lean feminine at this point. The florals settle, yet remain in accords. Enough for now... This may be my last review. I am trying to stop adding fragrances, as I now have a large, complete mostly niche collection, about 100. Its hard to quit, but being a Christian I have grace from God. If you have Christ as your Savior, He can become your all. You can overcome anything through Him.

I dont want to bag Amouge (they obviously make quality juice), but I cannot for the life of me enjoy what they offer. So dank, fecael, spice market, dry, bitter, unbalanced, aggressive, unwearable. A true niche brand where their niche market is definitely aimed for their region. EXCEPT THIS! Amazing scent. I will go on record and say that its one of the greatest fresh offerings I have ever smelt from any house. so elegant, complex, sophisticated, regal, clean. this i can imagine a prince wearing in the heat of summer in Oman.  A freshy with depth, complexity, crispness and transition. Not linear at all. If you want the most grown up, royal hot day scent, this has to be the one for you.

Many in the community dismiss it as it‚Äôs not loud like some other Amouages. This is a scent that wouldn't work if it was dialled up to 11. It‚Äôs very classy and refined.

It‚Äôs the projection and sillage that are soft. Opens up with peony, plum, and incense. The peony does not make this feminine in any way, on the contrary I find this a masculine scent. The heart and dry down are really where Dia man shines. The florals and fruits die down and you are left with a soft incensey vetiver scent; it‚Äôs gorgeous. There‚Äôs something about the dry down that feels quite barbershop to me (which I love), but this isn‚Äôt a typical barbershop scent. Give this one a try if you want to portray elegance.

I love Dia and I think it is very underated due his big loud and extraordinaryly beautiful family member.

Another thing worth adding is that Dia is a rather western style perfume. Yes, it's soapy, but imagine a bath in a soap which brings a smile, tranquility and purifies your senses.

This one is a good take on vetiver, with a kind of creamy plum and just a tiny bit soapy floral tone over the top of the dry slightly mossy wood smell distinctive to vetiver. Doesn‚Äôt smell like Bal D‚ÄôAfrique but if you understand how that relates to vetiver you can understand the vibe of this one too (although this is more masculine).

So his writing is exquisite, and he\'s so perceptive when comes to fragrances. 1,000 of reviews, mostly now on Basenotes. I remember reading his review of Dia 5 years ago. He gave 10/10. And he raved about it as ""Creative artistic"" which he hated to say about fragrances. It was discontinued back then, now rediscovered and blind buy purchased. Memoir Man was my favorite Amouage, and I like the Blue Beast for icy cold. Dia is my #1 Amouage now.  I don\'t care for most Amouage, they are harsh and cold, except Lyric and Reflection perhaps. Dia has creative accords, lush florals with spicy/ earthy Oriental notes. It reminds me of GUERLAIN classics. I love the Guerlain Parisian collection, Derby, Chamade, Voyou, Dandy... Dia was given as an alternative to the discontinued Lupin Dandy, my favorite in series. This does smell like it could belong in Guerlain Parisian classic series. Dia is more modern, but has the subtle beautiful, yes creative accords that Guerlain classics have. A YouTube reviewer said Dia is creamy. I think he meant warm spicy snd soft. The soft florals and powdery oris give it softness, the bitter orange, plum blossom, and dry incense give some balance. I would say, it very slightly leans masculine, but mostly gender neutral perhaps. Dia is the most unlike the rest, of Amouage fragrances.  The cardomom is a main player. The oris makes it a bit powdery. I like the opening when the florals are strongest, some may think, a slight lean feminine at this point. The florals settle, yet remain in accords. Enough for now...

I have begun to really enjoy plum and plum blossom notes in fragrances, and here it offers a sweetness and fruitiness which is perfectly paired by the exotic ylang-ylang and powdery orris. Finally, the rich leather, patchouli, palisander (rosewood) and vetiver base notes arrive and provide a deep earthiness. This is definitely not a quiet, timid, or subtle scent...

At first spray, I felt an intensity of masculine, boss like energy. The combination of agrestic rosemary, bitter citrus peels, and earthy vetiver speak of a man who dominates a boardroom. The oud here showcases so many facets of the natural material, although it is synthetic. It seems somewhat astringent, akin to witch hazel water, yet animalic and leathery at the same time. It feels red, accompanied by molten, ambery, labdanum to increase this effect. To my nose, there is an unlisted note of iris-- in the powdery, talcum direction, similar to the finishing powder they use in barber shops. It adds a dignified, fresh, gentleman like quality to the composition, and cleans up the animalic edges of oud. In old descriptions of this fragrance pyramid, you would often find Mandrake root as a key note. To my nose, this is quite accurate and depicted well here.  I once tried Mandrake root as a tea to treat arthritis pains. I remember the scent of the unboiled roots so well: a mix between dried patchouli leaves, Palo Santo wood, and licorice root. I cherish this bottle as it is so nostalgic. It is 22 years old now. Yes, it has lost some of it's projection, and smells of rubbing alcohol and vinegar at first spray.

Created by the talented duo of Jacques Cavallier and Alberto Morillas, this Amber Woody masterpiece not only captures the essence of male sensuality but also represents a pinnacle of sophistication and craftsmanship. As the seventh men's perfume by YSL and the second collaboration with Tom Ford during his tenure as the creative director, M7 remains an iconic fragrance that has left an indelible mark on the world of luxury scents. It is with a sense of reverence and admiration that one approaches this olfactory symphony. The top notes of Rosemary, Mandarin Orange, and Bergamot set the stage for an olfactory journey that is both invigorating and refined. The crispness of citrus blends seamlessly with the herbal warmth of Rosemary, creating an opening that is as captivating as it is distinctive. The heart of M7 unfolds with the rich and exotic notes of Agarwood (Oud) and Vetiver. This composition exudes a deep, mysterious allure that speaks to the complexity of masculinity. The interplay of these notes is masterfully executed, showcasing the perfumers' ability to balance intensity with subtlety. The foundation of M7 rests upon the timeless combination of Amber and Musk. These base notes bring a sensuous and lingering quality to the fragrance, leaving an unforgettable trail that resonates with both confidence and sophistication. It is disheartening to write bad reviews for recent disappointments with the brand's newest releases, as expressed in your review. However, let M7 stand as a reminder of Tom Ford's ability to create olfactory masterpieces that transcend time and trends. Perhaps, in time, the brand will return to the heights of elegance and excellence that it once embodied. Until then, let us celebrate the enduring legacy of M7 as a symbol of what Tom Ford and YSL achieved when they were creating with passion and dedication."", 'Hi, Animal scent, warm, shocking for some, spacious, women are not indifferent to it, durability 12 hours, projection 4 hours, masterpiece', 'ÿßŸàŸÑ€åŸÜ ÿπÿ∑ÿ±€å ⁄©Ÿá ⁄Üÿ¥ŸÖ ÿ®ÿ≥ÿ™Ÿá ÿÆÿ±€åÿØŸÖ €åŸá ÿ¥ÿßŸá⁄©ÿßÿ± ÿ®€å ÿ™⁄©ÿ±ÿßÿ±', ""M7, the original blend has a masculine character that is powerful yet sophisticated, intoxicating, yet emphatic. Its articulation of masculinity is nuanced as seen through the interaction of the different elements of the blend and the blend itself is masterly. It's a matter of public record that Tom Ford's development and release of this fragrance was bold, bold in the sense that the western market was not familiar with Oud, despite its cultural power throughout Arabian culture. Thus, the use of Oud in M7 original was subtle, just enough to convey its mystique, but compared to most middle eastern blends of Oud, its use is toned down. I note that other posters here have commented at length about the idea of masculinity in relation to this development and how it has changed since the development of M7. I think some of the intellectualising around masculinity can descend into cliche and navel gazing. In the late 90s/early 2000s when M7 was being developed, masculinity had begun to change in the West (not necessarily elsewhere) and had become less one dimensional - 10 years of no major conflicts involving NATO countries and the influence of more post-modern pop culture icons who drew inspiration from the likes of Bowie and Madonna's gender play helped a lot of men to feel more relaxed about what in fashion and grooming terms represented masculinity. Working class men in most of the 20th century had fought wars, built towns and cities and won sports achievements, not intellectual middle class guys. As a result, pop culture and masculinity was defined by working class men who portrayed themselves as stoic, resolute, strong and brave. Critiques of such a notion of masculinity aside, that way of portraying masculinity was borne out of circumstance as much as cultural mores. References to 80s masculinity wrapped up with cocaine use are cliched and not founded in reality. If you don't believe that go and speak to folks in their 60s and 70s and ask them how cheap cocaine was in the West in the 80s, it wasn't, it was a rich person's drug. Most men's grooming and fragrance habits in the 80s and 90s were pretty conservative, unlike now, as we live in a more liberated age. In that context, M7 was an outlier and arguably quite a highbrow fragrance for the mass market appeal of YSL. In essence, class affiliation still binds for the most part, the style of fragrances brought to market by large houses such as YSL. I agree with the idea by the way that you should just wear what you want (I also acknowledge that it is a view borne out of either boldness and self-possession, but more likely a middle class approach to life), but most working class folks would not subscribe to such a view. It is utterly bizarre that the term masculinity could be triggering or 'problematic' but cliches about toxicity aside, we do live in an age of mass confusion."", '@Ansary , where and how much ?', 'i have a full bottle not sealed dm if interested', ""This joint masterpiece by Morillas & Cavallier was ahead of its time.

Here goes: In the 80s the idea of masculinity was still transitioning from the idea of guy who had typified \'Manliness\' for generations from the start of the 30s, the kind of guy gut-punched first and then asked his wife when they were going to have boring sex later, into a guy who cleansed, toned and moisturised over the coke-OD\'d dead call-girl of the Yuppy riddled late 80s. The stars of yesteryear\'s silver screen still a presence and influence over many young boys and producers and creators to the point that any chance of representation was often a lazy imitation of the stars of the 40s, 50s and 60s. Masculinity was often represented as stony-faced, wide-legged, and monosyllabic. John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Steven Seagal - all have this \'tough guy\' pastiche and persona of masculinity, though, it does not say \'masculine\' to me; in my opinion its closer to parody - almost like they are affectations of masculinity is more so a reminder to themselves of what they think denotes ""being manly"". Masculinity doesn\'t advertise. \'Masculinity\' not a dirty word; I consider it a positive; I believe that as an aesthetic masculinity has been done a massive disservice; its either been diluted to a point of neutrality or aligned to the alt-right/inceldom/misogyny bullshittery. Like with femininity; masculinity has its own beauty which is often misinterpreted. I believe in balance; from an aesthetic point of view there needs to be both male and female elements for beauty (opinion not statute) to be realised. The (high) Renaissance knew this, Little Richard, David Bowie, Grace Jones, Rick James, Prince...shit even ""Gangsta"" Rappers and Drag Queens knew this! And Tom Ford knew this. I think fashion has the similar idea on the masculine aesthetic; though I think its always skewed it further possibly too much toward the \'feminine\'. I don\'t think there has been a celebration of \'the male\' since Tom Ford\'s at Gucci,YSL (and when his own brand launched). I think he was at his peak within this ten year period (watch the 1995 Gucci catwalk show - its akin to other iconic moments from the nineties). In this period he oversaw the production of two (out of the three what I think are the best male fragrances from YSL): Rive Gauche and M7. Both of these scents smell like the powerhouses of the early 80s late 70s. Tom Ford has often returned to this style of scent more often than in these two examples and its done to great effect- and they are celebrations of \'masculine beauty\'. Both these YSL scents have been discontinued for whatever reason (stupidity or trying to appeal to the mass non-fragcomm market I suspect), then both came back as part of some shallow marketing from YSL (La Collection) then discontinued again - yeah fuck you YSL. I got my hand on 10mls of the M7 reissue; and I love this thing! I missed this when it came out in the early 2000s. Regretfully. I cannot express how this stuff has catapulted itself into my \'Perfect 16\' curated collection. There is another \'flanker\' called M7 Oud Absolu - its such a lazy flanker that it is closer to being a close reformulation (which these La Collection issues really are). On the internet the notes from three different sites (Basenotes, Fragantica and Parfumo) are ranging from sparse to complex; though there is no mistaking the inclusion of Oud. But this is a typically western Oud, not the heavy \'medicinal/barnyard\' oud. Oud adjacent. There is a musk accord, a dry deep patchouli and an enveloping amber. The whole impression is this deep spicy red (for reference pantone 20-0076 tpm) that is at once warm and cold; the original bottle was a similar colour and a masterstroke by the bottle designer. I cannot speak on the projection or longevity as I could still smell it after a few hours (5-8) and I don\'t know if anyone could smell it on me as I don\'t care. As soon as my decant arrived I tested it in a strip, then did the \'cup thing\' (honestly look it up it works!) then I wore it for a whole day; I accidently sprayed some on my ear and jaw (slippy hands) It was a happy accident; as throughout the day it would waft from my head and I would really get a great impression of it. It\'s so deep of a scent yet not dark though there is an initial impression but like I said it is oddly vibrant though a dark vermillion. This is a sensual male scent it harks back to classics from the 70/80s, it is inherently masculine, very much \'male\' and it is reminds me of classical male beauty - probably because of the advertising. Looking at the advert, seeing the reclined nude male model is is reminiscent of classical art - male beauty is at the centre of representation. This is a scent for \'Men\' and by this (I\'m very prepared for the back lash from the \'wear what you like\' squad) I mean over a certain age - like old enough to wear a suit and not look like they were made to by their mother\'s, old enough to realise they are not the centre of the world; sorry but if you\'re a teenager or have to ask if this will get you compliments or \'can be worn to college\' don\'t bother this is a sweet tonka/vanilla compliment panty-dropper. Can women wear this - fuck yeaaa- but, think Jessica Chastain in \'Zero Dark Thirty\' than Bryce Dallas Howard in \'Black Mirror: Nosedive\'. This is the type of masculine I mean; it retains a rich and clear impression of masculinity that also has \'feminine elements\' that accentuate perfectly. It\'s masculinity without the sore bollock-waddle-walk of John Wayne, the constipated sneer of Dirty Harry or the flappy-armed girly-run of Steven Seagal. No macho-affectations. No this is Viv Richards at the crease, Edwin Moses at the start line, Ayrton Senna behind the wheel, Starbuck/Templeton Peck, Buck Rogers, Colt Seavers, Carl Weather\'s running on a beach...real masculinity, just doing their shit without fanfare of their \'manliness\'. 9.2/10', 'Would love to try this if anyone wants to sell a small OG decant.

All iterations of the scent are hard to find and opportunities to smell the scent are increasingly rare. I finally overpaid for a small decant of the 1st formulation (which then quickly sold out) and though it's cold comfort compared to a partial, I'm glad I have the chance to experience the scent. After all that effort, it would be a sin to leave the scent unreviewed, wouldn't it?  My immediate thought on first spray was that I was in for a good ride. There's an easy wearing quality and instant appeal from the opening. M7 really feels like a proto-Tom Ford scent. The scent is much sweeter than scents of its time, providing a soft sensual allure to the wearer. Like Tom Ford scents, it's unique, but follows relatively simple two-stage development. The scent starts with the prevalent sweetness of mandarin, supported by a light aromatic facet of sage/rosemary. The scent quickly evolves in a swirl of vinyl, musks and aromatics, helped along by an oud facet that evokes Oud Wood or Black Caviar. The oud here is nothing medicinal or barnyard, but instead adds a plasticky character that I constantly reference in a sub-genre of oud scents, where oud as a supporting character adds an alien character to what would otherwise be a typical scent. Here, as the scent tends towards musky ambrettolide, oud bolsters the richness of the musk and adds a butteriness that's hard to find in musky scents.  At this point in time, I couldn't be helped but reminded of Homme Parfum. DHP unquestionably references M7; both scents share common notes of sweet citrus, ambrette, oud, amber and a similar buttery, musky texture. In all my smelling, I haven't come across similar ambrette scents, which itself is a rare note. However, M7 feels like an accord of DHP, which adds on darkness, sweetness and complexity. Though unfair to compare the two, M7 does not stand up to its successor which by all metrics is harder, faster and stronger. M7 is not a projecting scent, instead providing a diffuse personal trail. The scent flits in and out throughout the day, and actually is hard to detect. Incredibly,12 hours later as I am typing in an ambient room, M7 is still here with me projecting diffuse sweet amber with light musk.  Ultimately, the story of M7 looms much larger than the scent itself. It smells great BUT doesn't have that same wow factor that DHP brings. Blind-buyers (with a large nest egg) won't regret M7 for its scent but for current market prices, better choices can be made through more modern alternatives."", ""im happy to have this in my collection finally. got the long red square bottle. managed to cop it for a price that doesn't cost and arm and leg. and i must say. its something. but not to over exaggerate it. initial opening of rosemary, bergamot and madarin. rosemary lingers a bit then immediately dries into a clean synthetic oud all the way with a very salty sweet warm musky amber. very base heavy you're gettin this till the end.  being one of the first introductions of oud into european markets you can really tell that it is bit rough around the edges. actually most of the things notes around it like vetiver seem there to be added to clean up the strong ambers and synthetic oud. its a great frag not too complex but just enough, master piece? up for debate.. i get some sort of faint sweet apricot wood accord prob cuz of what the amber does with the oud but there could be some vanilla in here. slightly animalic touch. hidden background powder used as a ''clean up'' note but you can't pick it up by itself. its of the silky variety giving it an overall very smooth and masculine effect.  it's nice. lasts long, projects. but i'll probably wear this very little since it's all i will probably ever get. i dont regret paying price. but from the amounts ive seen it listed for tbh it doesn't add up. as much as i love this, you can tell that middle eastern style introduction here was new. they did a great job with this. but it can come off medicinal cherry cough syrup at times. comparing this to like more modern takes of similar profiles, you're gonna miss that unique rough character but you will be getting smth lot more refined and complex. either way its historic fragrances exactly like this that i make me enjoy the hobby of collecting but don't just blindly throw money at something. it's honestly nothing more than a collectors piece. if you're into that definitely try it."", ""I have the 1st edition (pre-reformulation) and I'm really liking it. What I like about it is the powdery aspect added to the darkness and opulence. The oud is there, but it's not in your face, to me the oud is more of a background note where as the amber is right at the front. Amber, oud, powdery....my three favourites.  This is a stunning masculine fragrance. Perfect for evening wear and late luncheon."", 'With 45 years of experience, this is hands down the best fragrance I have in my heavy and eclectic collection.

The depth, complexity and uniqueness of this fragrance surpassed niche worthy then, and is well beyond niche worthy now. Yes, It commands a heafty price tag, but it\'s always been woth it. The rich cherry opening, the stately and manly woody vanilla, and initial burst citrus and spice mingle to create an unparalleled and robust experience only a young Tom Ford, Alberto, and Jacques could create. Even the best clone houses can\'t come remotly close as I\'ve tried them all the reason I have 15 bottles and hold them dear.

I actually own both - the original and the latest release and both are getting me more complements than any perfumes I ever used. I‚Äôve had a woman chasing me outside of a supermarket asking about it! It‚Äôs simply different than any fragrances out there. It smells like red wine on skin on a summer evening. I think the closest relative would be SANTAL ROYAL by Guerlain. Rich, warm, luxurious, velvety and spicy with fruity undertones and TONES of charisma. Also, I love the masculine amber simplicity of the original bottle which screams Tom Ford‚Äôs DNA (not to mention the super-controversial marketing!)

Both smell amazing and it appears that the oud is aging and the fragrance is getting riper with time. This is one of those scents that lives up to the hype, while being subject to hype. Allow me to explain. This was the very first oud fragrance marketed to the West, done so perhaps more than a decade before oud became a thing in mainstream perfumery. It is also a Tom Ford YSL fragrance, which is extra legit. It smells like the color of the bottle and has a very medicinal, cherry cough syrup scent to the uninitiated. For my nose, it is an Indonesian oud, which lends to a medicinal, slightly foresty/green feel. However, it is an incredibly wearable cold weather fragrance. The rest of the players (a bit of rosemary, amber, and vetiver) make this a late Fall/Winter gem. How to wear? Less is more. One shot to the chest, under the clothes. Let little wisps come out and tell a mysterious tale.', ""My review is for the new cubic bottle version (La Collection). I cannot find a thing that others mentioning about the og. 5 mins after spraying, it becomes a skin scent. It reminds me a very very very watered-down version of Chopard Oud Malaki or Rasasi Sotoor Waaw. At max, it might last 3 hours. I am very much disappointed at all these new watered-down to the death reformulations. I don't even get the point of its experience anymore. Again this is for the new version. IMHO, don't waste your money on the new version. P.s. I had a chance to try the new YSL Jazz when I was in Paris and it was darn close to my vintage bottle. I am wondering if the M7 is really different from its og or not. Only someone who has experienced both can tell. P.s.s. don't get me wrong! This smells good but the fact it's sooopo weak is the part I don't get. I am not looking for a loud oud. Just something that would have had some silage and wouldn't be gone in 2-3 hours."", 'The best designer oud fragrance. I use it at maximum once a year just to take a sniff.', ""It seems like most of the notes are in this fragrance to subdue the musky amber. This is a very calming fragrance for me.

Back then, I didn't know much about fragrance at all. I also never gravitated to strong male only fragrances either, because they were always so sharp and or cloying to my nose. I thought I was doing it big, because I knew about Jean Paul Gaultier's Le Male when not many did lol. I picked this M7 up somewhere, not knowing about oud and it's rarity, or about notes and blending, or anything at all about parfumery. If I smelled it and liked it, I bought it. When I smelled this though, I knew it was special and naturally I only wore it once in a blue moon. I had the body wash and everything. Over time I realized I put it toward the back of my shelf and hadn't thought about it for years. Years later, I still own almost a full bottle of this original beauty and since its definitely discontinued, I never touch it. Maybe I'll use it again, maybe I won't use it much at all, except on really rare occasions.

As a kid, I found my bottle with a man who was cleaning the shelves at his father's place, I don't know if I paid him $20, maybe less. I use this perfume for special occasions. It smells like cough syrup. Sticky Sweetness, and yet some bitterness in the background. Masculinity and tenderness in one, like a wolf in lamb's clothing. Sweet masculinity, but not too sweet. Wood, amber, animal moments ... trampled chitrus in the background. My mother's love, care and tenderness appeared in my head, when I was sick and when she took care of me.

No because my bottle should last a lifetime since I wear sparingly. And this is a 2 spray kind of beast. But what if I didn't have a bottle? Well, put it this way.

I‚Äôve been using this since 2003, and paying crazy money to keep it in my small collection. Always get asked about this scent and don‚Äôt mind telling, since this is almost extinct. This will always be my favorite.', ""To be clear I am reviewing the more recent version of M7- Square bottle/ 'M7 Yves Saint Laurent' printed on the front/ 'ACCORDS- MANDARINE, BOIS DE OUD, PATCHOULI, CISTE, MYRRHE, 2002' printed on the side. I bought it online and don't know much else. But it is not the original, or the M7 Absolu. To start I pick up very little mandarin orange in the opening. But the Ciste, or Labdanum which I know so well from Mancera's Hindu Kush is prominent and carries throughout the dry down. The Oud is there, but blended in a way that is better suited for the Western nose. In fact, the Oud, patchouli and Myrrh are so well blended that its hard to define them as separate entities. I've only every tried Dua fragrance's copy of the original M7 named D7. That is a dirtier, less complex fragrance than mine. There is no barnyard like funkiness from the oud in my M7. But it is a very labdanum centric fragrance to my nose. So if you do not like labdanum this is probably not for you. It is not a beast, but it does linger. I do enjoy it now in the cooler weather. But the labdanum combined with the oud can be a bit cloying if applied to close to your nose. Back of the head, down the shirt and the extremities work well for me. 3-4 sprays is enough. Not a signature scent for me, but a wonderful addition to my collection. Will wear it 1-2 times a week from now till Spring for sure.

My bottle is flipping old‚Ä¶.I mean, probably one of the first off of the line!! This garnered so much attention through the years and rightfully so. The oud was always prominent but is more on sweet side backed by amber. Mystery is a bottle! It never failed to impress!! I decided to take it for a ride again after vaulting it for quite a few years. The top notes are completely gone‚Ä¶probably because it‚Äôs an EDT. It‚Äôs pretty soft in the opening‚Ä¶a very light cedar with a faint cola vibe. As it dries down the DNA starts to shine‚Ä¶but not as pungent and in your face like it used to be. It‚Äôs like a more tame Nasomatto Pardon!  I wish I would have worn this more through the years because I feel like it‚Äôs a shell of its former self. Longevity is cut in half but when it‚Äôs on my skin, it‚Äôs 100% bliss!  Cheers! EDIT: Since my review, I've given it a few full wearing's and the top notes have decided to resurface!

But I own Dior Homme Parfum and I think it was inspired by this. Now I understand that one more than I did before. Wow. Such a shame this is discontinued.

From an age when phones, tv, cars and pizza were not yet smarter than the people using them.  When it was first released M7 was an instant love. The scent, the ad, the bottle. I busted M7‚Äôs ass on a daily basis. And why would not I. Underneath all the cherry woody ambery goodness there is this sneaky little dirty oud waving cheekily at me. Needless to add that my 2003 all red M7 still smells better than most of today‚Äôs oud wannabes.  *****', ""This masterpiece is so difficult to review, I always find it difficult to explain that I particularly like them also because it is like dissecting my intimacy, it becomes a very personal thing and honestly I don't know where to start, but let's start with a similarity. Compared to modern perfumery, M7 is an orange spot in a sea of gray. It is certainly one of the most beautiful, original and fascinating perfumes I have ever smelled. I went in search of M7 when the hype wasn't as high as it is now, as soon as I smelled it, I immediately felt that it had something different than all the other perfumes. Today it has become almost impossible to find, and deserves all the hype surrounding it. To understand the essence in all its completeness it seems only right to start from the birth of this perfume. In 2002, Tom Ford, creative director of Yves Santi Laurent deals with the marketing of the seventh fragrance of the group, for this reason it is called M7, and he succeeds very well, the bottle, the mysterious amber parallelepiped is more striking than the nude used as a testimonial, a trusted creation. in Morillas and Cavalier, not two common noses. The thing that makes this perfume special is the introduction of real agarwood, never used before by Western homes. Today there are an infinite number of perfumes containing oud, but with the difference that in M7 the oud is real and not synthetic, and also blends perfectly with the ingredients, it does not want to be a perfume made mainly of oud and more. The opening of M7 is nothing short of overwhelming, aggressive, it is a paw of a tiger, medicinal, pungent spicy, dried herbs, mandarin rosemary and Haitian vetiver which then blend perfectly with amber, the round and woody oud, but not chewy as we are used to in modern perfumes. The perfume with the passage of time becomes sweeter, amber, dark, it lies gently on the skin remaining slightly powdery, deep, soft, modern despite being a 20-year-old perfume, it stimulates the senses, very versatile, and above all, elegant, masculine, oriental, absolutely three-dimensional, dense and damn sexy and long-lasting. And there is another reason why they like M7 so much, by now I was tired of perfumes, I had boxes full of the usual cheap perfumes that now appear like mushrooms on the shelves of perfumeries, M7 was my key to perfumes vintage / discontinued, it made me understand you can find emotions in the bottle even in old perfumes, finding old gems has given me a lot of satisfactions that not even the best niche could give me. I knew this review was going to be long and I'm sorry if I bored you. I close with a banality but it is the harsh truth, they will never make perfumes like this again. Rated 10/10"", 'So by now all of the people experiencing M7 original are having a vintage experience. I searched for decants of this for awhile. The first decant I didn‚Äôt quite appreciate. I figured that m7 had gone bad with age, and I have found some different decants that are a little better, but I was expecting some loud beastly scent... M7 is much more subtle than that. The amber oud musk mixture is beautiful but it does have somewhat of a feminine quality to it in the way you might find Dior homme intense as more metro or unisex. It is unique. I have grown to love and long for this one. It lasts and probably allows for unique wafts off you for hours. I think it is a great gentleman scent. it is a shame this has been discontinued. The new m7 isn‚Äôt the same, but you can get a pretty decent idea of the scent.', 'ÿßÿπÿ™€åÿßÿØ ÿØÿ± ÿπŸÖŸÇ ÿ®ÿ±ŸáŸÜŸá €å ÿπŸàÿØ ----------- Scent & Quality: 10/10 Longevity: 8/10 Sillage: 8/10 Creativity & Uniqueness: 9/10 Affordability: 5/10 ----------- Overall: 8/10', ""An iconic fragrance such as the 2002 M7 deserves to be tried, and I was fortunate to find a bottle of the original juice and gladly added to my collection. Naturally, I have scoured the reviews, all of them, good, bad and neutral, and now would like to add my humble opinion. The bergamot and mandarin opening is like a rush of fruity goodness. Do I get the cherry cough syrup? No, but I can see how some noses might interpret it as such. I get more of an Italian vermouth vibe, specifically, Carpano Antica. The middle notes of Vetiver and Agarwood begin almost immediately to tame the fruit, but not eliminate it. But it's the Musk and Amber that are the stars. Longevity is at least 12 hours, but if you spray it on your clothes, you can expect a much longer duration. There was some discussion of comparing this to a much more inexpensive Avon product, Premiere Luxe Oud. I have both and last evening I sprayed the back of each hand with each. One spray only. The openings of both definitely share a DNA chain, but it's the dry down that catapults the YSL to stardom. The Avon dries down to a pencil shaving scent, while the YSL keeps that Amber and Musk shining, long into the night. In the morning, I still smelled the YSL, while the Avon was just a memory. Now, one could argue that the price difference more than makes up for the lack of longevity and eventual dry down smell, however, one could also make an argument that a VW gets you to your destination as well as a Mercedes. Indeed, that's what we're comparing here, a luxury vehicle vs a Yugo.  I am glad I have both, but I am so very pleased to have the original YSL M7 in my collection. It's a masterpiece of perfumery. Next comparison will be against the M7 Oud Absolu (Black label)."", ""To my nose, M7 is the genesis that brought TF Private Blends to the fragrance world. Equal parts Moss Breches and Oud Wood, it instantly brought a smile to my face today after many years of missing its glorious aroma. The first blast brings an almost cinnamon-like, cozy haze of woody oud-y goodness that is hard to match. It's rich, but it's not heavy. It's edgy, but it's balanced. It's smoky, but it's smooth. For men my ass. Anyone can wear this, and anyone should if they can get their hands on this gem. One of the best ever. Period."", '(Review of original formula bottle from January 2003, batch nr. 3003) In my opinion one of the best designer ouds ever made and one of the first ones too! It starts out with a herbaceous citrus mix that quickly fades away (could be because my bottle is 17 years old though) and gives way to a gorgeous oud, vetiver, amber, and musk mix. And for once, the oud actually (kinda) smells like oud! A classic woody, dark, kind of peppery oud. Even though the oud is great I don\'t think it is the main player here. Instead the amber and musk really shine together in a way that reminds me of Musc Ravageur (2000) but, dare I say, better. ü§≠ To me it smells dark, smooth, and very masculine. You can definitely tell it was an inspiration for Tom Ford\'s later Oud Wood (2007), although this one is a LOT darker and feels more ""full"" where as Oud Wood feels a bit hollow to me. The sweetness of the amber is also better balanced in M7. I haven\'t tried the later releases of M7 so I can\'t compare this to them. Unfortunately the prices for these bottles have skyrocketed, but if you can get your hand on a sample for an ok price then I definitely think you should give it a try.', 'I think the original .04 oz sample vial I got from eBay (in the original M7 plastic wrapper) had lost some of the top notes over time, because it seems pretty weak. Or it could just be that my nose doesn‚Äôt pick up certain notes that strongly. I do like the overall scent though. Kinda smells to me like Duro by Nasomatto. I might have to get a 15 ml bottle or a decant from a full bottle or a less old bottle in order to get a better concentration of the scent.', ""M7 2002 : Oud/Wood/Amber parfum Who owns the original chemical formula could write if in the first M7 there is oud oil or its equivalent of a laboratory, until then, when someone will show the formulation, everyone can imagine what they think is most comfortable to justify the price of a first edition. Objectively, the two perfumes compared the first and the version now on the market, are completely different. The shades are sometimes small sometimes they are very noticeable. The first M7 is an enveloping and complex perfume, I don't like it very much but the second is something terrible for my sense of smell and I think also for those around me, I can't smell it. The perfume M7 first version is instead very warm in the dry down, is a game from Oud-Oud-amber, beautiful Amber-Oud-Musk-Rosemary in the hearth, only warm nice Amber in the end. Sorry but the new M7 is very different not have this games in the skin. I like the original and unique first version M7. And the design of the first version bottle? Simple Californian Modern Art.

This opens like one of those, and I don‚Äôt know if they were only a european thing. The myrrh and basenotes underneath clash with the candy sweetness skankily on my skin, almost evoking barbecue, then high-pitched hairspray, and I will not be able to enjoy this. Oud is only very light, if at all. It smells really grand, though. I don‚Äôt know when or where I would wear it. I don‚Äôt mind coming across both effeminate and super formal, but I don‚Äôt have the clothes nor the occasions for it. It‚Äôs so ‚Äòdandy‚Äô. I would love it on certain people. I also second the ‚Äòsamurai out of the shower‚Äô impression, I can smell a disciplined warrior in there, especially if he uses powder on his hair and body. Sorry to give the opposite story to the majority, but M7 Oud Absolu, which I have known for a while, is much more my thing. The luxurious mandarin-rosemary opening, the deep and austere myrrh, the medicinal oud and the sweet, ambery, woods-infused base work very well for me. Maybe the original just jars with my skin. P.S. I like it a bit better outdoors, floating on a breeze.', 'What a Samurai fresh out of the shower would smell like -if he lived in the 21th century.

Not a clone, as they have distinct differences, but have a similar thin, tinny feel but also very sophisticated with a dark vibe. Like a man in crisp white shirt and well tailored black suit giving off the vibe of walking through a mossy forest. I know that makes no sense, but that's the vibe. I would enjoy this on a crisp fall night or cold winter night at home, listening to jazz or classical, mapping out a plan to take over and dominate a market."", 'Rather spend on By Killian', 'Recently received 30 ml‚Äôs of YSL M7 Absolu Oud.

Uncovered!‚Äù  Now, the Taschen published long ago a book ‚ÄúMale Nude‚Äù. There is a black/white picture of nude Yves Sain Laurent himself when he was young. Oh my heart! - please find it.. one look to see that the Master (Saint Laurent always will remain my favorite figure in fashion, even though I am not crazy about his House after he‚Äôs gone) - the Master is not from this world.. and it‚Äôs not about plain erotica.. just find and see.  Also hold in mind who was the executive person to create this treasure- Tom Ford (think of all his mind set and further campaigns).  I don‚Äôt know better and more sensual wood in men‚Äôs perfumes.. I do not agree that it‚Äôs powdery as mentioned - ‚Äúpowder‚Äù is olfactory illusion for this one if you overwhelm your nose, if you overspray. Be patient- don‚Äôt shove nose into freshly applied area, let it sink to body hair and skin. Then it will start radiate warmth and depth, all the shades of a tree that absorbed sun and wind, water and minerals - turning them into organic life, starting to glow.  This fragrance lasts eternity. Next day if I get emotional - the invisible sweat breaks up from the skin - and it releases new waves of aroma. If I wouldn‚Äôt have to shower- I would not know if it ever ends.  I know now that M7 cannot be re-launched. You can‚Äôt do anything with cheap synthetics in here. Well, they reused the name for the new line, but they can‚Äôt just put out same bottle cause they can‚Äôt come close to what aroma it was.  I have an original bottle. It will be sad day when it will come to it‚Äôs end. Oh, I will miss it! But for now - I do 1 spray into middle of chest, 1 on a back of my neck and 1 below my waist - and when it reaches senses - I feel beautiful despite mirror (I unfriended mirror long ago, and in peace with that). And I know someone who agrees that I am beautiful ;) in such times LOL.  Very personal and meaningful fragrance IMHO.', 'i had the luck to have the original one, the first one. it was a beast. what a misterious, dark, strong, different, animalic scent. the oud when there was no oud. a perfume not for everybody, a legend. 9,5/10', ""No real oud. Sorry FreedomLover, but I have tested myself, and checked with a friend who is an expert. Yea, I know I took it pretty hard myself... :0 Both of us have oils from all over the Oud regions, esp him, jeebis he has a lot. This guy actually has chunks of oud lying around in his house, and more than one kind. Yea, true story. If it had real oud, it would leave an oily base on your skin that would stay for quite a awhile. I have a nice stash of vintage M7. 2 different batches from 2004. I will part with 100mls, but only in trade for, Chanel Egoiste Cologne Concentrate.  Beyond that all I can say is that everything that has been said in a positive fashion is correct. This is just so perfectly what I ever wanted in a perfume. It's an oud, with amber that does not have any vanilla in it to taint the amber. Damn vanilla!! And ohhhh, what an amber it is! To die for. Not really mentioned by others, but I really pick up the rosemary in this. Makes sense, I guess, I mean I do speak for the trees and all. ;) The rosemary is what really sets this apart from any other Amber you will smell. I can't describe what this note contributes in words, but is just wonderful. Think of a deep dark, but yet not sharp piney smell. Kinda like rosemary, I guess, lol. BTW, don't worry about the Bergamot. It does not stand out in the this. Just accents the amber a little. Very much in the distant background. This is not fruity, nor does it have rose!! :) Obsession For Men, Fahrenheit, Egoiste, and MF'n,Vintage M7. Those are the men's fragrence names that will ring out forever, and are from a time that is no more. DESIGNER BEASTMODE. Thanks, I speak for the trees."", ""@fromthebayaroundtheway. Fantastic review for a legendary masterpiece unique fragrance. A truly addictive fragrance. For me NOTHING compares to this forget Creed forget new Tom Ford, this beauty started the oud craze and I'm convinced it must have contained some pure oud oil in its blending, as it lasts and projects all day easily and as for sprayed on a shirt will last days."", ""M7 by YSL is to me a masterpiece. This fragrance is the quintessential blending of oud into a designer fragrance that doesn't go overboard with sweetness. M7 was one of those game changers not only for perfumery but also for myself and my personal tastes in perfume. This scent represented linking the exotic with the classic and romantic and doing so effortlessly and beautifully. M7 is deserving of its' hype and truly does represent what haute designer perfumery used to be and needs to return to. M7 starts off with a smooth, almost medicinal smelling oud that is accentuated with some amber and a really perfectly rendered vetiver. This trio smolders in the opening, the effect is smoky, sensual and very enticing, M7 then freshens up a bit with some rosemary. This herbal injection prolongs this beautiful amber and oud combo. The mandarin orange and musk then settle in giving this scent a warm masculine touch and an added depth. As M7 evolves the oud is never buried under other notes, it is more or less enhanced by the other notes, allowing the oud to show it's full range (the oud is able to release its' dirty and slightly skanky side in a great way!). The separation of notes in this composition is very clear and attests to the quality of this scent. Overall, M7 finishes off classy, sexy and very sophisticated.  M7 is an exotic wonder, this is a world traveller in a bottle. M7 is that statement fragrance, that announces someones confidence, maturity and sensuality. This fragrance is masculine but can easily be worn by a woman, in fact my wife will wear this from time to time and it smells amazing on her. M7 is great for the late twenties to late thirties crowd. Keep M7 out of the office, it is too good to waste in a work environment. This fragrance is perfect for date nights, and on dressed up or dressed down winter occasions. M7 should be worn across the chest (on bare skin) and around the neck to really use your body temp to warm this scent up in cold winter air. M7 will draw in your better half and will give you a sensual element to your scent repertoire. Give this a few sprays on a cold evening when all you want to do is let out your brazen romantic side with that special someone."", ""This magnificent fragrance is very similar vibe to mancera sand aoud.i was very suprised nobody else has picked up on the similarities.  The vintage M7 is without a doubt smoother and more intense. Prices are crazy now I'm blessed to have a good stash of bottles for future use.  Please try mancera sand aoud you'll be impressed."", 'This was the first perfue in my life, which almost got 10 points for me (it is very rare!) and still one of my favorite.

Its one of those frags that projects masculinity without needing to be forceful, I think its too multidimensional to be a regular daytime scent but its a near perfect evening scent. Its an oriental, a balanced, sophisticated gentleman's oriental.  These days M7 can't be purchased by the average buyer without experiencing substantial buyer's remorse. You could score two solid modern fragrances, two decent classic colognes which are still in production plus an 80ml bottle of M7 Oud Absolu which is quite good in its own right all for the COST of a 100ml bottle of M7 Today.

I have to admit the cherry cough syrup vibe hasn't ever wowed me, but it's not what I only get anymore. After smelling some other Oud's and getting to where I kind of have some more experience with the note, I can begin to understand why something like M7 is blended the way it is. The dark resinous wood smell has to mix with something like that to make it wearable. I have the Oud Wood by Tom Ford, which is one of my most and best complimented frags on my skin, and my favorite Niche Oud by Armaf, but this one really got me into the game on Oud, and I'm really glad to have it in my collection. It still smells a bit dark mysterious, with a bit of that cough syrupy vibe at pretty much the beginning. After about 15 minutes in its dark, resinous wood. That's mostly what I get. Love it for its bringing Oud into the mainstream."", 'Revolutionary, d√©cadent and painfully beautiful. True craft delivered by Cavallier & Morillas.', 'seems tame now compared to what it seems when it came out..similar to Oud by Kurkdjian in my opinion. Very long lasting', 'Dark, resinous, and powerful, in terms of intensity, YSL M7 lives up to the hype that it\'s built as a bygone fragrance from the Tom Ford era of YSL. Seemingly a mix of oud, incense, and resin, but nothing too well-defined, lending credence to its superb blending. I do like how it sweetens and the sharpeness gives way to sweetness in the dry down. It\'s sophisticated, masculine, and strong, while not being overpowering or cloying. This original is definitely superior to the reformulated version, M7 Oud Absolu, that is part of a line, ""La Collection,"" of a handful of reformulations of vaulted classics, like Jazz. Certainly for an EDT, it\'s superlative in terms of power, along the likes of the 1980s powerhouses, or even some of the Mugler A*Men line. I\'m not blown away but I\'d still say it leans more toward a ""love"" than a ""like"" so I\'d be happy to have more than my decant but am also content to test my decant out while I test the market, though the market surely seems high for it. 8 out of 10', ""Bought the 2002 old formulation today from a dumb guy in $65 lol. Trust me this one is a beast... Oud Absolu is just half of it as this one is more deeper more luxurious and more creamier and more subtle.....  Pure ARABIAN PRINCE Perfume. Although it is an Oud fragrance but it is blended very well that it doesn't feel heavy at all neither it will overcome you or gives you a headache even if you over-spray it...  Just perfect amount of everything with powdery yet very masculine Dry down...  I would love to wear it even with my clothes on ;) 8.5 Out of 10 for me... Mature fragrance though not for teenagers."", 'This is an Arabian man in an expensive French suit. M7, Fahrenheit and Kouros are the holy trinity of classic manly fragrances and they perfectly describe the 3 types of men that come as what society defines as masculine. Diametrally opposite would be For Him by NR, Dior Homme and Chanel Bleu. While they are refined and classy, the first three are pure sex in a bottle. Talking about M7 means talking about Tom Ford. A guy I dont like as a designer, director a person, but highly respect as he is a money making machine. From his success at Gucci to YSL to the most genius marketing trick of all time - sponsoring Suits, he knows how to get people to buy his stuff, and his risks pay off. Thats what happened with M7. Introdusing oud to designer scents was a brave move and, even though I am not a fan of Arabian scents, hats down mr. Ford for doing it. I find nearly all oud scents to be similiar, differing only in sweetness. This one I can imagine myself wearing (while Gucci Intense Oud - never), but would never do so. It is sweet, warm and dark, extremely masculine, but bothersome and agressive. People will get offended if you overspray, so apply gently and ONLY in the winter, so you dont suffocate people around you. And put some pants on, dont be like mr. De Cuber', 'best!', '5/10', 'Original vs Reform vs Oud absolu I have always defended Oud absolu and i always will but my preference has shifted by a little, not much, to the original although i preferred Oud absolu for a looong time out of the trio. My preference has shifted a bit because i have discovered that the original is actually the ""most"" wearable out of the three although it is still to much set apart from the maintstream fragrances to be called a ""safe scent"". It certainly also is not that agressive, superbold, uber masculine chessst hair scent that some reviews give the impression to. I think the original and Oud absolu are closer to eachother then the original and the first Reform. Original: The original is the softest of the three. Some people describe this scent as powdery and for that also finding it ""feminin"". I know what they mean with the powderines but it is not really powdery. To me it is something else. I prefer to describe it as ""mellow"". It borders to powdery (the dryness of the amber might create such effect) but it is not and i don,t get that ""to feminin"" impression. I do get the slightly medicinal opening and the cherry/tobacco drydown and also the oud is certainly present but ""mellow"".  Performance: good, not to loud which is good Reform: If you prefer your oud really medicinal/gasoline like with a sweet undertone then this is the one you want. The oud absolu opens like this but it fades away. With this one the medicinal tone keeps going and in a way this one might also be the most ""harsh"" one out of the three. If you want a taste of the reform then you must try the opening of oud absolu. Performance: good, harsh almost loud.  Oud absolu: Maybe some called the original to powdery, to feminin, the oud to mellow, and the reform to harsh and to medicinal so why not mix these two together.. Oud absolu opens pretty medicinal but it softens. Instead it slowly makes room for patchouli,myrrh and mandarine which are pretty dominant in this one. Oud absolu is a nice, sweet, patchouli/mandarin Oud scent with a medicinal undertone. Oud absolu feels the most dense, maybe the boldest of the three but in a way also the most appealing one.  In the base/late drydown, this get\'s the closest to the original. Performance: good longevity, good projection, dense and sweet Personally i like them all three but it\'s not a love. Hope i added tiny value with my brief review.', 'Great fragrance. Its similar to M7 Oud absolu, but much fuller and deeper.', ""nothing special- fogy ...but with vintage- hypster-barbershop-cult-status. OK, I found it , i purchased it and... after so many aggrandized noise here. Who will wear it on a daily base because the Christmas is just one time in the year?!

The fragrance from the past century- bitter, foggy(hide something?), dirty, masculine, woody...salty (why?), almost rotten tangerine / clementine, aham, also, with some unclean make up powder from the female-products assembly line.

I discovered it only last year after reading reviews at my leisure. Having been lucky on ebay I now own 2 full bottles of this. The all brown one (2002) and the reformulated version (2008). I actually bought the second one by mistake cause I didn\'t know then, how to distinguish between the 2 versions. Anyway, here they are now ! Having read about the ""groundbreaking usage of oud"" in this scent and having already owned and enjoyed scents ranging from Montale\'s Dark Aoud to Ajmal\'s Al Shams Special Edition, I was puzzled if not disappointed at first sniff. I couldn\'t detect any trace of oud in M7. Just a mellow, cherry cola, spicy, soft and warm sensation turning more insency and dark at drydown. I soon realized that I was judging this from the wrong perspective. M7 was not meant to be an Oud bomb back in 2002. M7 perfumers used Oud as an integral part of the whole formulation. More like a key cog-wheel but as part of a highly complicated mechanism. To cut a long story short, it took me several wearings to fully appreciate this scent. It is masterfully blended. It offers a short but fantastic opening to quickly turn ambery, woody, spicy, peppery, warm, not so sweet anymore with a delicate medicinal vibe. Fantastic and long lasting classy and dark drydown with woods and light smoke to my nose. M7 quickly turns to a rich skin scent but it possesses the magic power to reappear at random instances and drive my senses wild ! A fantastic addition to my collection. Now, as far as the reformulated (2008) version is concerned, well, in my opinion it is not bad at all. It is slightly harsher at the opening and it does dry down to a less mellow-thick scent. My guess is that the more striking differences between the 2 versions (should they exist) are for the expert noses - which is not the case with me ! The older version offers better longevity & sillage on my skin. Mesmerizing.  2002 : 9/10 2008 : 7.5/10', ""Without a doubt one of the most unique and truly addictive fragrances ever made. If the bottle has been stored properly it's fully powerhouse monster longevity and silage. I admittedly bought testers from the bay and they were nothing special. However when i got sealed bottle.

My roommate in college had Kouros, and I would steal a shot every now and then. That woke me up to the impact a fragrance can make. Then 20 years later not wearing fragrances much, I walked into a frag shop and picked up a YSL M-7 Fresh; enticing to say the least. Now 3 years later I have a great colection of 40 best possible bottles for me, and I just caped it off with the two vintage formulations of M-7. I will update my review when they come in comparing the 2002 and 2008 versions. I have the vintage aftershave so I know I\'m going to love them. Aside from the modern day classic that they are, I love Amber, Vetiver, Oud, and in general woody, green, earthy frags. So this would be a winner for me if they just came out, without all the hype. The sweetness just balances the Oud. As in "" Amber Sultan"", the sweetness balances the Amber. Resins can be a potent note, when blended in a masterfull way, just makes a fragrance great, like with M-7. Just got my 2002 vintage tester. This could be right at home with Tom Ford\'s Private Blend collection. It is rich and luxurious as Amber Absolute or Tuscan Leather. Yes it\'s similar to M-7 Oud Absolu, but the Amber and Oud are richer and penetrate more with the vintage. It has a smooth vanelic sweetness, that takes the sharp edge off the Oud. It is intoxicating, beutifull, woody, like congac, or cream brulee, delicious woody scent. The performance is 70% that of those private blend frags I mentioned, so the high eBay prices are still a good value if compared to "" Private Blend"" colection. OK, my 2008, 2nd formulation came in. M-7 Oud Absolu should also be mentioned.  I\'m disappointed in the 2008 version of M-7 as it\'s very close, 90% to that of the current M-7 Oud Absolu.  So the 2008 has the Oud and darkness dialed down, but is a nice woody spicey scent with some of the smoothness of the original. I\'m thankful that we still have the current M-7 Oud Absolu. Sometimes a great fragrance is discontinued, never to be seen again. Now we have at least a quality reformulation that is reasonably close to the vintage. M-7 Oud Absolu is not inferior to the 2 nd, 2008 formulation, they are slightly different, and I think it\'s just a matter of preference which you may prefer. Oud Absolu has a great mid- drydown. Note: I found an inexpensive fragrance that is close to the original M-7, it\'s "" Bentley for Men Intense"". A current fragrance that is expensive, and is very similar to M-7, but better in performance, and has an added zesty quality, is Amouage "" Interlude Man"".

Maybe he should be banned from this section for a while...', ""Lucky enough to be one of the rare few to acquire the vintag M7 two weeks back. I had only smelt M7 Oud Absolu previously but held off buying in the hopes I'd come across a vintage bottle. Spent the last two years specifically asking for this bottle when entering small and independent perfumeries. Never having any luck. Thanks to a user on here I got a full bottle. So I think it's time to share my initial thoughts. This fragrance, due to the insane hype had resulted in me dreaming about it. The magical red bottle, mysterious and retro. I imagined it would smell like Oud and Cherry. Mainly due to Oud Absolu. Firstly, I think this is similar to Oud Absolu. But on to the fragrance. I get a powdery Oud/makeup bag vibe. But sort of your grandmothers make up. The Oud on the opening is strong and pungent but quickly settles down to a semi sweet, fragrance. The opening is my favourite part at the moment. It also gives off this waxy vibe. I'm finding it to be quite feminine thus far. However I do enjoy it. I rocked it out on new year for the first time. Found projection to be quite weak as it died off within about an hour and became a skin scent. I sprayed heavily as it was very cold as I knew I'd be out for about 8 hours on the night.  The dry down is very reminiscent of Tom Ford Noir EDP which i already own. Think i prefer that to this. I can see why this got discontinued. Certainly not a people pleaser as such and most men would not appreciate this unless you're specifically into fragrances. It reminded my family of a certain 5p sweet I had when I was a kid called 'fruit salad' which i do pick up on.  I actually think Oud Absolu is much better than this. They definitely improved on the original idea. Oud Absolu is much darker and sweeter due to that cherry vibe. It's probably said a lot but it has that niche vibe, reminds me of Dior Leather Oud a bit. If they didn't discontinue this, would it sell? I doubt it. It was right to make it more wearable in the form of Oud Absolu.  I tested Oud Absolu again two days ago to compare having now smelt the original and as i said, i preferred that. Which i didn't expect at all. It's nice and very unique. Not all that long lasting, doesn't project like people say and the as far as I can tell not great sillage. The scent mutes to a soft sweet waxy/powdery makeupy smell. It portrays quite a unisex vibe. I feel Tom Ford wanted to portray some form of homoeroticism in this fragrance. Which i think it pulls off. I don't know why but i find it pretty cool and challenging because of that. But yeah, I haven't had any good or bad feedback on it yet. First night when i sprayed it on for New Year's Eve before heading out, I felt sexy as hell knowing i was going to challenge people's nostrils. Not one for the shy and better suits a dark almost gothic imsge. Scent - 8/10 Longevity - 7/10 Sillage - 6/10 Projection 6/10"", 'M7 by Yves Saint Laurent. M7 draws its intensity and sensuality in a unique olfactory approach, the alliance of noble and refined components and raw vegetable matter. Warm, the heart of M7 comes from a wood so precious, that in its purest form, it is said to be more precious than gold. It is the wood of Oud. Used in exceptionally high concentration in M7 perfume, oud wood merges with vetiver from Haiti to create the warm and intense wake characteristic of the fragrance. Seventh fragrance for men from the legendary French house, M7 is the expression of a new vision of masculine sensuality. This fresh, woody and sensual scent is the first masculine created by Tom Ford for Yves Saint-Laurent. Immediately recognizable. Intensely masculine, all in elegance, it is the most emblematic perfume of the man YSL. Intense and fascinating, the M7 man has a raw manhood and sensuality that make him as desirable as dangerous. A masterpiece by Tom Ford.', ""I have tried both M7 Absolu and the original which i own (Amber bottle). Yes, they are very much alike, but I find the longevity is lacking on absolu even though the smell is just about there. I found that some people deem the new absolu more wearable and not so potent. The new is straight to the drydown, the old takes a little longer to settle. Now let's talk about why the prices for the original seem insane. I like them both, but there is something about owning a piece of fragrance history, especially considering this is Tom Ford's first modern oud based fragrance and the introduction of oud to American masses. So the price of the old will automatically trump the new absolu being that Tom Ford's name is attached to the original which leads into the quality. The quality of the original is complete overkill, in fact, its the strongest EDT concentration i have ever owned. The original is said to have real oud oil as well while I'm not so sure if the absolu does. This kind of quality shows why a fragrance from the year 2002 is still purchased for more than retail; its not stale after all these years and is even comparable to one that was made just recently. In my opinion, 10 years from now the 23 year old original formula will still smell the same while the new absolu will likely go stale. Appreciate the original juice for the history, the artistry and quality made possible through the brilliance of YSL's creative director at that time, Tom Ford. Buy the absolu if you think the price of original is insane, but invest in the original if you must have the best."", 'i ordered a sample to see what the hype was about this... overhyped piece of shit. Is 99% similar to the new oud absolu', 'Does any women got attracted by it ??', ""M7's hypnotic masculine earthy sweet-cherry amber-oud opening is easily in my top 10 favorite openings of all time.

I asked to see it, then angels sang and trumpets blew: a 1.6 oz bottle of the original M7, opened (because was the last of its kind), with a broken corner (ultimately, the owner told me that the person who\'ve acquired it returned because it was ""broken""). In tears I said ""take my money"" and then I also found a bottle of the last batch of Emporio Armani\'s White For Him (which I love) and my happiness was complete!

This smells like real oud because it is real oud, it doesn¬¥t matter whatsoever what this girl said at YSL.', 'Original vs Reform vs Oud absolu I have always defended Oud absolu and i always will but my preference has shifted by a little, not much, to the original although i preferred Oud absolu for a looong time out of the trio. My preference has shifted a bit because i have discovered that the original is actually the ""most"" wearable out of the three although it is still to much set apart from the maintstream fragrances to be called a ""safe scent"". It certainly also is not that agressive, superbold, uber masculine chessst hair scent that some reviews give the impression to. I think the original and Oud absolu are closer to eachother then the original and the first Reform. Original: The original is the softest of the three. Some people describe this scent as powdery and for that also finding it ""feminin"". I know what they mean with the powderines but it is not really powdery. To me it is something else. I prefer to describe it as ""mellow"". It borders to powdery (the dryness of the amber might create such effect) but it is not and i don,t get that ""to feminin"" impression. I do get the slightly medicinal opening and the cherry/tobacco drydown and also the oud is certainly present but ""mellow"".  Performance: good, not to loud which is good Reform: If you prefer your oud really medicinal/gasoline like with a sweet undertone then this is the one you want. The oud absolu opens like this but it fades away. With this one the medicinal tone keeps going and in a way this one might also be the most ""harsh"" one out of the three. If you want a taste of the reform then you must try the opening of oud absolu. Performance: good, harsh almost loud.  Oud absolu: Maybe some called the original to powdery, to feminin, the oud to mellow, and the reform to harsh and to medicinal so why not mix these two together.. Oud absolu opens pretty medicinal but it softens. Instead it slowly makes room for patchouli,myrrh and mandarine which are pretty dominant in this one. Oud absolu is a nice, sweet, patchouli/mandarin Oud scent with a medicinal undertone. Oud absolu feels the most dense, maybe the boldest of the three but in a way also the most appealing one.  In the base/late drydown, this get\'s the closest to the original. Performance: good longevity, good projection, dense and sweet Personally i like them all three but it\'s not a love. Hope i added tiny value with my brief review.', ""Tom Ford and I have the same taste in men, lol. We both like them hairy... Sorry guys, but M7 is unisex for me. It does not smell classic man, that's why I think a women can easily pull that off. Oud is such a strange smell, I never associate it with either sex; just Oud. The dry down is bold, but still unisex.  M7 is my cashmere sweater fume. There is a lot of fuss about cashmere sweater here, cashmere sweater there and we all don't want to hear it anymore, I know, but this one simply is: It smells warm, cosy, tender, stylish, unique.  Short great prolific time that was, when Jaques Cavallier and Tom Ford did perfumes together for YSL. Now those masterpieces are being one after the other discontinued. M7 will be next, I am quite sure.  I can live with the modern times, where 1000 new fumes are thrown on the market every year, most weak bad stuff, but I cannot live with great pieces of work are pulled from the market after short existence. That never happenend in the 20s-80s. Class withstood the test of time then."", ""This masterpiece is so difficult to review, I always find it difficult to explain that I particularly like them also because it is like dissecting my intimacy, it becomes a very personal thing and honestly I don't know where to start, but let's start with a similarity. Compared to modern perfumery, M7 is an orange spot in a sea of gray. It is certainly one of the most beautiful, original and fascinating perfumes I have ever smelled. I went in search of M7 when the hype wasn't as high as it is now, as soon as I smelled it, I immediately felt that it had something different than all the other perfumes. Today it has become almost impossible to find, and deserves all the hype surrounding it. To understand the essence in all its completeness it seems only right to start from the birth of this perfume. In 2002, Tom Ford, creative director of Yves Santi Laurent deals with the marketing of the seventh fragrance of the group, for this reason it is called M7, and he succeeds very well, the bottle, the mysterious amber parallelepiped is more striking than the nude used as a testimonial, a trusted creation. in Morillas and Cavalier, not two common noses. The thing that makes this perfume special is the introduction of real agarwood, never used before by Western homes. Today there are an infinite number of perfumes containing oud, but with the difference that in M7 the oud is real and not synthetic, and also blends perfectly with the ingredients, it does not want to be a perfume made mainly of oud and more. The opening of M7 is nothing short of overwhelming, aggressive, it is a paw of a tiger, medicinal, pungent spicy, dried herbs, mandarin rosemary and Haitian vetiver which then blend perfectly with amber, the round and woody oud, but not chewy as we are used to in modern perfumes. The perfume with the passage of time becomes sweeter, amber, dark, it lies gently on the skin remaining slightly powdery, deep, soft, modern despite being a 20-year-old perfume, it stimulates the senses, very versatile, and above all, elegant, masculine, oriental, absolutely three-dimensional, dense and damn sexy and long-lasting. And there is another reason why they like M7 so much, by now I was tired of perfumes, I had boxes full of the usual cheap perfumes that now appear like mushrooms on the shelves of perfumeries, M7 was my key to perfumes vintage / discontinued, it made me understand you can find emotions in the bottle even in old perfumes, finding old gems has given me a lot of satisfactions that not even the best niche could give me. I knew this review was going to be long and I'm sorry if I bored you. I close with a banality but it is the harsh truth, they will never make perfumes like this again.

I offered my arm hopefully to my wife (without telling her what it is) and she made a stink face: ""Yuck! Grandma\'s house - ashtrays!""  For some reason it appears my wife reads oud scent like ashtrays, which is what happened when I once applied Creed Royal Oud in her presence. A very great pity.

I was hopeful this would be the YSL equivalent of Gucci Pour Homme (2003). And I was disappointed. From my perspective, this really turned out to be a very powdery concoction at its base and not at all what I\'d hoped given the presence of Oud as an ingredient. It now makes more sense that YSL has since taken a much different direction. So while this is likely to be a martyr review of the fragrance, I\'ll breakdown my own experience. It starts as a sharpness from the Orange/Bergamot/Rosemary, and it lacks the depth I would have suspected. The next step should have been Oud and Vetiver, and the Oud -- as compared to other Oud fragrances I currently own or have experienced -- seemed absent. Vetiver was only slightly more noticeable before this dissipated into base notes, which mostly consisted of a very powdery musk. Positively unisex, not a trace of masculinity within the entire composition. Where I\'d expected a fragrance composed off Oud and Amber, I\'d been left with powdery musk and an intro that smelled dead common to any other fragrance from the early 2000\'s.

Vaguely woody citrus. Leaves no impression for me though. Good for if you just want to smell nice but don\'t really care beyond that or if you\'re way more of a perfume guy than me and can actually pick out what\'s good or interesting here. Disappointing because someone recommended this to me when I was asking for a good lavender frag. There\'s some lavender there for sure but it\'s just so boring. Even reviewing this feels a bit silly, like reviewing the scent of a store brand shampoo or something.', 'When fragrances for men made to be masculine and not feminine. I think it start to end somewhere at 2005.', 'I remember when I was in high school, I smelled this fragrance in a theater (I recognized it in the air) and thought it smelled really peppery. My friend commented that it smelled like old person in the air. But, I really liked this fragrance, and I still do. It is spicy and warm and woody and very masculine.', 'It\'s average. A strong woody note softened up a bit by lavender and coriander. The mandarin orange is strong at first but subsides quickly and I\'m left with an understated, traditionally masculine smell that reminds me somewhat of Lalique Pour Homme - except this one doesn\'t perform nearly as well and doesn\'t have as much depth. The scent is just sort of ""there"" without making much of a statement. This fragrance is definitely not for a younger person seeking attention. Wear it and you\'ll catch a few whiffs here and there for a few hours and then it will be gone - I definitely agree with the below user saying it\'s for the wearer, not the people around them. It\'s enjoyable enough but Morillas has done much better, honestly.', 'That\'s one of perfumes you wear not for others but for yourself. I use it daily and i simply adore this scent. It\'s fresh and mildly woody. It\'s not overwhelming and you don\'t get tired of it. discreet but not flashy elegance. For me this perfume is like mild reminder for yourself ""You are really good and there os no need to scream about it"". My bottle is almost over just like Blue label i had before and i definitely would miss both of them', ""I really like it. It's elegant, well blended, mass appealing, and inoffensive. As the comment below me mentions, the notes from the givenchy website differ from those listed here. It might have been reformulated, although it does smell similar to when I smelled it back in the 2000's.  Like most have mentioned here, it isn't the most unique or attention grabbing scent. It's what you would expect from a clean woody freshie. However, there is a note or combination of notes that make this scent distinguishable and give it some character.  Very versitile, although ideal for office/university and casual use in spring during the day (also works in other seasons). Ideal age group is >25, althought that shouldn't deter you from using it if you like it.  Atomizer isn't that good and so is performance. Longevity isn't that bad, maybe 4 - 6 hours. However, projection is the real problem. It's ok (arms length) for the first 1 - 2 hrs, but sticks close after that.  It's a good fragrance at discounter prices, but not worth it at retail price. Moreover, I wouldn't say it's a must own. For me, I bought this mostly out of nostalgia for the 2000's, but I do use it sometimes. Scent 8/10 Performance 6.5/10"", 'Description above on the page says: ""Fresh and woody, it contains the refinement of davana and masculinity of cedar and olibanum."" The same note pyramid is listed on all new tester bottles, so I\'m not sure that mandarine, violet or coriander are even contained here. New formulation is very narrow and one-dimensional, it\'s very dry woody scent, quite heavy on cedar note, which makes it almost bitter in the base. Performance is not so horrible as somebody might say, you can detect it easily for 5-6 hours, but projection is on a very low side.', ""Let's address the elephant in the room, longevity and sillage - it sucks. Don't expect it to perform as well as Sauvage, Acqua di Gio, or even Axe deodorant. Trust me, I've worn Givenchy Pour Homme for roughly 2 years deliberately trying to prove my nose wrong and that this frag does have longevity and performance. Unfortunately, it does not and I don't want you to expect it to. I've maxed out at 20 sprays and it aired out in an hour or so from being sprayed on skin and clothes.  The good is that it is a refreshing, elegant fragrance for a man. It does not yell, it speaks with candor. Pleasant for indoor environment such as an office, a court room, or bank. It opens up in fresh citrus and radiates with a little lavender and woody notes as described in the frag notes section. Great gift. But again, once you spray it you only got one hour before it airs out."", ""Smells like something between Versace man eau fraiche and Terre d'Hermes but bland cheap and boring."", 'I wore this for a couple months and really enjoyed it. Went back to it after taking a break from it and felt like it no longer had a potent smell.', ""Fresh, Woody, Manly and I would say versatile. I used to use it for the office because its lack of sillage (at least the batch I had) made it easy to wear and didn't get clogged in everyone else's nose. Also is not so common to smell nowadays so I think it's worth a shot wearing it."", 'I remember trying this many times way back when it was released in the early 2000‚Äôs and absolutely loving it but not being able to afford it, fast forward to 2023 and I discovered it‚Äôs still available and got a bottle. It‚Äôs as awesome and addictive as I remember, that violet note is amazing. Silage isn‚Äôt epic but it hangs in there and likewise longevity while not amazing is still decent and I can‚Äôt remember it ever being a beast fragrance as some have commented. If you like Dior Fahrenheit especially the vintage version you will probably like this as well, I‚Äôm a big fan of both. I also have the Homme Blue and while they share some similar notes they are quite different, I don‚Äôt mind having both.', 'Good, sexy, long lasting.', 'I almost forgot that I have this in my closet. Today I was bored with my usual go-to fragrances and wanted to give my nose a break. So I picked this up and sprayed a few times on my neck and my jacket. Then something weird happened. A group of ladies in the elevator were talking about how good I smelled.  This has never happened to me. Then I went to the supermarket and a young lady approached me and asked about my fragrance. she said it smelt so good and I told her the name and she recognized the bottle which is definitely memorable. I didn\'t expect this kind of reaction from this old friend. I must say that my bottle is from 2011 so I don\'t know anything about new formulations. I\'ve spent tens or even hundreds of dollars on so-called ""Compliment Puller"" expensive perfumes, I have them All, BDC, Sauvage, Layton, Aventus, and so on but I\'ve never got compliments from total strangers until today.', ""It's fresh, manly and I really love the smell, but it's extremely weak.

Beautiful 25 minutes dough', ""The swiss knife among men's fragrances."", ""Givenchy Pour Homme hit the market in 2002, starting a new pillar within the brand's masculine fragrance division. Its fragrance was created by Ilias Ermenidis and Alberto Morillas and is classified as woody-fresh, while its beautiful bottle was designed by Pablo Reinoso. The creative concept tried to re-establish the more traditional codes of the brand, since the advertising campaign carried the slogan ‚ÄúThe gentleman is back‚Äù, in a double meaning game between the word and the iconic Gentleman perfume, from 1974. Until then, no one imagined that the company would invest in a new pillar, called Gentlemen Only, let alone the revival of the Gentleman pillar, in 2017. Givenchy Pour Homme's fragrance has top notes of cool grapefruit, mandarin, coriander, and violets, which make room for a body of lavender, davana, and vetiver, on a base of cedar and oliban wood, from which its fragrant gum is extracted. I don't know about you, but I find this fragrance incredibly sophisticated and timeless. I think the tagline was very well thought out as it brought back the gentleman from before (who bathed in mossy green foug√®res) and managed to stay modern for many years after its release. When touches the skin, Givenchy Pour Homme is slightly floral, citrusy, and very spicy. The coriander note tends to polarize opinions and because it is located at the top of the olfactory pyramid, something that was little discussed at the time, many men ended up not buying the product based on a blotter. But it doesn't take long, and that blazing aspect gives way to soft powdery violets and a beautiful lavender extract, which just doesn't go in a more feminine direction, thanks to the bitter scent of the davana. The evolution is subtle, the fragrance does not project too much, but the transmitted elegance lasts, and after a certain time, the woods begin to reveal themselves. The cedar is quite noticeable, the vetiver lends a little of that drier facet and the olibanum is slightly smoked, although a soft creaminess insists on exuding. The durability is good, but it hardly exceeds seven hours on my skin. Givenchy Pour Homme is undoubtedly a perfumery landmark in the early 2000s and a great example of an exquisite fragrance, which seems to have been idealized for work environments and formal occasions, even today. After all, not every company can afford to relax on dress code, build a video game space, and have a vast selection of donuts in the cafeteria. I just can't understand why they didn't follow up on this pillar, which has a legion of fans and, even so, took years to release a flanker after the second, in 2009."", 'This perfume is ready and present to accomplish all tasks in the office, parties, shopping, hiking, visits, meetings and work, day and night, in the heat of summer and the cold of winter, with all formal and casual clothes. The fragrance that will never let you down. At first, you will smell a beautiful, refreshing citrus scent with a hint of coriander, then a note of vetiver appears and a touch of lavender, and the finale with a woody aroma gives the masculine character of the fragrance, but nicely with a little sweetness.  The perfume has a charming, comfortable, refreshing, and full of vitality, very elegant scent. It will force you to stick your nose to the perfume or to the place you sprayed it on in order to enjoy its charm and beauty. Because of it, you will get a lot of admiration and positive comments.  The great genius Alberto Morillas succeeded in designing an amazing and attractive perfume with a scent that no one will be upset about, but you will find it multi-use, so much admired by women, that it can even be described as a seductive romantic fragrance. Young people will like it as well as mature men, the performance of the perfume in terms of longevity (4-6) hours on the body, and moderate (sillage and projection), the quality of the essential oil is not high but it is acceptable, and it will not affect the splendor of the perfume. My words and my description of a bottle of perfume made in 2016.', 'Absolutely loved this stuff in the mid-late 2000s. Was super rich & sexy & lasted a 6-8 hour workday no problem. Orange lavender creamy woods. Rich satisfying fresh & just sweet enough. Work with a tie or warm date night. Reformulation time. I will hold off rating until my bottle sits a few months, but this only reminds me of the pour homme that I used to know. Opening is similar & pretty good, Sillage scent is similar & brilliant, smelled up close it‚Äôs pretty synthetic. Not horrible but is that really the standard? Performance is bad. Open projects for 45min, skin scent 1-2 hours then gone. Smell sticks to clothes a little better & I haven‚Äôt tried moisturizing or overspraying in an attempt to boost performance. 4-5 sprays on skin from the crappy sprayer isn‚Äôt enough. Unless the bottle macerates some, I think this gets a meh. Unfortunate, because this was the frag I most wanted from my youth after being a 1 bottle kind of guy for 15 years. This was my one bottle for 2-3 üòú', ""An ok warm and spicy scent, but pretty average in my opinion. The bottle really is bad though - the sprayer got stuck and stopped working very soon after the purchase, and I had to break the plastic outer shell of the top to get it to function again. Shouldn't happen in this price range."", 'Heavier more creamy version of Blue Label. Its less fresh more serious scent in comparing with B.L. This one is spring days scent while blue label is meant to be a summer scent thanks to fresher more citrusy DNA. Pour homme and blue label are around 70% similar. 3.75 / 5 Age;+25 Moderate lasting and projection. Spring days. Casual.', ""I've bought this on and off since 2005. It's safe to say it was and possibly still is my signature scent. There is something almost liquoricey about it that I find addictive. I wear it mostly in the evening but it's very wearable for day too. It isn't overly strong like a lot of mens fragrances are. It's more subtle, classy and unique. That's why I like it and will keep coming back to it."", 'Was my signature scent for more than 7 years bottle after another never change it for any reason now days its a bit weaker but i still have one bottle just for after shower chilling at home situation and i still feel the same pleasure Smelling this unique alberto morillas creation', ""I was gifted this way back when it was a new scent. I seem to really have enjoyed it back in the day. Now it just seems synthetic and boring. I haven't worn this in a while and thought I'd try it out again. Still, not for me anymore. It's funny how time can change your mind, perhaps it will change back one day. It does last a while on my skin and people tend to like it, so there is that."", 'This is a beautiful and elegant fragrance. There is a delicate and delightful cream milk airiness to it even thought no milk or cream notes is listed. Unfortunately, it does not last long on me. My skin eats fragrance and it lasted about 3 hours before it disappeared and I am in a cool working environment.', ""Its an ok scent. I got it mainly because of Morillas. I should state up front that i'm deeply disappointed in the sprayer mechanism of this bottle. The top half of it is not well designed at all, and what comes out is akin to a burst of hand soap. Maybe i'm just not used to an EDT coming out that way. So opening is a nice citrus burst, but frankly just a bit tame. I do very much like the woody aromatic drydown though. Thats a pretty good work scent. Ive only just realised its got violet and lavender. But the lavender is very strong as a note but the violet is thankfully muted. I mean this is obviously about personal preferences here. But look, the scent itself seems to perform very weakly. Low sillage, its really a skin scent in 90 minutes. It does last, but just feels watered down, i had to check i hadn't got a fake. Scent is a manly burst but in a very 80s kind of way. I just think this scent belongs in a different era. What about you? What did you think about the bottle?"", 'Meh. Smells nice, generic, pleasant and safe. Perhaps would make a good affordable gift.  Reminds me heavily of Ferragamo Subtil PH, which to me is much punchier and more dynamic, despite being cheaper.  Plenty of more intriguing options for the price.', 'So this is only vetiver fragrance I like. Good job Givenchy.  P.s.  Vetiver is not the main note at all, but you definitely can smell it. This is an awesome warm weather fragrance with a fresh and pleasing mix of mandarine, vetiver and lavender. Longevity is not so good, but if you want an impressive arrival for a summer dinner, or when meeting with friends, good choice!', ""Can anyone clear me up? why does not this perfume appear but also Blue Label on the manufacturer's website?only the gentleman, gentleman only and Pi series appear listed on their official website.  I'm waiting for an answer if you can!"", 'Review of a 2002 bottle; unsure if this thing has been reformulated but for reference purposes this is an old bottle.  The top is all about sourness of grapefruit, mandarin, and coriander. It\'s an odd, citric, synthetic opening that is spicy/woody underneath. Clean smelling, pleasant enough. not really sweet at all. More of one of those clean, citric precursors to BdC that\'s good for younger guys, the office, etc.  I get average 4-6 hours of longevity with an hour or so of moderate projection. Not bad, at all for this sort of scent. About what I\'d expect.  A 7.25/10 for me. Nothing bad, nothing overly exciting. Compliments have come from folks around me of the ""oh, that smells nice, what is it?"" variety at times. Smells much like my memories of the early 00s.', 'One of my only blind buys and I love it. Got it at SteinMart in ‚Äò06 for super cheap and keep reordering it every year. Fresh, mandarin floral to start. Cedar lavender after dry down. Nice projection leaves a trail with just three pumps but not offensive in the least. Frequent compliments from coworkers and strangers over the years. This fragrance is sophisticated enough for nights out on dates or with friends but doesn‚Äôt smell like a real high end niche. This is an all purpose ‚Äúpeople-pleaser‚Äù. My Mom who hates perfumes and cologne likes this one. Very versatile. I wear it to the gym, work and just for myself around the house or on errands. Some say ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù I say safe. You won‚Äôt turn anyone off with this one. It does have a ‚Äúsex appeal‚Äù but in a gentlemanly way. If you know she‚Äôs looking for an animal maybe don‚Äôt wear this. It is kind of a unisex fragrance I guess. 7/10 longevity. 8.5/10 overall.', ""I remember smelling this fragrance at Bloomingdales in May 2002 because I needed something for a date I was going on that evening. I bought it and rocked that scent all summer creating some of the best times I've ever had. Around fall I ran out of the juice and went back to my Curve/Drakkar/Tuscany rotation. Here I am 17 years later wearing it on my wrist for the first time since I ran out of it and being instantly taken back to 2002 while bringing back memories I completely forgot about! Isn't it funny what memories pop up when you wear certain fragrances? It smells 98% the same....might be a little less potent. I remember going easy on the trigger when I wore this back then but this time around I think I can afford to spray 3-4 more than normal. I've had this on for a little over 2 hours with only one spray and it's still holding up well. I've never had an issue with longevity because of my skin chemistry so I don't think this will be any different. I'm not going to break down the notes in this one because I honestly don't know what it is I'm smelling and I don't really care! I'm just here to share how great this fragrance is and am glad I ran into it again! Edit: I managed to locate a new/never sprayed bottle from 2002. I wasted a few sprays on the back of my hand and it was missing the pungent top notes/opening but the essence was still there. Gave it a full wear and totally over sprayed! Was still lingering on my shirt the next day! Decided to give it another wear yesterday. Holy cow!! I guess it just needed to breathe! Opening was just like I remembered and projected all day!! I‚Äôm a happy guy!!!"", ""If it was masculine as other reviewers have noted then probably when it came out in early 2000's but now the new bottles are easily unisex. My wife likes how it smells on her. It's the most perfumey fragrance in my collection. Performance is average. Lasts as a skin scent for more than 6 hours however it projects only for maximum 2 hours.  I don't have a similar scent in my collection, Ungaro Man has been voted as one of the fragrance that it reminds people off however to me Ungaro smells totally different with a greenish tobacco scent which I adore. So to summarize, my opinion is divided with this one. I like how it smells as a scent but I don't think I like to smell it on me."", 'Mandarin orange, how do I love thee? I love thee with cedar...

It is inoffensive and easy wearable in summer and spring. It opens with a blast of citruses with violet and coriander. After a few minutes you must stick your nose on your skin to feel it. So discreet but nice manly smell. It lacks of projection and the longevity is moderate (4-5 hours), nothing exceptional. I recomend it only for summer and spring for places that the scent must not be so loud.  The most distinguished notes I get are grapefruit, coriander, cedar, labdanum, mandarin-orange and vetiver. The other notes are here but weak. Generally I like it a lot. I wish it had better projection.."", 'scent : 8/10 sillage : 7/10 longevity :7/10 70% day/ 30% night fragrance nice woody and fresh scent', ""It's a very delicate and subtle cologne. I am kind of disappointed since the brand Givenchy is pretty decent in the cologne world and I had high expectations from it. Its mild right from the start. The citrus and woody accords are highly noticeable. On my skin, it becomes a skin scent after 20 mins. But again, I would want to give it a benefit of the doubt by saying that it might react differently for everyone. I am glad that I have it in my collection (I can use it on the days when I dont feel like using other stuff) but I wouldn't recommend a friend to go for it. It's definitely a summer scent."", ""I've long been a fan of Givenchy Pour Homme and I've had it almost since it was first out. I do think it has lost a little power over the years but that's quite a common thing these days. On the immediate plus side, it is very versatile: day or night, winter or summer, work or romance, this one has them all covered (and that's rarer than you might think). I'd say it is moderate in it's strength and duration - usually when a perfume doesn't last long, it means the person is dehydrated or eating poorly or both, rather than the perfume being weak. Givenchy Pour Homme is subtle. It doesn't go around screaming its citrusy top notes or bombing you with woods or spices. It is a quiet pleaser. I like the cedar and the violet mixed in with the orange. There's something else in there that isn't in the fragrance notes, maybe blackberry, which I detect and keeps me intrigued. I like this a lot but I've never fallen in love with it. There's something missing which prevents it from becoming a bona fide masterpiece and I couldn't tell you what that might be. But it is very good. One day it will go the way of most perfumes and end up discontinued or ruined by a reformulation to meet the latest regulations. Buy a bottle now. If, like me, you have quite a number of colognes you wear, this one will last a long time because it's never the first one in your thoughts. I would compare it to the players in football teams on whom others forge a reputation of greatness. It's the quiet midfielder who retains and passes the ball like clockwork for others to launch attacks and score goals. When he's not there, things don't work quite as well. Oh sure, there are the flair players who score spectacular goals and this one will never be the player to make marketing men dream of riches, but, through all the noise and hype, you need a solid, reliable performer to hold everything together. That's Givenchy Pour Homme. Buy it and hold on to it. One day it'll be gone and it won't be quite as easy to replace as you might think. Edit: Alas, another discontinued Givenchy."", ""So, I can say the following about this one: I PERFECTLY understand why they have this particular one to be called (givenchy pour homme). The reason is, this perfume represents the TYPICAL smell of a man, a mature male to be more specific. I am not saying this is how a mature man should smell, am saying that once u smell this perfume,I'll IMMEDIATELY visualise a masculine adult guy. It's not my type, but maybe someday I'll grab this."", ""I threw in a sample of Givenchy PH among some others, just because. Nothing special to be found here, very weak performance.

Among them is the blend of cooly sharp grapefruit, exotic Mandarin Oranges from the Chinese restaurant on the corner laced with other lush fruits and a hint of violets from the flower stalls on the Rue de Rivolli. Givenchy captured those heady Parisian flavors and stirred in exotic spices, warm woods, a few light florals and a dash of Vetiver to come up with this enticingly romantic at times erotic delight.

Just a simple, clean & natural classic. The aromatic greenish-tan scent is pungent and herbal at first, almost leathery -- this soon softens to a sweeter, barely recognizable citrus and vetiver suede. The woodsy spice of the cedar, coriander and vetiver dominate this scent, but the sweet floral and citrus notes round it out nicely.  Ideally suited for office wear and anything from business casual to corduroy.

The idea was to create a ""gentleman\'s"" scent but they were not specific on whether they were regarding a younger or an older gentleman. Either way, it is a mass market appeal fragrance perfect for any teen to a guy in his late 20\'s.  The top notes to this are fantastic and last quite some time. Imagine a fresh citrus floral. YES!!! Even the transition to the heart is great with the fruits, exotic spices, and florals creating something interesting, something with an old world feel blended with a modern take. The base is a big disappointment though. This had so much potential! The top and the heart had a great thing working but this just turns into another ambery, cedar based floral at the base. The funny thing is that amber is not even in the note breakdown but it is defintely there, or at least my nose picks up on it. If you like the amber and cedar in allure homme sport, then I highly recommend this one but if you want this scent with that edge I mentioned, I would recommend trying Hearts & Daggers from Ed Hardy, at least that one stays spicy throughout the scent life and keeps me entertained everytime I wear it. Oh, and True Religion Drifter and Givenchy Pour Homme have the exact same drydown.... the exact same, I thought I would add that.  Overall, this is a perfect, safe scent that is highly inoffensive and will get positive attention. Sillage is good for 1-2 hours then it becomes a skin scent, and the scent life is around 4-6 hours.

If you don't know then you have to try this one.  Being spicy and sweet at the same time can be enjoyable for some but not for me. The note of coriander way too strong.

The coriander is the one which is spicy and the others bring their contribution not like different notes, notes that are supposed to be detectable, but like a mixture, a sweet one. Together this two are like a bomb that waits to be detonated. And when you detonate it (spray it on your skin) a war starts, oh man, and then I hope you have a close source of water near you because this one you'll make you puke.  A big stinker.

Here I am 17 years later wearing it on my wrist for the first time since I ran out of it and being instantly taken back to 2002 while bringing back memories I completely forgot about! Isn't it funny what memories pop up when you wear certain fragrances? It smells 98% the same....might be a little less potent. I remember going easy on the trigger when I wore this back then but this time around I think I can afford to spray 3-4 more than normal. I've had this on for a little over 2 hours with only one spray and it's still holding up well. I've never had an issue with longevity because of my skin chemistry so I don't think this will be any different. I'm not going to break down the notes in this one because I honestly don't know what it is I'm smelling and I don't really care! I'm just here to share how great this fragrance is and am glad I ran into it again! Edit: I managed to locate a new/never sprayed bottle from 2002. I wasted a few sprays on the back of my hand and it was missing the pungent top notes/opening but the essence was still there. Gave it a full wear and totally over sprayed! Was still lingering on my shirt the next day! Decided to give it another wear yesterday. Holy cow!! I guess it just needed to breathe! Opening was just like I remembered and projected all day!! I‚Äôm a happy guy!!!"", 'An early morning walk along the Rue du la Petit Musc in the Marais in Paris is filled with many aromas. Among them is the blend of cooly sharp grapefruit, exotic Mandarin Oranges from the Chinese restaurant on the corner laced with other lush fruits and a hint of violets from the flower stalls on the Rue de Rivolli. Givenchy captured those heady Parisian flavors and stirred in exotic spices, warm woods, a few light florals and a dash of Vetiver to come up with this enticingly romantic at times erotic delight.  Always elegant but never aloof Givenchy Pour Homme has just the right touch of light hearted spring fun that can lead one into an unforgettable summer. Longevity six to eight hours on my skin. Four and a half platinum stars.', ""Givenchy Pour Homme hit the market in 2002, starting a new pillar within the brand's masculine fragrance division. Its fragrance was created by Ilias Ermenidis and Alberto Morillas and is classified as woody-fresh, while its beautiful bottle was designed by Pablo Reinoso. The creative concept tried to re-establish the more traditional codes of the brand, since the advertising campaign carried the slogan ‚ÄúThe gentleman is back‚Äù, in a double meaning game between the word and the iconic Gentleman perfume, from 1974. Until then, no one imagined that the company would invest in a new pillar, called Gentlemen Only, let alone the revival of the Gentleman pillar, in 2017. Givenchy Pour Homme's fragrance has top notes of cool grapefruit, mandarin, coriander, and violets, which make room for a body of lavender, davana, and vetiver, on a base of cedar and oliban wood, from which its fragrant gum is extracted. I don't know about you, but I find this fragrance incredibly sophisticated and timeless. I think the tagline was very well thought out as it brought back the gentleman from before (who bathed in mossy green foug√®res) and managed to stay modern for many years after its release. When touches the skin, Givenchy Pour Homme is slightly floral, citrusy, and very spicy. The coriander note tends to polarize opinions and because it is located at the top of the olfactory pyramid, something that was little discussed at the time, many men ended up not buying the product based on a blotter. But it doesn't take long, and that blazing aspect gives way to soft powdery violets and a beautiful lavender extract, which just doesn't go in a more feminine direction, thanks to the bitter scent of the davana. The evolution is subtle, the fragrance does not project too much, but the transmitted elegance lasts, and after a certain time, the woods begin to reveal themselves. The cedar is quite noticeable, the vetiver lends a little of that drier facet and the olibanum is slightly smoked, although a soft creaminess insists on exuding. The durability is good, but it hardly exceeds seven hours on my skin. Givenchy Pour Homme is undoubtedly a perfumery landmark in the early 2000s and a great example of an exquisite fragrance, which seems to have been idealized for work environments and formal occasions, even today. After all, not every company can afford to relax on dress code, build a video game space, and have a vast selection of donuts in the cafeteria. I just can't understand why they didn't follow up on this pillar, which has a legion of fans and, even so, took years to release a flanker after the second, in 2009."", 'This is an alluring scent. It is fresh, but not acidic, classy, but not dated, subtle, but not forgetable, calm, but not boring...  Oh, my! I could go on and on for hours. Even though it is a warm woody smell, it\'s not as dominat as many other woody fragrences for men. I find it suitable for men and women who desire a perfume that is calm, poised and doesn\'t ""make a fuss"" .  This perfume doesn\'t yell ""Here we go!"", but gently murmurs ""Come closer..."". It\'s lovely!', 'This juice is crazy good, anyone who overlooks it for another generic woody fruity run of the mill is mistaken. I have owned since it was launced in 2002 and it was the best blind buy ever. You get a crisp fresh blast of grapefruit, oilve, vetiver, cedar with a touch of menthol vibe. Its relatively unique if you study it instead of a 2 sec whiff, i personally have never found anything like how it dries down and the next day OMG it if you smell your shirt its the most gorgeous dry, airy, woody smell.  Its a young - mature gentlemans fragrance with a few of the notes missing that make it smell like a nasty old mans smell that so many colognes smell of.  Its a fantastic and i highly recommend it!', 'Masterpiece. I recomend it. Sweet warm and woody. Perfect.', 'Was my signature scent for more than 7 years bottle after another never change it for any reason now days its a bit weaker but i still have one bottle just for after shower chilling at home situation and i still feel the same pleasure Smelling this unique alberto morillas creation', ""WOODY...!!!

I have a fond memory of testing this and the bottle highly advertised from my teen years in 2002 right when it launched- so I went ahead and tracked down a short ingredient list bottle to make sure it was as close to 2002 as possible (bottle is a 2004). Anyways - Just reunited with the scent - interesting. Not quite as orange as I remember yet very citrusy. Almost like a sharp mix of lemon and grapefruit with hints of orange behind it - overall the citrus aroma is rather undistinguishable and rather generic in nature.  Its sweetness is somewhat apparent - lightyears from being anything close to a gourmand. No- no distinguishable cinnamon, nor nutmeg, nor cardamom. Also a generic mingling like the citrus top is done. In 2002 compared to what was out there I could see people intrigued and calling this sweeter than other freshies and seeing it as a trendsetter. This sort of is a hybrid of a spring scent (aromatics) summer (the citrus) and fall (the sweeter spices). Overall though - I remember why I never personally got around to getting a bottle as its an aroma that is an array of notes you cannot pinpoint per say - which is a tactic that is kind of annoying in perfumery. In fact if anything - its sort of a pleasing ambroxan type scent. Very sauvage like without that nasty scratchy fake feeling you get from modern ambroxan. So in comparison - I could be nice and call this the luxury top tier of synthetic ambroxan type freshies. Maybe the wood combo is giving this effect and as to why i'm not having ambroxan chemical symptoms?  Did I mention I absolutely hate spraying this? lol - Possibly the most awkward sprayer ever as your atomizer you press on is literally the bottom of the bottle that you press upward to release the juice from the top - still cool though In modern trends - not much you can do with this - its a casual daytime / sexy sporty scent with some slight playful notes slipped in as a marketing tactic to sell the trendy new ball bottle. It is a very sexy fresh scent though - the more I smell it I just kind of think of jocky sexy guys from early 00s. This is certainly better than the square bottle Hugo Boss orange scent- that one is so nasty- its like apples and vinegar to my nose- least the ball bottle is somewhat orange-y. Its almost sort of feminine the longer it lingers on my skin - again - this is a very strange linear fragrance that sort of leaves you jumbled - even if you have an experienced nose like mine.  Try it! its worth adding to the casual daytime sporty dumb grab shelf. Don't expect too much from this though- It's LITERALLY just a few steps above an edc mall scent and literally is just Generic citrus- sweet violets - pink pepper."", 'Great scent all around. Easy to grab, not offensive to anyone, nothing groundbreaking but does the trick on casual hot days. Just wish it would project a bit more, still fine for the price though.', 'Scent is fine. Bottle is silly. Atomiser is balls.', ""This is a great scent. I first got familiar with it when I went off to college and a friend of mine was on the school's tennis team from France. This was 2003, I have not put my nose on this since then--but as we all know a distinct scent has the power of impression. This one here is a great scent that I might have to search to add it to my collection.  ~ mAKES Too mUch $cents ~"", 'It‚Äôs pretty good actually. I like that it‚Äôs warm, tame & inviting. What ruined it for me is that there is a underlying synthetic ‚Äòperfume-y‚Äô smell undertone.', ""This reminds me of 00s R√∂yksopp. Not a bright shrilling citrus, it's a warm creamy orange, with the slightest of spice sparkle, so if anyone wants a non headache-inducing citrus freshie, this is it. The old bottles are gorgeous."", 'Fun, wearable on any occasion, office friendly. smells like cola and citrus to me. No-one hates it and it sticks around for 6 hours. Also the bottle is unique and kinda fun with its very 2002 design language. I.e. if you ever find it on sale you should get one.', 'My grandpa always wore this one, it was his signature scent. I have such a vivid memory of it: it‚Äôs sharp, clean, manly, and energetic smelling. I remember when I was younger he had it out on the bathroom counter and I didn‚Äôt know what it was, and I ended up spraying it straight into my mouth. I will literally never forget it, and it has a very special place in my heart.', 'I loved this one. I used to keep it in my gym bag because of the metal ball. I didn‚Äôt have to worry about it getting crushed or broken.  Just a really nice warm, active, everyday scent.', ""This is one of those that is timeless in my eyes. I wore this all during the early 2000's and it was before I was nearly as deep into the hobby but I still after all the scents I have smelled I still hold this one close to my heart. Impossible to dislike this. I picked up new bottle after not having it for over 15 years. I even found one in the ball bottle. The orange is very synthetic but in a good way. Like the McDonalds orange drink compared to real orange juice. Its not as real but somehow smells better because of all the added sugar. The dry down blends the creamy orange and cardamom into musky woods so nicely. Longevity is decent. Projection is average. Great for spring and fall daytime casual usage. I'm probably too old to pull this off but its never leaving my collection and makes me happy everytime I smell it. Would be great for college age guys up to 30 or so. 8/10 update : The grown up version of this is Bond No 9 Sutton Place"", ""For the price, this one's a banger. One that has a strong scent memory, from the first time I tried it at the mall, to years later getting a bottle of it, was just a joy smelling it after long.

It does come in a square bottle now but you can still get the ball one aswell, so you\'re both right. Boss Orange, or whatever its called now, is a separate fragrance but he wasn\'t referring to that one. The bottle I\'ve got here is in a grey box with orange trim and just says Boss In Motion, the bottle isn\'t chequered, it\'s a plain glass bottle with orange liquid inside. It\'s the 2022 version of this fragrance. That\'s what people are on about, even though it has it\'s own separate page, but it\'s pretty much the same thing.

I enjoyed its refreshing complexity with a hint of orange and masculine, clean, sporty edge.  The brand was the favourite of the male I spend time with and this was my pick based on the tester of the eau de toilette or eau de parfum concentration.  With this scent gone from the shops in its deodorant form, the male switched to different scents, mainly because I was unimpressed with impact and longevity of the classic Hugo - his then favourite and had better ideas to scent him :)"", ""@dragos_t9x The square bottle titled 'Hugo orange' is a completely different fragrance- this is an apple based scent with a mix of sour and spice. Hugo boss in motion in the orange ball was never titled 'Orange' it was simply titled 'boss in motion' since 2002 release. Hugo boss caught on to the complete marketing mess and removed the 'orange' title from the square bottle- esp since it smells NOTHING like oranges! Surprised everyone in the comments is still confused by this. Its a little confusing but easily cleared up with some light research since the two different scents were technically never named the same thing nor was either scent placed into a completely different bottle design. 2002 Boss in motion is a huge nostalgia smell I remember this on counters when I was 18- creamy cinnamony aromatic orange & vetiver.

Regarding the latter, you get the scent of orange peel upfront. It's very balanced: intense but not cloying, fresh but not acidic. Then a few minutes later cinnamon and nutmeg make their appearance in an exquisite way. Finally, the lotion settles down eventually with a creamy aroma that is soothing, upscale and gourmand (a delicious and rightfully spiced pumpkin pie comes to mind, or a milk-based sweet orange-cardamom popsicle made with premium ingredients). Somewhat long lasting because I spray four times early in the morning at 8am, and by 2pm it still lingers in my skin and clothes. Do not expect a bomb or an attention-grabbing eau de toilette; In Motion is subdued and elegant. Decent projection. Remarkably versatile for any time of year (Spring and Autumn being the best). Suitable for day or night, formal or casual situations. Any age group really although better marketed for the 30-50 year-old crowds. And finally, it can be had for a great price.

Hugo made such a stupid mistake on this that they actually REMOVED the orange name from its title and call it now 'Hugo Boss Man'. I saw their new packaging at TJ Maxx- in fact I bought it at the maxx and then returned it- its so bad lol.  Hugo Boss boss in motion (Which SHOULD have orange in the title) is gorgeous.

Boss in Motion meant a lot to the brand as it had a significant sales success, even higher than the last men's fragrance launched at the time, which was Hugo Dark Blue, in 1999. Its oriental fragrance was perfect for the style of the time and its jovial appeal conquered countless fans, besides bringing a new approach to the masculine perfumery of Hugo Boss, stagnate since Boss Bottled (1998). The fragrance features notes of sweet orange, basil flower, bergamot and violet leaves, in the output. Then, the body brings warmer notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, and pink pepper. And to finish, the base has notes of sandalwood, vetiver, woody accord and musk. The perfumer was Domitille Michalon, who is not a very well known name in the field, but has already been involved in creations for Lacoste, Gr√®s and even Dior. It is classified as oriental-foug√®re, but in my opinion, it behaves, indeed, as an oriental-fruity scent. It is juicy, invigorating and at the same time, it is hot, as the Orientals of that time managed to be. On my skin, the fragrance does not evolve much, remaining with a pleasant smell of orange, which is not citric - contrary to what many think - because it is balanced by the sensuality of spices. It reminds me of the smell of orange cake baking in the oven. Boss in Motion does not project much, but it has a good duration, remaining between six and eight hours in a consistent but intimate way. It combines with professional environments, does not target a specific age group, but conveys joviality. It is good for romantic encounters or occasions where it is not seen with good eyes to wear very impacting perfumes. Its bottle is praised to this day, but was not completely innovative at the time, as Paco Rabanne had done something similar in 1999 when launched Ultraviolet Eau de Parfum. In any case, Boss in Motion is undoubtedly a watershed in the masculine perfumery of the brand and represented a sure kick-off at the beginning of the millennium."", 'I had this but had to give it up on account of it just smelling too much like orange creamsicle that doesn‚Äôt really go anywhere, complexity-wise. I prefer vetiver, woody, scents so maybe I don‚Äôt vibe with InMotion for that reason. I‚Äôm 41 and found that this wasn‚Äôt suitable for any occasion, unfortunately.', 'A very nice scent with a touch of orange , very pleasant . Perfect for summer days .  Average silage and projection .', 'Received more compliments from this scent than any other in my collection. I do go heavy on the sprays ... Sometimes I layer it with Clinique Happy', ""I absolutely love this scent, its becoming harder to find these days. and its either been watered down or i'm nose blind on this now. It has been my signature for years, My girlfriends have loved it. Cool refreshing Bergamot/citrus peels open to reveal a warm smooth creamy wood. so sexy. cool, fresh and warm at the same time. it makes me feel very comfortable, content and confident.  This takes me to when i was exploring the city at night. enjoying the different atmosphere's in different corners of the city.  The latin district with salsa and spicy food.  the club district with that beat pulsing from behind closed doors.  Then the cool spacious city park. The high end district with fine restaurants and designer shop fronts. even though this is a summer scent. in winter i would put it on a under thick soft jacket. the warmth from under that jacket would bring this alive. i would unzip the front and wrap it around my girl, with her arms wrapped around me inside the jacket. we both loved the warm creamy fresh scent."", 'A really nice scent scent from Hugo Boss that was a nice surprise but at the same time there things that were slightly off putting causing this not to be a staple in my collection. This was a nice surprise as this had a very zesty,but also sparkling,fizzy orange note that also had some sweetness from the cinnamon and slight spiciness from the pink pepper. Once this dries down it gets slightly more sweet,smooth and pleasant ! Only thing that holds this back is that once it dries down it does get slightly more feminine so even though this is marketed towards men I can see this being perfectly unisex. Nothing too bad but i do prefer scents that people don‚Äôt have to second guess it being a cologne. Performance is actually good for a freshie as this lasts 6-10 hours but with only average projection. Overall rating‚Äî 6.5 out of 10 ! Decent fragrance for a good price but it will only be something I reach for when I‚Äôm bored of my go-tos and want something different.', 'I am writing this review to share my memories this lovely metallic ball design bottle gave me.  This was the first designer fragrance i used, This perfume brought me to this website and also made be venture into the designer world of fragrance. I will always remember this awesome fragrance, in fact this was my signature fragrance for 3 years. I wore it to work, got plenty of compliments , wore it for casual meets, evening parties ,wherever I could as it is so pleasing. It lasts long and projects a bit. An elegant and all season fragrance for men.', 'Even if is the middle of October, outside are 28 C ( in Romania, Europe), because sunhine has power enough during the day, so I took this good perfume for a spin. I almost emptied my bottle during the summer. This one has nothing to do with Y.S.L. Opium, which I had it yesterday on me. Oh, I see, both have the ingredients pepper and cinnamon, but this is not enough. In this Boss the orange is the leader. Will I buy it again? I guess I will go with BVLGARI Aqva Amara the next summer, as they both have a lot of oranges. Even the bottles look pretty alike ;-) .', ""I've seen so many good reviews about this and i decide to buy it(42$). Well i knew this fragrance for a long time but i never smell it because my favorite frag from Hugo was and still Bottled edt, and try to stay devoted to it.  It' s sunmer, it, s verry hot and i spray this some couple of time. The conclusion ? It's a verry sexy fresh frag with orange juice, a littl vanilla and cinnamamon,and a litl bit spicy. Also you can wear it with sport clothes, on dates,etc. I found this verry versatile ! But i have some negative opinions about: first: i think doesnt have a good sillage, i'm not that person who like to smell from 25 meters away, but this i don t think it s smeel even from 1,5 meters :( , but the longevity it's kind' 6h+ after 4 h became close to the skin.  Per total: Scent: 8,5 Longevity: 6,5maybe 7 if u ober spray. Sillage: for the moment 4,5, but i will make an re edit if i m wrong right now Versatility: 9 ! To buy it or not ? I think you should buy it if you re a man with fine tastes. If this pro e that i m wrong about sillage, for sure i will buy it again. a fast re edit : folks ....both,longevity and sillage : WEAK :(  I'm so upset,when I thought I finally found a scent on my taste ...  the juice is PERFECT !!! but that`s not enough man,like i said ,i don`t want to be smelled from far away,but to be there.  I had the opportunity to return it,but it takes some time...I just keep it for odor. FIRST AND LAST BOTTLE. A 3 fkin're-edit: in the meantime i moved to England, so i was wearing this at work. One of my colleagues was standing around me and still smelling something. Then I realized that she smelled my perfume. My intuition was correct. She told me that I have a very nice fragrance. And I was something like: wow, thx. After that, she obviously wondered what a perfume it is. The idea is that this perfume shows its value at a wet temperature, because in my country the humidity is low. And yes, I can say that I also felt the perfume persist. So I apologize, but ready, that's the final decision. It is worth buying and worn only in the cold, wet seasons, not the summer. The end of the story."", ""This is the first cologne i ever owned! It is definitely a pleasant smell and is nice and fresh with a clear orange tang. The only problem with this one is that it has poor longevity and can't be smelt very well unless someone rubs their face on your skin or you dowse yourself in half the bottle. Not a bad cologne at all though, just make sure you spray enough on you."", 'I had this the first Christmas it game out, cant remember which one but it was defo pre 2002, love this fragrance, it reminds me of Christmas because it is when I first got it, just like many other frags i received from santa, boss bottled, D&C the one, this, ysl live jazz - but the orangery spice of this makes it a good winter fragrance as well inmho, there are better frags out there now and I havent had this in years but Its still a great one.', ""Lots of Orange and Bergamot, sweet yet in an attractive way. Smells like a young mans fragrance. Sillage - Average, within 3ft Longevity - 4-6 hours Verdict: not much to say other than the top notes seemed to stay with me and it didn't develop that much further except for a slight sandalwood note coming through after 20 minutes or so, definitely a warm weather fragrance best used during the daytime. Over-spraying didn't damage the experience although i would advise you to LIGHTLY spray your clothes to make it last longer. Not one to pay over the odds for 3/5"", ""Creamy vanilla orange smell. Surprised at the lack of vanilla in the notes pyramid. It's smooth, mildly-sweet, orangish smell. It's a very nice scent. However, it quite synthetic in that it smells a bit chemical & it irritates my nose if I spray more than 4 sprays. Very likeable but not something I'd recommend a blind buy."", 'scent : 9/10 sillage : 7/10 longevity :7/10 70% day / 30% night fragrance nice pepper and fruity scent', 'i agree with konga 5000 this stuff is a sicking mess totally turns me makes me run away if i smell it ,sorry to you guys who like but to each his own .', ""Its certainly not a favourite but people seem to like it on me. I tend to mix it with a tiny amount of Tom Ford's Jasmine Rouge. Together they balance, adding depth to Hugo whilst taking the girly out of the Ford."", ""Very pleasant orange scent that dries down with a powdery creamy vibe to balance out the citrus. I like the creamsicle references in the prior reviews. Reminds me of Clinique happy for men, but the powdery dry down is better here as it's less musky.  Even better, I like the boss in motion white, with a fresher citurus scent not just oranges but maybe pineapple and lime, although the scent fades more without as much of a powdery base as original boss in motion.  A good scent for orange fragrance lovers."", 'Off the bat, I hate the flanker. Pushing from the underside I must\'ve missed the test strip 2 or 3 times. Looks odd, in use its just awkward to hold. Original, yes, practical, no. But you know what? The actual fragrance is decent. It has surprising sillage and longevity - and I mean, 6-8 hours. Sure, it was released way back, and Boss Orange is the new king. But this is worth a shout. Fresh spicy orange on initial application (and it really is an awesome orange), drying-down into a less potent version of itself, bringing forth the musk, vetiver and woody elements. I don\'t know if I\'ll ever buy it, but it certainly is cheap for the quality product you get in return. My only quandry is the tag line - ""a fresh and sensual scent for the short and happy man\' - so tall guys can\'t wear this? :p', ""I purchased this on the whole Boss frags are very pleasant and you generally can't go wrong with them. I purchased this and thought nothing more of it. I went to a very upmarket store and decided to try an article on. At the time I was on crutches and I ended up trying a few items on. Unable to carry them out and seeing my distress the young lady told me she would fetch the items out. SHe came back and said wow that changing room smelt fantastic, what was I wearing?

Usually on hump day I reach for something with a bit of pronounced note thing going on (Aramis Havana of late) to help me ease into the downward part of the week heading to Saturday. Today given my ‚Äúdiet‚Äù, I tore open a box containing Boss In motion that I received free with a pair of sunglasses I bought in an airport a few years ago. From memory it was pleasantly orangey but the joys of air travel is that 5 minutes after I board a plane I can‚Äôt smell a thing so other than the initial notes I had no idea what to expect.  First impression was that it was indeed a fuzzy orange with a little bit of spice. Quite invigorating! By the time I had walked to the train station it had settled into an almost wintery mulled drink sort of scent but rather weak‚Ä¶kinda like being half a mile away from a German winter market where you get faint whiffs but not the full on smell of spice or burning wood. Now after 3 hours or so it‚Äôs moved to the base of mild musk, light spice and clean wood. More sandalwood than vetiver. All in all apart from the initial fruit I‚Äôm a bit uninspired really. Far from unpleasant but nothing to really write home about. Scent ‚Äì A pleasant opening with clean base 7/10 Sillage ‚Äì Not much 5/10 (although I‚Äôm used to more powerful fragrances so it might be that I‚Äôm slightly shy with the trigger) Longevity - 6/10 again a larger application might be required. Value for money ‚Äì 10/10 (I got it free), however given it retails for ¬£27/90ml on Amazon, I feel you can get better enjoyment for the same price. To sum up, it‚Äôs far from unpleasant just not particularly engaging. Might keep a hold of it for social events where close contact with strangers is required for long periods of time such as the theatre.', 'A word that evokes me this fragrance : modern .

I really enjoy this fragrance because it dosen't have a bitter scent. I like it so much I bought my 3rd bottle and after I finish this bottle I'll definitely buy another bottle. Highly recommended!!!  This was the first motion that came out in 2002, I wore it all summer long. 12 years later I had the urge to pick up a bottle. I bought a bottle this morning and I wore it during work. A really attractive aroma of orange comes through making it perfect as a summer fragrance. The added notes of nutmeg, cardamom and red pepper gives it a real attractive powdery/spicy aroma. The orange note is as true to what orange smells like. It stays on my skin at least 6hrs which is a big plus and you don't need to spray it 2x. Longevity and Silage is good to excellent lasting overall 8hrs.  My final throughs, Out of all the motion collection's, this one tops the list being #1. I have several frag's with orange being the main note. Most of them have a stronger pronounced note making them slight spicer and tangy. Boss in motion is a really gorgeously aromatic scent with a sweet creamy vib making it ABSOLUTELY amazing.

I don't get the Orange scent as much as I was expecting, though it is a Top Note so I guess that is why. I find that I am picking up on the Cinnamon, Sandal Wood, and the Musk a lot more than anything else. This perfume also smells 'Powdery' to me as well. I am not sure if that is because of the combination of ingredients or if it is how the perfume is reacting to my skin. This is a nice perfume and I enjoy it; however, it isn't something I would wear for flash or to make a statement. It seems like an everyday-wear perfume in my opinion.

But he's tall, dark and handsome, a serious, bookish type, not, um 'a shortish happy man' with an active lifestyle - so don't be put off! You can definitely smell the orange and the vetiver, but I don't get much of the spice, and it smells modern rather than a classic oldie like Eau Sauvage, that you can't really imagine on a man under forty. I really like this. I keep stealing it from him... :)"", 'Ahhhhhh I use to love this one...it smelled like an orange!! So nice!', ""Slightly citrusy beginning stays with the woody drydown, its not an extreme anything.

He just smells soooo good! Only two things that I can sum up about this perfume: Masculine and elegant! I don't find it spicy, but so deep warm scent, long lasting, not overpowering, not cheap, hhmmm.. it's just simply scent of a man. Perfect for office!"", 'very subtle EDT.

Perfect for an evening out.', 'Its hard to find a fragance in the boss house that deserve a great reference. We know that their fragance line are totally mainstream, boring and without flavor... but we can choose Boss bottled, hugo and this in motion to think that theres some great fragances to try in this house.  In motion is very spicy, sweet and balanced. the initial point is very luminous, fresh, fruity and strong.. in some seconds a floral and woody touch is more evident, the fresh base is down by a spicy semi oriental angle, at this moment the smell is fresh and warm, fruity and woody, spicy and floral. A fragance of contrast and intensity.', ""This opens with a very sweet orange and a bit of spice. It smells like it's got vanilla in the heart and this is responsible for the sweetness. Even if it's not in this perfume it smells like it could have a tinge of vanilla.  The drydown sees this scent turn softer, the sweetness comes forward and it gets muskier for a while.  The cinnamon makes a few appearances as it driesfurther too and comes forward with the pink pepper making this soft sweet smell with a bit of a kick. It's nice, something that holds it's masculinity, has a sweetness but..if you smell proeprly you can detect the spices really well, especially the cinnamon and pink pepper. :)"", ""SO nice, start's with an orange spice, sits with a herbal musk, lasts for AGES, seriously, I get nothing done when I wear this 'cus im too busy sniffing myself to do any work.

Yes it is synthetic, but still very smooth and invigorating. Longevity and projection are both solid (longevity is eight hours plus on my skin).  I agree with others this could be a unisex scent.

I really enjoy this fragrance because it dosen't have a bitter scent. I like it so much I bought my 3rd bottle and after I finish this bottle I'll definitely buy another bottle. Highly recommended!!!  This was the first motion that came out in 2002, I wore it all summer long. 12 years later I had the urge to pick up a bottle. I bought a bottle this morning and I wore it during work. A really attractive aroma of orange comes through making it perfect as a summer fragrance. The added notes of nutmeg, cardamom and red pepper gives it a real attractive powdery/spicy aroma. The orange note is as true to what orange smells like. It stays on my skin at least 6hrs which is a big plus and you don't need to spray it 2x. Longevity and Silage is good to excellent lasting overall 8hrs.  My final throughs, Out of all the motion collection's, this one tops the list being #1. I have several frag's with orange being the main note. Most of them have a stronger pronounced note making them slight spicer and tangy. Boss in motion is a really gorgeously aromatic scent with a sweet creamy vib making it ABSOLUTELY amazing. I could never get tired of wearing this fragrance..‚ô• Rating this fragrance is definitely high..at least 9/10. I highly recommend it if you can find it...believe me you won't regret it!"", ""This fragrance is very subtle. I don't get the Orange scent as much as I was expecting, though it is a Top Note so I guess that is why. I find that I am picking up on the Cinnamon, Sandal Wood, and the Musk a lot more than anything else. This perfume also smells 'Powdery' to me as well. I am not sure if that is because of the combination of ingredients or if it is how the perfume is reacting to my skin. This is a nice perfume and I enjoy it; however, it isn't something I would wear for flash or to make a statement. It seems like an everyday-wear perfume in my opinion. It feels very safe and quiet to me. I would recommend this fragrance to be worn at work or someplace where sublety is key. It isn't for making a splash but more like starting a ripple in a pool."", ""Creamy vanilla orange smell. Surprised at the lack of vanilla in the notes pyramid. It's smooth, mildly-sweet, orangish smell. It's a very nice scent. However, it quite synthetic in that it smells a bit chemical & it irritates my nose if I spray more than 4 sprays. Very likeable but not something I'd recommend a blind buy."", ""A lot of sweet citruses mixed with light pepper. It is light and fresh scent, but warm at the same time. I also think women could wear it aswell - I see a similarity with Flower Princess by Vera Wang. It's nice everyday scent for the Spring time. And I have to say it reminds me very much of Oriflame Signature for him. GREETINGS FROM THE CZECH REPUBLIC! :)"", 'if you are 21 or less is a good fragrance.', 'I had this but had to give it up on account of it just smelling too much like orange creamsicle that doesn‚Äôt really go anywhere, complexity-wise. I prefer vetiver, woody, scents so maybe I don‚Äôt vibe with InMotion for that reason. I‚Äôm 41 and found that this wasn‚Äôt suitable for any occasion, unfortunately.', ""Will be quick on this one I hate that one synthetic mess headache guarantee you'll just throw up just with half of one sniff I cant believe i put $ on that bs SORRY lol hopefully it's discontinued"", ""Pour femme.. not even close unisex.

If understated refinement is your mode de faire, this fragrance suits that ethos.', 'This perfume is the literal definition of a hidden gem. Not only it smells great, it works for all occasions and is signature scent worthy.  5/5 üî• Also heavily recommend checking out other perfumes from this house', 'This is undoubtedly one of the most refined and beautiful barbershop sandalwood fragrances available‚Äîelegantly spicy, with a distinctly masculine sophistication. Unfortunately, its performance leaves much to be desired. After the initial spectacular opening, the scent quickly dissipates, leaving only faint traces that require deliberate effort to detect. Reapplication becomes necessary‚Äîoften as frequently as every 15 minutes‚Äîto maintain its presence. I so wish it had more staying power. Edit: When I realized that this is like a sweeter, calming, smoother Bois du Portugal (a regal though potent sandalwood, which can come across as abrasive to some) I could not resist purchasing a small bottle. Such a desirable scent! Despite the underwhelming performance I am considering buying a bigger bottle when my 10 ml runs out.', 'I have always called it ""The cutie"" among all my colognes. It is not super noticeable, impossible to call it a beast but, it smells pleasant and beautiful. I like the perfume in spite of its performance, it makes me think of a gentleman very refined and elegant.', ""everyone's right, the performance here is kind of atrocious but it's also one of the best things I've ever smelled so....... the performance can actually be a little weird though in that it'll be gone within a couple hours and then several hours later I'll still be catching slight whiffs of it out of nowhere. anyone who gets close enough will surely be able to smell it. if i smelled this up close on a guy I would be obsessed. the accords above list this as primarily spicy, but the spiciness is more of a soft accent the vanilla and woodiness to me. the lavender here is so nice too but u wish it were a bit more prominent. one of the most pleasant lavenders I've smelled.  people call this gentlemanly but i think that might be more due to the floris brand. it feels youthful to me. not very energetic, maybe a little sullen as well, but it's not serious or stuffy at all. it's soft and cozy and a little sexy. warm but with a cool side. you could wear this with a tux for sure but it's just at home with a big hooded sweater."", 'Great scent but gone in less than an hour, despite over spraying. Floris scents smell good, but do not last on my skin.', ""A gentleman's night out. Classy, restrained, manly, self assured without being loud (to many male fragrances are bombastic and annoyingly so) Floris is always in good taste. My husband will probably have a vast collection of this brand by the time we are done exploring it. If you like subtle spicy musky sandalwood this is wonderful."", 'I experience the same thing what a few users experience, very very short longevity. On skin, its gone after 30mins unfortunately. I really love the smell : Its spicy, creamy, and a little aromatic. Gentlemanly and perfect for all occasions and office safe.', 'On my skin, it lasts for a few minutes and then I cannot smell it. What I smell is great, and I love the cardamom. Unfortunately, even with 6-8 sprays, it doesn‚Äôt last. It will be a bed time scent.', 'I have recently tested this on a paper strip.  Light and airy, it definitely reminds French style of perfumery, generally Western style. It is very nicely built perfume. It has complexity and smoothness, yet it\'s fresh, elegant and inoffensive. The project is definitely not focused on the theme of mass appeal.  Among raw materials, there are certain citrus and white floral notes coming through, you can definitely point them in the opening. I would think about Hedione or its more refined version Hedione HC, Florol, Magnolan and other soft white florals, lot\'s of Terpenes, surely Linalool, Ethyl-Linalool, Linalyl Acetate and tens of others potentially. Interestingly, I imagine a watery note in the opening too.  It dries down more to a creamy woody base, were you can pick up creamy texture of Sandalwood and dry woody notes. It seems, that this perfume stays light and fresh through all its duration, everything is well put together and overall profile of a fragrance is very smooth.  I imagine it as a daily signature, that really fits in a professional environment. (Office, conferences, clinical environment) Elegant, ""go to work"" perfume.  Do I like it?  I am not sure, is it my favourite Sandalwood olfactive interpretation, but objectively, it smells very nice.  It doesn\'t seem to be a monstrous projector, it\'s more like an intimate fragrance with good amount of naturals. If you like elegant, complex, yet fresh perfumes - it is something I recommend to try.', ""The listed top notes and the lavender lift me to heaven at the opening.... Is this my signature scent?  But before too long it fades to skin, where it smells like a stale sugary distant memory. On my shirt it smells a bit too like the generic bubblegum fragrances for young men.  And yet, it's got a definite mature, timeless, sophisticated, gentlemanly quality. So I'm a bit confused. Trying it out again, day 2. Beautiful. It's sort of in the same vibe as Guerlain Heritage edt. I'd probably opt for that. I almost love this one more, for its mood boost; but H has much better longevity.  There's an intense version which costs ¬£185, for 90ml (i think) and scores well for longevity in reviews. It's meant to be a very similar apart from the better performance"", 'only my perfume lasts 15 min?', ""Fresh and grassy to begin with, it expands into a medley of spices (most notably cardamom and nutmeg), and finishes with a strangely sweet, creamy olibanum/sandalwood/musk. Some note separation; but questionable longevity and projection. The performance is a singular flaw of my purchase (Batch WMB21454-2) from late 2024. The concentration of oils seems truly parsimonious and ought to embarrass Floris. Patrons invested in the Floris culture (at least to an extent) are likely familiar with traditions of 'correct attire' and that a gentleman's scent mustn't ever be intrusive. In this respect Eau de Santal is assuredly discreet ‚Äì just ridiculously so. As much as I like this classy EdT, it is flawed. It needs more oils, Floris! More oils, I say!!"", 'This fragrance evokes the essence of an oriental fougere, with a classic and timeless scent profile. The opening top note of grass carries a subtle bay leaf quality, adding an aromatic freshness. As the fragrance develops into the mid and dry-down stages, the rich lavender and smooth sandalwood blend seamlessly, with a hint of vanilla providing a creamy texture that adds warmth and depth. True to the style of most Floris fragrances I‚Äôve encountered, Eau de Santal is both elegant and understated, embodying a refined simplicity that lingers without overpowering. Bravo!', 'Fresh, clean, spicy, woody aromatic with a touch of classic barbershop undertone..  Performance is subtle but it‚Äôs there‚Ä¶  The sandalwood is soft and clean.. Definitely a hint of spiciness / pencil shavings..  Solid.', 'Does anyone know if there are any differences between the new red label and the old blue label? Hopefully the packaging is the only thing that has changed.', 'For a perfume released in 2002, it is very classic. Yet I think Floris successfully modernised the barbershop concept here in a manner that ensures it will always have a place in perfumery.  There are similarities with barbershop classics such as Old Spice and Tabac, yet it is more modern and probably it is vetiver that gives it a grassier or at least fresher feel despite all the warm spices in there. Can be used the year around in my opinion, great morning routine scent.', 'it smells like they make two bottles of one perfume and add water, actual for floris out of 5 perfumes only 2 are good', 'Who TF said this reminds them of Sa-vag elixir!! Stop smoking crack ü™®', 'Smells better than Envy.', ""Starts off a soapy, grassy, herbal and lightly citrus barbershop scent soon transcending to a peppery, spiced frankincense sandalwood fragrance. The deep drydown is mostly tobacco-y, incense-y, peppered sandalwood, while still holding on to the freshness of the topnotes. Floris Santal boasts an authentic classic 90s men's fragrance vibe. It smells luxe and dimensional, and oh so masculine. A lovely composition any fragrance enthusiast and nostalgia seeker will appreciate. Not your basic, boring dill pickle sandalwood. None of that at all! So beautifully blended and well thought out. A fragrance that will not suffocate those around you if you over spray. It's fresh, then warm, friendly, and refined. Try it!"", 'One of my favourites, but it‚Äôs ridiculously weak. 3 sprays on the wrist and can‚Äôt smell it 3 hours later.', ""Classic (read: subtle), airy, mildly-Oriental barbershop sandalwood. In the opening you get a sharp burst of cardamom, lemon, and bitter grassy green notes which leaves you wondering why it's called Santal at all. They stop shouting fairly quickly, and then sandalwood, vanilla, lavender, and spices slowly bloom over the course of the day. What you're left with is a milky, soapy, smooth-powdered sandalwood scent that soaks into the skin, a fresh crack of nose-tingling black pepper, all lightly warmed by frankincense & spices that whisper a touch of the far east - think lacquer boxes being traded from wooden ships at Hong Kong harbour. The sandalwood pulls rank, acting like cream swirled into coffee, harmoniously blending everything into a cosy and classy territory. Personally I've come to love this, and it's a great everyday spray for the price. In terms of projection, it's not going to announce you to the next village as you leave your house, but you WILL enjoy a quiet confidence in the dry down, and project a sophisticated aura for those lucky enough to be close to you. Intense version available for those who desire more power. 9/10."", ""This sauce is getting me all-day performance from three sprays, and it is a lovely concoction. Sandalwood is the star of the show, accentuated by clove/tobacco/vanilla to the dry down, and once it settles in it's a familiar and comforting post-shave barbershop, but classed up to eleven. My favorite part of it is the fresh opening, which I did not expect, these bright notes of cut-grass and a sharp citrus that just pop and rouse the senses. The composition is high art, and that doesn't happen by accident. This one was a labor of love. It's mature, yet full of vitality and vibrancy. Year-round versatility, too, as far as I'm concerned."", ""This is a Floris I like. It's a solid multi purpose fragrance. It's subtle with barbershop vibes. A clean sandalwood that's pretty good overall but performance is sadly pretty poor, a skin scent only. 6/10 due to performance. 7/10 if it was better."", 'This is exceptionally classic and masculine .

Gently spicy, lightly sweet and perfect for winding down.

However, something in this is rather generic and I can't tell if I like this a lot or find it rather boring. Perhaps both? Try it for yourself, and see what I mean..."", 'I wore this perfume yesterday and it was good. Good like a clear sunny sky, and like a gentle breeze that you enjoy for a few minutes and then you simply neglect. Nice scent but nothing special that brings you to the front page.', ""Floris now offers an EDP version of Santal called Santal Intense and it's beautiful!"", 'Seriously bad performance on my skin ,to be honest there is very little scent at all even my wife can hardly smell it. Certainly not their best effort shame really because it sounds good on paper going by the notes.', 'I was intrigued by the blend of notes and ordered my boyfriend a sample. I love it on him as it‚Äôs an intimate, and soft scent that I love smelling on his skin and in his beard. It has a clean soapiness and gentle aromatic warmth that makes me picture him emerging from a hot, steamy shower and getting ready for the day ahead.  A classic fragrance that doesn‚Äôt smell like a generic men‚Äôs cologne, and works all year round. Spritzing into hands and patting onto facial hair after oil really makes the scent last longer, and I personally do think for the price it last reasonably well.', 'I\'ve spent the past several days wearing either Dunhill\'s Indian Sandalwood or D.R. Harris\' Sandalwood, both of which I really like. But this morning after shaving and bathing I used Floris\' Santal after shave, followed a few minutes later with 3 sprays of the EdT, and it has been one delightful morning. The sandalwood isn\'t front and centre with this one, but it is rather a thin veil over each and every one of the other notes. This gives it a quite rare ethereal quality that I\'ve found in few other fragrances, most notably in Penhaligon\'s Endymion cologne. Santal doesn\'t smell ""like"" Endymion, but the two have a similar almost angelic quality with which I am quite taken. And as Thomas Aquinas tells us, each angel is a species unto itself. Such a desirable scent. In typical Floris fashion, it is ever so discreet. Many confuse Floris\' discretion with a lack of performance. I don\'t think that\'s the case. The fragrance is there, but it becomes a part of me, and not something that either precedes or follows me. I appreciate that. And in any case, if I feel like I can\'t smell it there\'s still more in the bottle!', ""A very nice, subtle scent. It's quite refreshing and understated. I love the dry down on me (sandalwood and somewhat of a soapy scent), but the projection and longevity is abysmal.  For that reason, like using it after showers for a warm and relaxing scent. But when going out, I definitely need something a little shout-ier than this one."", ""Save for the minor short opening of citrus and cardamom, nothing else reminds me of Envy here. Its like a sweeter and thicker version of Endymion and not in a good way. The Penhaligon's transparent and airy qualities make it the overall better choice for me over this sticky Floris."", ""It's a soapy sandalwood dignified by a judicious use of spices. It's not very exciting, but it's still noble--it would be a good scent to wear to work, especially if you wanted to project a quiet gravitas. Although I would agree this is not something that I would describe as a powerhouse, this lasted for me a reasonable amount of time and projected reasonably well on my skin."", 'Yup. Performance is bad on my skin. Scent doesn‚Äôt project at all. Straight to skin scent', ""Signature scent material right here. I'm a huge fan of cedar and sandalwood and this one is fantastic. The pepper, nutmeg, and lavender blends seamlessly with cedar, vanilla, incense, sandalwood, and musk to make a concoction that gives of the creamy woody vibe of masculine, well mannered, gentleman. This reminds me of the drydown of Histories De Parfums 1828 which is one of my favorite fragrances of all time. However, floris is a little more airy and lighter which should give it a little more versatility (although 1828 is pretty versatile). Can be worn in just about any situation or weather. Full bottle on the way.  Another hit from the storied British House of Floris. üá¨üáß Scent 9/10 Performance TBD"", ""It‚Äôs a nice scent, somewhat reminiscent of barbershop fragrances of yesteryears; but it‚Äôs not anything mind-blowing & I mainly bought it off of the hype of it smelling similar to Envy, as I wanted to see what the hype was about. It‚Äôs nice & that‚Äôs all it is.  However, the performance on this is abysmal. This is probably THE worst perfume I‚Äôve owned in terms of projection and longevity. When you first spray it on, the projection is moderate with a personal scent bubble, but it‚Äôs completely a skin scent by the end of the first hour with it being completely gone by the time 2.5 hours have passed. Spraying it on heavily doesn‚Äôt make any difference to the performance & projection, either. Perhaps it‚Äôs a matter of skin chemistry, but my results have been similar to a friend‚Äôs experience. This is basically scented water.  If this was the only scent I had and was cursed to never get anything else, I'd still be sad and would've wished I rather had nothing at all."", ""When I was a kid, my mom had a Chinese fan made of sandalwood. I used to often remove it from its box and smell it. The scent was captivating to me. The dry down strongly reminds me of that fan's lovely smell. For that reason, I would say it has an authentic sandalwood smell. Perfectly unisex. Soft projection but quite long lasting from 3 sprays on my wrist. I think I have to get it."", 'Yes this resembles Envy, a much more subtle, less macho formula.. only this lacks the ginger, mossy feeling & incense smokey depth of the legendary juice & adds a creamy dapper vanilla. FS initially opens a bit fresh & for literally a few seconds I can smell the citrus. Quickly after the light warmth & intensity of the sandalwood, vanilla & spices kick in. Lavender & Vanilla are what keeps this profile balanced, interesting & delicious. Quite intoxicating. Heavy vanilla gives me day long headaches, but here in the dry down it‚Äôs just the right amount mixed with the perfect notes. Edit: 11/15/24 I got this sweet patchouli amber smell at the dry down.. Pleaseeee nooooo! I hate patchouli smells. Hope this never happens again üôèüèΩ', '2 minutes then it fades away‚Ä¶', ""In the beginning the lavender/lemon/green notes have this feeling way too soapy. *But* after a few minutes it opens up with vanilla and spices, nose tickling pepper, and dry sandalwood. It honestly reminds me of the cult classic bergamot/vanilla/cardamom/sandalwood bomb from the 90s, JOOP! Homme but much better. Imagine a turned down gentlemen's JOOP! without the screechy synthetic qualities or jasmine. I think it is lovely. A fresh, mildly sweet and sophisticated scent for any man, from a construction worker to a suit donning professional. *Edit* any resemblance to JOOP! died away rather quickly! Now it's a slightly sweet vanilla/pepper lavender/lemon freshie. Changing from a like to a love for how many times this scent has evolved, and the final result is just so damn nice."", 'This one failed the nose-wrinkle test: if my first impression of any fragrance is that involuntary reaction, I form an immediate dislike to it.  Eau de Santal begins with a blast of artificial spicy notes and seems just like any other Woody/Spicy fragrance you ever tested.  It settles down after a while into an unthreatening, low-key clovey musk ... but that nose-wrinkling effect is never far away for me.', ""One of the most beautiful scents ever, spicy, creamy sandalwood with nutmeg and clove, almost gourmand how delicious it is, the only downside is it's very weak in projection, but it doesn't matter, maybe even better ;) 10/10"", ""Opens up like Boucheron Jaipur, moves to smelling like L'eau D'issey without the bitterness then hits a Bleu de Channel dry down vibe with the base notes and Cardamom. If you like this type of fragrance, you'll like it, if not you won't. It's not bad, safe but not mass appealing. I don't see some young kid wearing this. The performance is underwhelming. The opening is strong, dries down to skin scent quickly. Basically this is going to be loved by certain people and for most of us, we'll be bored and/or disappointed by this. Glad I got to try it. It's very nice, casually classy. I really love the soft warm dry down with the slight smokiness."", 'Have had Santal in my collection for a while and returned to it now that my nose has matured a little. I love the history of Floris and think Santal lives up to this in being a very classic scent. I get the fresh, green top notes when it is first sprayed, and eventually goes warmer.  For me, I‚Äôd wear Santal for everyday use and to enjoy whilst running an errand. Safe to wear in the office but unfortunately, longevity is quite weak on me.', 'Lovely soft, gentlemanly, traditional Sandalwood. Yes, you will most likely have come across similar before and often at a cheaper price, but this is done incredibly well and I like it more every time I wear it. Although Floris isn‚Äôt the cheapest house, it can often be found at discounters well below RRP making this an ideal office scent for the transitional seasons (Spring & Autumn). Its fresh, clean, sophisticated and will make anyone smell very professional. This and Burberry touch will be my go to Spring work scents this year until the warmer weather hits in the UK (usually around late April/May).', 'Generic male perfume üò© I had a hard time detecting any sandalwood. This was such a disappointment, as it‚Äôs one of those scents that you can find a million places for less money. It felt kind of sharp and cloying, definitely a scrubber for me üßΩ First time trying a scent from Floris I didn‚Äôt like ü•≤', 'Really nice, smooth, very well blended, vaguely interesting but definitely not exciting.', 'About a month ago, I was looking for a warm spicy-vanilla fragrance for late fall/winter. I bought decants of Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille, Spicebomb Extreme and Herod. While I can see why people like those fragrances, to me TV was way too sweet and SE‚Äôs opening was way too harsh. Herod I liked quite a bit. The thing is I only would want to wear it when in the mood for sweet tobacco, which is rare. My search for a new winter frag continued. I saw a review for Floris Santal from Wafts from the Loft, and I ordered a bottle. After first spraying it, I wasn‚Äôt so sure I‚Äôd like it as the spices in the opening are quite bold (though not harsh like SE). After a few minutes I liked it more. After 15-20 minutes the spices settled down and I began to appreciate this gem. I soon decided Floris Santal was what I‚Äôd been looking for. The citruses nicely compliment the cardamom, nutmeg pepper and clove in the opening before the smooth lavender and vanilla become apparent. The spices are perfectly blended and balanced and not overly bold at all. Just perfect. The spices and lavender continue as the citrus fades, then vanilla and woods become more apparent in the drydown. As the drydown continues, it becomes much like what TV would be like if 90% of its √ºber-sweetness were removed and woods were added. Tasty spices and vanilla, and the sandalwood, are what remain after a few hours. I just love this. I love the way it evolves. It‚Äôs become my signature fall/winter scent. It‚Äôs perfectly elegant. I‚Äôll wear it until early spring before putting it away until the fall.', 'I picked this up as part of the 5-sample ""Jermyn Street Collection"" from Floris. I sprayed this on and something about it screamed ""late 90s"". I guess I was off by a few years, since this is from 2002. I get warm but also fresh and green. Spicy but restrained, only a touch of sweetness. Woody, maybe a touch floral, mildly musky. This one has a lot going on. I feel like I get something different every time I sniff. Something about this reminds me of Penaligon\'s Opus 1870, but I find this far more pleasant. It also reminds me a touch of Creed Viking, probably the clove. This has a masculine feel, rather like a barbershop scent with the spice and a very slight powderiness. But it also somehow feels unisex. I could completely see a woman wearing this. Very wearable. This is my favorite of the samples I got. I will doubtless keep wearing this until the sample is empty and consider whether I want more then.', ""Fall winter scent: 6,5 The smell is mature, classic and masculine.

Good for a professional setting. Not quite strong enough for the depths of winter.', ""Opens with dry sandalwood...reminds me a tiny bit of Santal 33 or GFT Sandalwood. Then the spices come on and it's a nice, natural, proper English, sandalwood. A hint of sweetness from the spices, but not sweet. Some of the citrus opening lingers in the drydown. Natural and well mannered. Very pleasant. Could be an alternative to GFT Sandalwood. A very well mannered, subdued Spicebomb? Definitely a like, maybe a love?

This house always disappoints.', ""i received a free sample of this with an order. at first spray it's quite traditionally masculine and woody/fresh. after a couple minutes i get some vanilla, nutmeg and lavender which smooth it out. it becomes a bit more unisex and workable for me. the drydown is a bit woodier and at this point its pretty but the opening is too fresh/strong for me."", ""I bought this some time ago because I miss Envy and for about an hour that's what you get. I've tried a few Floris(es), the openings are bright and jaunty but they don't last terribly long. If Floris could amp this up, plenty Envy addicts would pile in. As it is Dua's Covet is good, close to Envy and lasts. Trying to appraise Floris Santal objectively is hard but surely anyone with a half decent nose is going to enjoy this one. Given lightness it's probably best suited to spring or summer, just be prepared to respray. 3.5/5"", 'The opening is very similar to Gucci Envy but it becomes a bit soapier in the mid and veers off into its own direction in the dry down. A nice fragrance when judged on its own merits, but it is not a replacement for Gucci Envy which is much richer, deeper and louder than Santal - and does not have the same soapiness. I definitely get Creed Original Santal vibes from this one.', 'Well I have finally had the chance to wear this for a while now and during some warmer Spring weather where I have found the fragrance opens up a lot more and performs much better with both projection and longevity.  I managed to get a discounted bottle online and it is worth every penny, there is nothing else in the market you can buy that smells like this. I managed to test the discontinued Gucci Envy a mate had in his collection, indeed it has strong similarities but also notable differences and by no means is Santal a clone. Needless to say, Envy was a wonderful frag with cult status I remember well from my younger years and I am happy to have something that reminds me of it. This formulation of Santal works well with my skin and I am happy to say I have finally found my signature fragrance for Spring and Autumn / Fall happy days. Peace and Slava Ukrainia!', ""@ Btmfdr well I guess and hope you learn't the lesson that you need to test the fragrance batch on your skin before pulling the trigger. Batches always change with fragrances that have a good amount of natural ingredients.  Simply the batch you tried for 2021 did not work with your skin, it does not mean it won't with other peoples skin and that goes for any fragrance with a good amount of naturals."", 'I purchased this a few years ago due to its similarity to Gucci envy, and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Lovely fragrance. However I purchased a 2021 batch at Christmas and i have to say the performance is inexcusable. It disappears within minutes, even after 5 or 6 sprays. For a niche brand like this it‚Äôs shocking. I returned it. A great fragrance ruined entirely due to its lack of staying power. I hope they fix this', ""I have tested this for a week now and I can comfortably say I enjoy the scent journey and the airy, smooth, soft nature of this scent. Projection is about 1 hour and then the scent sits fairly close to the skin however, I would expect in warmer Spring / Autumn weather for it to have better sillage and projection as I am testing this is winter. The longevity on my olive skin was about 6 hours, naturally on clothes it will be a couple of hours longer, but all in all pretty good for an EDT, I would not have an issue respraying with a travel sprayer as I am not expecting longevity like most EDP fragrances. The scent is very clean, fresh and not too rich of any particular accord as the blending is just perfect, as expected from a niche house like Floris that uses high quality ingredients. The scent overall is just lovely and very pleasant, sophisticated yet calming, it made me feel good and relaxed and in no way did it smell dated. I have been looking for a nice versatile fragrance with the aforementioned characteristics to be a new signature scent, as opposed to the mainstream ISO E, ambroxian tonka bombs out there and I think I may have found it, but I will need to give this a few more wears in another season. So far I am both impressed with Santal and surprised considering how much flak it has received from some reviews on here, to me this is a highly underated fragrance and I feel its not only to do with the fragrance itself but also with the brand association some people may have with Floris who struggle to identify themselves with such an old fashioned house thats not hip and trendy let alone overly popular. I would think this fragrance would be suited for a professional man aged 26 and up looking for a subtle versatile signature scent that can be for daily use, formal lunches, interviews, the office or even just smart casual events. Anyway don't just take my word for it like all fragrances you must test this and see how it performs with your skin. Peace :)"", 'Beautiful scent. Perfect blend of fresh, sweet, and spice. Very classy signature scent. No one can dislike it and is unique that people know it‚Äôs something they‚Äôve never smelled before', 'I always have had a soft spot for a well done sandalwood scent, and this is really refined, fresh and welcoming.', 'Just read the review by @JmThms (Jim Thomas?) I recognise everything he‚Äôs said in far greater detail than the review that I wrote. If you want a review that reflects this scent accurately, then this is the one. I‚Äôm English and have every reason to want this scent to be great, but apart from smelling nice, it doesn‚Äôt have a lot going for it, especially for the price!', ""This is one that needed a 2nd & 3rd wearing to grow on me. Floris is one of my favorite houses but I much prefer their newer releases, the older ones sometimes are too powdery for me. So, I wanted to give Santal a try & upon first wearing wasn't impressed (I even decided to sell it). This is a case where my laziness paid off. I didn't get to selling it right away & eventually tried it again & began to appreciate it. It's probably not a fragrance that many people under 35 would like, not typically at least. It is complex & it takes a bit of time to get to know it. It's changes are subtle but they are there. Sometimes I get, albeit for only moment, that great whiff of fresh cut grass soon after application, sometimes I don't. I do get a hefty dose of cedar & santal consistently. Sandalwood frags aren't my usual style but when the mood strikes this one hits the spot. I have no complaints about the longevity but I'm also not sticking my nose into my wrist every minute or two either. A few sprays behind each ear is lasting 5 to 6 hours & that's about as long as I want it to."", ""I've just sprayed it on 10 minutes ago for the first time. It is a nice scent profile, as I expected given the listed notes. But I can barely smell it when I put my nose to it just 10 minutes later. I expect that won't improve (update several hours later: nope didn't improve. Over 10 sprays and can barely detect anything). Whenever you see both longevity and projection rated as 'moderate' here in Fragrantica for a non aquatic ozonic freshie, you know there's a problem. It's obvious that the 4.34 overall rating here is due to the nice scent profile. With the performance likely being extremely and indefensibly poor, that rating should be closer to 4.00. A fragrance with these notes SHOULD have good longevity. The perfumer failed. Elite is my favorite Floris and has not a too dissimilar note profile, and it has good longevity (despite its Fragrantica ratings of 'moderate'). The scent IS nice. This is NOT feminine, as a few reviews below seem to suggest. Unisex maybe, but more masculine in my opinion. Someone mentioned D&G The One, and it is in the same general vibe neighborhood, less the tobacco, ginger and plus the lavender. Both sit very close to the skin. Maybe similar also to my recent formulation of YSL Jazz, which has been watered down and struggles for a skin scent after 10 minutes. Gucci Envy for Men is the best comparison scent profile wise, except Santal veers greener largely due I guess to the grass note, but man o man if only this Santal had the performance. I've since become a huge fan of the discontinued Gucci Envy for Men, acquiring bottles of it. And so my appreciation of Floris Santal has increased. But the performance is inexcusable. Ive never smelled Maison Martin Margiela Replica Whispers in the Library, but this scent seems it would fit that profile to a tee. It does have a dusty old parchment smell, as if it were replicating old library book page smell. And the scent sure is a whisper. Actually, I know that I've smelled old book pages with a stronger smell than this. If you buy this nice scent, keep in mind that you will need to spray the heck out of it per wearing. And even then it will struggle. Several hours later I can say the performance of Santal is extremely poor."", 'Firstly, don‚Äôt fall for buying the ‚Äúaftershave‚Äù that‚Äôs being pushed on the search engines etc on Amaz0n for the same price as the edt! Anyway. The package arrived this morning. First impression - I get something similar to Bentley Men Intense. There‚Äôs also some patchouli although none mentioned in the notes above. Now I see where the Coromandel reference in the comments came from. Well. I‚Äôll wear it and see what happens! Disappointing. Not because of the reasons others have given, but because it‚Äôs like a faded, 1 dimensional version of a fragrance that I already have 2 full bottles of. Have I got a bad bottle? This is weak as one could imagine. I‚Äôm going to try one more Floris. Probably no 89 (unless someone can recommend a better one) and if that is garbage, I won‚Äôt bother with any more. The cheapie bottle of Yardley Elite that I purchased with this has put Santal to shame and at 1125pm is still kicking out after 13 hours!

So a decent scent but not one I would buy a full bottle of myself.', ""This is the subtle sort of fragrance that fades into the background. I think this is why it's rated as low longevity if you're waring it you do tend to forget about it. For me at least it's actually still there 16hr after I put it on.  The combination of low silliage and such long life is new to me though I know they're independent. The scent it self is a very classic spicy wood. For me I don't get much of the citrus top notes though the pepper and spice heart comes up quickly and hints of lavender, sandalwood, and vanilla play hide and seek all day. Great office scent. People probably won't remark on your cologne, but they will think you smell good..."", ""If there is one fragrance whose performance issues I could forgive, it is Floris Santal. This one changed my perception on the strength of fragrances, where I began to appreciate beauty in subtlety. The note pyramid gives the impression of a rather bold, peppery, and heavily woodsy masculine aroma. However, it is as mentioned, quite understated, and never really promised to be much of a powerhouse. As obvious as the sandalwood is, it never really dominates the composition, and gives way to other notes like cardamom, nutmeg, pepper, and vanilla. So yes, it can in fact be called a creamy sandalwood fragrance, though the sandalwood is gracious enough to take a back seat in order to yield an aromatic and vanillic scent. Clearly, what we have here is a rather simplistic scent, but it somehow manages to trigger an inexplicable high in me, almost like a narcotic effect.

Wow!', ""A very pleasant spicy aromatic scent. Although it shares some similarities with Gucci's Envy for men, Floris Santal does however venture into a different direction.

It reminds me very much of Penhaligon's Endymion but has less of a creamy coffee like smell. The spiciness is a little fruity. To my mind there is almost an orange and spice smell to it. This is not a scent that I see as being a long lasting developing scent. However it is still a joy to wear this perfume."", ""On me, this is soft and discreet.

Not bad, not for me. 5/10"", ""I got a sample, I'v been wanting to explore Floris frags. It opens harsh, it has a ruberry synthetic harshness just the first few minutes, and then becomes quite good. When the opening settles I get one of the best creamy smooth sandalwoods, slightly reminding me of the best sandalwood fragrance in the world, Creed Boise du Portugal. So you get that nice wood, lavender, and some sweet vanela, cloves, moss.  I dont think I will be purchasing a bottle, as I have Boise Portugal. This fragrance reminded me, of when I was exploring the old classics. This Floris Santal reminds me most of vintage Givenchy Xeryus. It even feels like there is a good dose of oakmoss or tree moss in this one. You can still get this for under $60. / 100 ml tester, so thats a very good value, as this is not a great fragrance, but better quality than most designer frags. I would'nt buy it because of the ruberry opening. If you can look past that it may be worth a try. If you like the sandalwood in this, you would love Creed Boise du Portugal. This is also a bit like Habit Rouge, but darker, warmer. Update: I increased my rating, and am liking this more. It does have a classic feel, inbetween fougere and chypre. It is warm and cozy, it will be great in cold weather, yet it has enough freshness to where I'm enjoying it in Summer, though indoors with air conditioning. It has a nice vanela and some sweetness added for balance, and keeping it a classy, comfort scent. It also reminds me mostly of the 50+ I have in my collection, Tom Ford for Men Extreme. I think I will ad this to my permanent colection, Tom Ford for Men Extreem is nicer when I want to wear this type of fragrance, but Floris Santal is half the price, and the quality is close.  Signature type scent for Fall and Winter... Rating 8.5/10 God bless. John 3:16"", 'Stunning! This is beautiful from the first spray. There is a hint of lemon at the start, but you are greeted with a spicy sandalwood aroma as soon at it hits your skin. The spiciness (in particular the cloves)fades quickly but never vanishes. The combination of the lavender and cardamom give this an almost soapy quality, while the faint spices keep it from being dull. This has tremendous longevity (about 7hrs; winter 15oC), great projection (arms length after several hours) and mesmerising delicate sillage. It is very inviting, and draws admiring compliments in just about any setting. I have noticed that if I spray this on my shirt, the spiciness remains much longer, so if you want more of this character, one spray on a cuff or collar will do wonders. On your clothes (cotton) it will last 15hours Toward the end of the day the sandalwood and lavender remains dominant and with the vanilla becoming more prominent. Eventually, the cloves, nutmeg and pepper nuances disappear.  I recently wore it to the gym (after 8hrs work) and inspite of my perspiration it smelled very alluring - by that stage it was a soapy sandalwood scent.', ""Got a sample from lucky scent..oh this is the BEST lavender and sandalwood scent I have EVER hot my nose on. Period.  I want to know if it has ever been reformulated?  I ask because the bottle has changed . I think this could really get a lot of love if more people knew about it. Amazing scent ! Edit update** I still love this stuff! In terms of scent, one of the best in it's category of scent, but the longevity is pretty poor. If you enjoy this stuff I highly recommend you try eight and bob - Egypt. It's amazing and the longevity is about the same maybe a little bit longer, but adds a little more sexiness to it!"", ""Creamy, Woody, Spicy... I love this one. After only trying it a short while I have begun to really appreciate it. It's a wonderful mix here, a blend of creamy sandalwood and peppery woods and amber. A mix of cardamom, cloves and vanilla to compliment the lovely wood composition. Incredibly nice smelling too! I received a compliment whilst wearing it! I think this is one which would be fantastic on a well dressed man. It is a refined, elegant mix and works well in both warm and cool weather. I highly recommend it, and in my opinion could also be a signature scent. I can see the similarities with Gucci Envy for Men (which I used to own), but this one is both smoother and creamier. It is more subtle and that is one aspect I like about it, as if the exotic nature of the woods and spices have been tamed and refined. A very very good fragrance. I will enjoy this one a lot."", ""Floris Santal Review: This fragrance starts of with a fairly subdued spicy opening. The spiciness comes from the cardamom mixed with a hint of pepper. Just like with everything else in this scent, the pepper never feels brash or abrasive to your senses. Sitting behind this spicy concoction is just a little bit of citrus.  The opening then leads into a soft lavender mid, with a creamy sandalwood base. It amazingly accomplishes all of this with a fresh airiness to it all. It's a beautiful fragrance in it's simplicity and is one of my absolute favorites. This is one of the fragrances that gets compared to the classic Gucci Envy on occasion. From what I have tried, this is the smell that reminds me of Envy the most. It just so happens, that for my personal tastes, I actually prefer this one. It has a lighter and brighter smell to it than Gucci. This is a perfect fragrance to add to your Fall and Spring Rotations. Also, if you find the Extreme version I would definitely pick it up. It's a bit stronger than the original and would be quite a find.

Santal has a little bit of everything. Spice - clove, ginger and cardamom. Fruity/citrus notes - lemon, lime and lychee. Warmth - this scent excudes a cozy and sexy heat from sandalwood and lavender, the kind of warmth that makes a woman think ""...no matter what happens tonight I just want to be close to you..."" - this makes Santal a damn sexy fragrance with a little bit of a classical/barbershop vibe.  A first class fragrance fit for a true gent. I like the reviewer that says she smelled this on Placido Domingo - I can totally imagine him wearing this...', 'THIS DESERVES FAR MORE HYPE THAN IT GETS!!! beautiful. smells classy and like a gentleman without any ""dated"" notes', 'A review, feedback and thank-you for those who suggested this stunning sandalwood and subtle spice scent. I rate this handsome Brit in the same elite league as other masterpieces on my shelf such as Endymion, Lumiere Noire, Gris Clair etc. Charismatic and bright in his brief sparkling citrus and bergamot greeting. Santal is a charming guest with a soft sandal and tastefully sweet vanilla in his company your nose will linger a long time. Never cloying keeping the right amount of clove and enviable natural spice of interest in his gentlemanly sillage. Often compared to another nineties classic this creamy drydown to my nose resembles a more refined cousin to the classic Italian D&G PH and that is a true perfume compliment to both! I admire scents such as this that are both discreet in their presence but still very confident in the image they project. This is a genuine must have in any sophisticated gents wardrobe. Kind Regards, Plat ~ Score - Yes, 10/10 for my taste.', 'As the weather cools, I am wearing this more (I bought bottles of Floris Honey Oud and Floris Santal a few months ago)and I love this scent. It is a sexy, spicy fragrance that is great in cooler weather. Love the vanilla, lavender, spicy notes.', ""An absolutely superb scent that exudes warmth and masculinity. If you're looking for a classic, but not dated, men's scent this is it. It's better suited to winter like most warm, sandalwood scents, but I find it pleasant year round. It starts off very nicely with sandalwood and a touch of clove. As it develops, the cedar appears, along with lite touches of cardamom and vanilla; the dry-down is a creamy combination of vanilla and sandalwood, but remains warm and elegant without ever getting sweet or powdery. I don't get any lemon or grass from this as the notes suggest, just sandalwood all the way thru. It can easily be worn from day to nite, fitting in everywhere. It has, like most of Floris' scents, great sillage and longevity and is for mine, THE way a gentleman should smell."", ""Wow! I got this fragrance instantly and that's saying something because it goes on a distinctive journey. Opens with lavender and lemon with a soapy spice of cardamom which remains but settles back after a minute or so. Then waves of boozy coconut, nutmeg and black pepper. Then the kick of the spicy woods in the base with some olibanum in there...it's awesome! 'Sandalwood done right.'... is my opinion on this, it's just a masterful composition which clicks with me. I have to say it's instantly similar to Gucci Envy, a scent I sorely miss but Floris Santal might just be even better. It's not strong and performance is pretty average but I can live with that. It seems a little classier and more refined to my nose but I'm going off memory as I haven't smelled Envy in years now. I certainly wouldn't pay Ebay prices for a bottle these days, just get this. I'm getting this, no doubt about it."", 'A smooth, intimate sandalwood fragrance with a peper twist... I applied 6 heavy sprays o - 3 hours - 6 inch light projection with wider sillage trails. This takes 30 seconds or so to materialise but soon the sandalwood comes to the fore with a twist - I had to smell close to the skin but got a blast of very clear and well done black pepper. The sandalwood is smooth and the purist will like it 3 hours - 5 hours - 3 inch projection with wider sillage trails. This frag gets smoother as time goes on 5 hours - 6.5 hours- Close to skin.  This frag is well made.  Lovers of Creed Santal may like this if they want something a little more intimate.  Lovers of sandalwood may like this as it offers a slightly different slant with the pepper Very Unisex Not bad', ""The first time I smelled this heavenly scent, i was in the elevator with Placido Domingo who was on his way to a performance. He was sumptuously dressed in a tuxedo with diamond buttons. But, what I remember most about meeting him is how good he smelled. I couldn't resist asking him what scent he was wearing. I could not imagine what divine scent it was - what would one of the best opera singers of our time, one of the most elegantly dressed men I've ever seen wear?? It was Floris Santal. The rich sandalwood and warmth exudes elegance and fit him to a T."", 'Used to love santal extreme, but for some reason they stopped producing it But still nice fragrance', ""A lot of people like this one among sandalwood scents, but to me it's really an odd mix. Of all the sweet, vanillic sandalwoods, I recall thinking that this stuff takes the cake, going beyond the sweet concoctions of Trumpers Sandalwood and Truefitt Spanish Leather, though I'm not getting that as much this time. The opening is still reassuringly sharp, but with a very christmas-wreath sharpness and some leather underneath. There's a period in the mid notes where I find a surprisingly smooth and suave nutmeg, without its usual bite, and this fits nicely over the coniferous wreath notes. This phase is like a more refined and balanced Rocabar, with less vanilla. I thought I remembered cherry cough syrup emerging from the forest notes last time, but now I'm only getting smooth and slightly medicinal wood. Finally it hits me, though: some kind of unearthly mango or banana, the same that appears in spades in Lucky Number 6, making a sort of fruity oriental over the wood. It's much more restrained here, though, and doesn't upset the overall balance. If I didn't recognize this surprising connection, and a sudden similarity to Gucci Envy in the final base notes, I'd have just said Floris Santal is an unnaturally sweet woody oriental. Since I found those links, though, and especially the fruit component, I've warmed up to it as if I suddenly got where the scent is coming from."", 'I finally got my hands on a beautiful bottle of Floris Santal.. My interest in Floris Santal started when I was seeking a replacement for my beloved Gucci Envy.. Well my bottle came today and it is gorgeous.. Beautiful clear glass bottle with a light greenish colored juice.. Without hesitation I got ready to go out and I sprayed it on.. I immediately noticed not only is it similar to Envy but it smells amazing! From the initial blast, you can tell that this fragrance is very good quality and it has a lot going on.. It is far from just sandalwood like the name would suggest.. It is a gorgeous green cocktail of spices, woods, olibanum, and a hint of citrus.. Both Santal and Envy contain a lot of different notes, some are the same and some differ.. But overall they are very close to each other.. Envy is stronger, richer, and darker.. Envy contains alot of incense which gives it a darker feel.. Santal is like a lighter, brighter version of Envy.. The two are very very similar! Santal smells like an exotic love potion for men.. It smells sexy, but classy and sophisticated.. It has decent projection and longevity.. I feel great wearing this and I am happy I have found a great replacement for Envy!', ""I agree that Floris Santal shares some similarities with Gucci Envy for Men, however it appears to have its own distinctive personality rather than being just a copy. Santal is a smooth, spicy sandalwood fragrance. Definitely unisex, although marketed to men. Like Gucci Envy for Men, Santal is a tad sweet, with a delectable array of notes including, clove, cardamom, nutmeg, vanilla and lavender. On my female skin, the nutmeg, sandalwood, vanilla and cardamom are the most dominant accords. The drydown is surprisingly creamy, a delicate, sandalwood infused finish that wears beautifully on the skin. The sillage may not be as strong as Gucci Envy for Men, but I'm rather enjoying this lighter alternative. Seeing that Floris has named this fragrance Santal, you may be forgiven for expecting to smell a simplistic sandalwood based scent. The complexity and varying layers may come as a bit of a shock. Floris Santal is fast becoming one of my favourites from this niche brand. Oddly enough I have begun exploring Floris by testing their masculine scents first. I can happily say that I have been more than impressed. On a finishing note, the longevity is superb and the projection soft yet pleasing."", 'Floris - Santal A beautiful spicy opening with touches of grass and lemon.

It gets soft and spicy with the pepper and clove mixing in with the ingredients. I find this very refined and restrained and would make a perfect office or anytime and anywhere fragrance. It smells really nice and I love the soft spice which is the ""star accord"" within this fragrance. The only thing I wish is that the volume of the fragrance was slightly turned up as it does feel too quiet for its own good. Nice fragrance though.', 'Gucci Envy For Men anyone? A nice fresh/spicy oriental composition that\'s way too similar to the previously mentioned fragrance (except for the ginger).

I am not kidding, this is the BEST fragrance I have ever smelled. It is sweet, sophisticated, classy, gentleman-like, and just all-around pleasing to my nose. This is a gentleman‚Äôs fragrance. It is a man in all scenarios. You can wear this to the office as well as in a tuxedo. Even while sitting by the pool. There is no way this would ever offend anyone. The downside to this is it only lasts about 4-6 hours on me and it stays pretty close to my skin. For the scent profile of this is, it is an 11/10, absolutely amazing. I just wish it would stick around for the whole day.  Either way, I think this is a full bottle worthy purchase. Get your nose on this, it's absolutely divine.

But this morning after shaving and bathing I used Floris\' Santal after shave, followed a few minutes later with 3 sprays of the EdT, and it has been one delightful morning. The sandalwood isn\'t front and centre with this one, but it is rather a thin veil over each and every one of the other notes. This gives it a quite rare ethereal quality that I\'ve found in few other fragrances, most notably in Penhaligon\'s Endymion cologne. Santal doesn\'t smell ""like"" Endymion, but the two have a similar almost angelic quality with which I am quite taken. And as Thomas Aquinas tells us, each angel is a species unto itself. Such a desirable scent. In typical Floris fashion, it is ever so discreet. Many confuse Floris\' discretion with a lack of performance. I don\'t think that\'s the case. The fragrance is there, but it becomes a part of me, and not something that either precedes or follows me. I appreciate that. And in any case, if I feel like I can\'t smell it there\'s still more in the bottle!', 'I purchased this a few years ago due to its similarity to Gucci envy, and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Lovely fragrance. However I purchased a 2021 batch at Christmas and i have to say the performance is inexcusable. It disappears within minutes, even after 5 or 6 sprays. For a niche brand like this it‚Äôs shocking. I returned it. A great fragrance ruined entirely due to its lack of staying power. I hope they fix this', 'Eau de Santal is a bright, spicy sandalwood fragrance, with some sweet, powdery, and aromatic touches. Good for a professional setting. Not quite strong enough for the depths of winter.', 'On my skin, it lasts for a few minutes and then I cannot smell it. What I smell is great, and I love the cardamom. Unfortunately, even with 6-8 sprays, it doesn‚Äôt last. It will be a bed time scent.', 'This one failed the nose-wrinkle test: if my first impression of any fragrance is that involuntary reaction, I form an immediate dislike to it.  Eau de Santal begins with a blast of artificial spicy notes and seems just like any other Woody/Spicy fragrance you ever tested.  It settles down after a while into an unthreatening, low-key clovey musk ... but that nose-wrinkling effect is never far away for me.', ""Save for the minor short opening of citrus and cardamom, nothing else reminds me of Envy here. Its like a sweeter and thicker version of Endymion and not in a good way. The Penhaligon's transparent and airy qualities make it the overall better choice for me over this sticky Floris.""]"

This one walks the same synthetic love it/hate it line as Individuel. I get Plum, Cardamom, Vanilla, Rum, and Musk. None of these notes smells close to natural. It's definitely not a summer fragrance, and since I live where we rarely get any days cold enough to wear this, it will likely end up being my next bathroom/bedroom spray. 11/24 Update: I've realized that Lacoste shouldn't get a pass because they came out with something this unpleasant, especially since they've done so many other fragrances so well. I can still remember how much I loved Lacoste Red (Style in Play) that came out a few years later, and L.12.12 Blanc. I just sprayed Pour Homme today and it's just not even close to that level.

Yeah lots of plum, very bright, synthetic, too sweet in the heat. I'd really like to try this in the winter, and I will. But as for summer, three sprays is too much.

I think Lacoste is a house for guys in their teens/twenties. Edit: Three days later and I'm thinking about this fragrance. It's memorable for sure, I'm definitely gonna try this again. I did like the smell."", ""After having this bottle for over 10 years and starting a collection of fragrances in the last 3 years I can‚Äôt believe how much I still like this scent. Being a cheapy I would have expected this to become less of a compelling scent after trying so many other fragrances but this one just has such a unique profile and works for so many occasions it‚Äôs hard to ignore. It is also my wife‚Äôs favorite when I wear it. Even though it has fruit I still wouldn‚Äôt call it fruity but has the right mix to be a great everyday office/work scent. Has some sweetness to it but is balanced enough it‚Äôs not overly sweet. The plum is dominant note in opening but it‚Äôs kept tame by the sour of the grapefruit and green apple. Then juniper and cardamom play off each other to create a nice landing of musky woods and a touch of rum and vanilla in the dry down. I don't get much cinnamon. My bottle is older than dirt so my review is not based off of current formula. The notes listed make it sound heavy but it‚Äôs far from it. I guess for Lacoste it is heavier than other offerings. Only fragrances I have tried that are in same vein are Gucci Made to Measure & Mont Blanc Individual if it lost its raspberry note. Longevity and silage is average at best but being a work scent I don‚Äôt mind. Body heat tends to bring it back alittle. It‚Äôs not strong enough for winter but all other months of years it‚Äôs a great daytime fragrance that is hard to dislike for anyone. Not profound but great rounded fragrance. 8/10"", ""Awesome everyday scent. This is good signature attempt. But the longevity is not good at all. Two hours with four sprays. But it's so good, fruity and musky. From my time wearing it (right now it's week or so) the dry down is more unisex but still masculine enough to wear this while being son of greek god and norse warrior."", ""Great everyday cologne for any occasion. I love this stuff. It is fresh, but at the same time balanced. I cannot think of an occasion or season. that this would be inappropriate to wear. I'd even go so far as to say that this is my new signature scent!"", ""4 Dec 2022 - First Impression I blind buy this and it have positive review on most of youtuber review and I would  like to have something from House of Lacoste as my first fragrance I ordered online many years back (It was LACOSTE Booster and LACOSTE Essential). Wow, this is nice. Open with plum note Which is dominant, very sweet and tasty. Apple and citruses barely presents in the top note. Lead to Warm spicy most dominant by Cardamom very The One by D&G. Cinnamon aspect presented lightly under Cardamom. Peppery is very low, juniper is not their.This linger quite long. Around 3 hours Base is vanilla with rum which is amplified overall tone of this fragrance to be more loud, and mild boozy (not overwhelming) but creamy and smooth as well, I think Rum in base kinda enhance the plum to be dominant in top when rum is run out it just powder and musk (the vanilla in this feels higher quality side). Overall life is around 5-6 hours Most project 2-3 hours which is not bad considering this is EDT. I feel like this is fragrance that better in Air than up-close. Very difference from house of Lacoste which normally make Green/Freshie, This is very Warm and Strong would, not really Grey fragrance but more like Brown. (Aramani Code Profumo, D&G The One, Azzaro Wanted by Night) If someone say this is house of Burberry, I would believe  (Very similar tone layering to Burberry Brit for Him) Quite similar to The One by D&G (but going in Fruity direction)  a bit fresher / lighter and no tobacco. Consider this is 30 bucks, it is good for cheapie fragrance. Kinda synthetic but it ok. Scent profile fits mostly for night as it leans sweet, cozy and boozy. Can be formal if you are not center of event. Can be fun night out fragrance for corporate event but spicy aspect might be too much. It‚Äôs kinda have formal tone to it but it doesn‚Äôt feel very premium (but consider this is cheapie, it is smell better than the price) If don‚Äôt mild spicy profile this could fit your bill. As scent - 7/10 As cheapie - 8/10 ===== 1st Wear I give this a nice full wear and yes, it is a scent that better in the air than direct smell. It seems to be classier side but still have fun. Young. Carefree. undertone. it's also have that mild sporty undertone to it age group would be 25-30 yo. and it can be wear both day and night but I would reserve this for evening - night. As it still have that mild boozy feel to it. The projection is good around 2 hours before it comes closer to skin. The full life of this fragrance is around 6 hours then it disappears without a trace of skin scent (like it all gone) and it is only downfall. Final score Solid 7/10 Personal rating 6/10 Suggestion : I think this make good cheapie to throw in the car and use as back up fragrance as refreshment before night out. Would I repurchase - No - I found out I doesn't like boozy fragrance. It's smell too fun for me."", ""I've had this one for over a year now. I don't reach for it that often, but it really is a nice fragrance. I like the way it has so many notes that could possibly be hard to describe without seeing a note list. I would have never said plum for example, but after seeing that note listed I can imagine that may be one note, but not sure if it's the power of suggestion.  I like the unique balance to this. Its sweetness is just right, not syrupy or heavy-fruity, or heavy at all. It's fresh, but not a freshie. It has a powdery aspect, but I wouldn't categorize it as a powder fragrance. I get some woods, but wouldn't put in in a wood category. It's just different. One of the Lacoste fragrances that I really enjoy, a house that deserves a little more credit than it sometimes gets.  I also think it has pretty good performance and projection, but not great. Better than some others have unfortunately experienced. I would also say it's better for cool weather, but can see it good for any season as a work/indoor fragrance."", ""I don't understand why this perfume is not more popular, very good smell. It has similarities with Hugo Boss Bottled EDT, but this one has a plum note that gives it a different touch. Very wearable and comfortable, in my opinion, for all seasons, except for summer, I wouldn't wear it when it's hot."", 'I absolutely love the plum note that dominates the opening and mid of this fragrance.

Solid performance as well and for a cheapie.  Aces.', ""The Firas Mohammad review in this thread is well said, comprehensive & accurate. Compliments dial in on the warmth & vanilla, it smells like a 3x - 4x above what it cost and distinguishes you from the blue frag & aventus clone crowd. This has replaced Mont Blanc Starwalker in my rotation as it's less common, and a notch better in my opinion."", ""Really really dislike this scent. Might even be close to a hate for me if it weren't for the fact that after about 30min it smells more manageable. The plum note in this fragrance is straight up nasty but thankfully it fades away somewhat after that 30min mark or so. If they took that disgusting plum note out altogether, this would be a very lovely scent profile. But all I get within the first half hour is plum, plum, and more nasty plum. Once it is gone however, you are left with a somewhat decent soft spicy feel which isn't too bad. I'm selling my 95% full bottle on this one because I have tried on 3 different occasions to give it a chance and I just don't like it. I give it a 5/10."", ""I love this scent! I think it's the pink pepper and rum that really get me. I'm surprised that people suggest that this is not a summer fragrance - to me it's nicely fresh and better suited to the warmer months. Awful performance for me though. Barely get half an hour and I can no longer smell it on clothes or skin."", 'This fragrance flys under the radar, and is probably the best release from this house. It‚Äôs one of the best cheapies you could find!', ""After a lot of use of the perfume, I found that plum and green apple are the most prominent notes when starting to spray the perfume.After the opening phase ends, cinnamon and cardamom enter, but the cinnamon here is not rough, noisy or suffocating, but rather warm and agreeable, and gives a slight spicy touch to the fragrance. In the end, the vanilla is characterized by its creamy character with a note I could not recognize, and touches of sandalwood. The fragrance is fruity with a little sweetness, a bit of warmth due to cinnamon and cardamom, and also creamy as a result of vanilla and sandal, it smells nice, classy, elegant, comfortable, semi-fresh and uncomplicated, completely safe, easy to wear, does not bother anyone, a fragrance that smells good and gets the job done . It is not one of the fragrances of excitement and temptation, nor of power, nor control and influence, nor perfume of recovery and gyms, but it is a general perfume, for multiple use, day and night, very ideal for the office, or college and even high school, and for all ages. Lacoste pour homme perfume can be bought without trying, as well as wearing it without thinking, wherever you want to go, and in all seasons of the year, especially spring and autumn, and it will not let you down. The longevity of the perfume on the body is from 6 to 8 hours, with a medium sillage and projection , and an affordable price, and according to my opinion, it is the best men's perfume from Lacoste, it is the hidden gem.

Nowadays, I like it more as an office scent. But for people who like to be active. It's generic in the way montblanc scents are, but at the same time not overpowering so quite versatile. At its price point, definitely value for money. I think this and Lacoste black are the best."", 'Over the years, this remains my ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù fragrance for any occasion, anytime of the year.

Sort of clean in a fruit way. I laugh when people talk about other people stating that the performance is awful. It is awful. This is a do-nothing fragrance..because it does nothing. It is linear, when its dry it is gone unless it is on cloth and then you have to press nostrils on it to pick it up.  This is typical of Lacoste. The brand creates scents that smell kind of good but have no performance. I don't know if its a strategy to keep customers applying the frag all day long therefore going through extreme amounts and thus buying more.. but lacoste certainly doesn't apply anything into giving their releases any longevity. My dog has farts that last longer.  What I use this for: I keep it in the bathroom and spray it on the towels and that helps keep the room smelling fresh and when we use a towel it smells nice. That is it. It is a towel freshener. I won't even give it a rating. It is almost as bad as Zihr Courderoy. lacoste is nothing but a low budget / gym fragrance brand. So yeah, I am a brand snob. There... I said it."", 'Lacoste Pour Homme is one of my favorites. This has a unique smell, opens fruity with a warm spicy undertone.

Thumbs down for this one.', ""Found it at a discounters, so I thought I would give it a shot. The opening is a bit offensive due to how synthetic it smelled at first. Its a bit overwhelming. Initially, you get the great fresh smell of the top notes, but I would get whiffs of something artificial or synthetic. The plum, cinnamon and pepper is mostly what I smelled in the mid, but the dry down gets much sweeter. Vanilla was definitely the strongest base note, but there was also a decent amount of rum and musk to my nose. Its nothing mind blowing, but nothing offensive either. Its probably a safe choice for something like school or the office, especially during spring or fall. You might be able to wear this for summer if you're indoors. In no way does this smell bad, but I don't think you'd really get compliments for this one. I honestly rather use this as an air freshener for my room than actually wear it. 6.5/10.

In the opening you get bold plum along with faint citrus and some spices (a mildly fresh clean spiciness), the spiciness actually blends well with the sweeter notes as it makes the plum and apple notes not overly sweet (giving LPH masculinity).  LPH has a fresh cleanliness to it (from the musk, juniper & citrus) that supports its spicy notes (pink pepper cardamom and cinnamon) very well through the mid, the spiciness also gets slightly warm, as the plum sweetness remains, added with some slight creaminess (vanillas &/or sandlewood) and booziness (from the rum). To me, the mid is actually the best part of the fragrance because once it completely dries all the main notes which makes the fragrance good fade and you're mainly left with mild clean-musk and faint spicy/sweetness.

I'm just not a fan of warm spice colognes - personal preference I guess.

Great presentation with a great sweet plum and a very nice mature booze quality.. this stuff is amazing  Rating  9/10', 'Lacoste Pour Homme Men EDT opens with a moderate projection of sweet, citrus, fruity, spicy, and woody notes. The opening is delectable, fresh, mild, and pleasant. The bergamot and plum are the most noticeable opening fruity accords, particularly the plum, which makes the fragrance feel ‚Äútasty‚Äù. The bergamot accentuates the fruity note by adding a slight but noticeable sour and sharp touch. The fragrance has a noticeable aromatic sweetness which is the vanilla, and although is listed as a base note, it comes up as soon as the fragrance is applied. The grapefruit and apple are the least noticeable opening notes, just a whiff but there. As time passes, the bergamot subsides and the vanilla takes the lead; at this point, the sweet-spicy cinnamon and pink pepper become noticeable and follow closely the lead of the vanilla. Along with the spicy notes, there is a boozy touch that becomes more noticeable as the fragrance dries down, the combination of the vanilla and rum create a pleasant accord. The rest of the notes are there to provide support, some projection, and woody. The fragrance has a noticeable opening to dry-down change, the opening favors the citrus and fruity notes, these notes are sharp; but as they dry-down, they take one step back and the vanilla, rum, cinnamon, and pink pepper become noticeable. Additionally, the initial moderate projection lowers to soft. Once Lacoste Pour Homme Men EDT has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a soft projection, sweet (vanilla), boozy (rum), spicy (cinnamon, pink pepper) and fruity (plum) fragrance with woody, and citrus accords. The fragrance feels boozy, casual, cozy, delectable, diluted, energizing, faint, fresh, fruity, inviting, masculine, modern, moderate-quality, playful, short-lived, slightly sour, spicy, sweet, versatile, woody, and pleasant.

Moderate to low, about 2 feet behind the wearer. APPLICATION: 8 atomizations. Apply generously to improve performance. LONGEVITY: 4/10. Moderate, about 4 hours, but it projects only for 1 hour. SEASONS: Winter, spring, fall, colder days, and climate-controlled environments. OCCASIONS: Formal events, outdoor gatherings, office, casual, holidays, vacations, romantic, dating. This is an office-friendly fragrance.  VERSATILITY: 7/10. Very good, a softly sweet, boozy, fruity fragrance, ideal almost for any occasion. GENDER: Masculine, the spicy notes create a slight tilt to the masculine side. AGES: Any. RECOMMENDATION: Lacoste Pour Homme Men EDT can be purchased for about $20, it is an affordable and great scent but, as it happens with most of the fragrances of this house, it is very soft and short-lived. If you don‚Äôt mind reapplying frequently and generously, this is a good nice-to-have. BLIND-BUY: Yes, but only if you are familiar with its main notes. SIMILAR: These are examples of fragrances in the same genre. Carolina Herrera CH Prive EDT has fruity, whiskey, and leathery accords, a good scent; Carolina Herrera 212 VIP features vodka, ginger, fruits, leather, and woody accords; Thierry Mugler Angel Men Pure Malt is a fantastic one, with whiskey, coffee, vanilla, and fruity accords; Bvlgari Man in Black features boozy, leather, tobacco, and spicy accords, a great scent; Azzaro Pour Homme Intense EDP is another superb brandy, vetiver, and tonka fragrance; Nasomatto Baraonda is a fantastic slightly sweet, strong boozy (whiskey) fragrance with woody notes; Hugo Boss The Scent Absolute EDP features woody, ginger, and rum notes; Lacoste Pour Homme Men EDT is good but very soft, sweet vanilla, rum, cinnamon, pink pepper, and plum fragrance. SUMMARY: A soft projection, sweet (vanilla), boozy (rum), spicy (cinnamon, pink pepper) and fruity (plum) fragrance with woody, and citrus accords. The fragrance feels boozy, casual, cozy, delectable, diluted, energizing, faint, fresh, fruity, inviting, masculine, modern, moderate-quality, playful, short-lived, slightly sour, spicy, sweet, versatile, woody, and pleasant.', 'At first I wasnt a fan of this scent but after wearing this on a cold morning I actually enjoyed it. Im going to save this for the colder days.', 'As a female, I do not shy away from unisex and/or ""men\'s"" fragrances. This, to me, is not super masculine at all. It is this fruity, sweet (sweet in a natural way) and slightly spicy fragrance due to the cinnamon. This is a perfect day to day fragrance for both genders.', ""I don't like this. Right away I noticed the cinnamon note and it's all I smell. It isn't too cloying but it does bother me because I genuinely don't want my bf to smell like cinnamon. It also smells pretty old school."", ""There is something about this scent that leads my mind to a locker room at indoor swimming - could sound off putting, but I mean it in the best ways. I guess it's the sporty, steamy quality that reminds me of it. Or maybe it's because someone actually sprayed it once in a locker room I was in. It's a solid, masculine raw fruity scent. A winner in my book."", 'It\'s nice, pleasant, fresh & fruity. Reminiscent to me of Guy Laroche\'s Horizon. It\'s offensive and a good grab and go fragrance. It is not, and I don\'t think it\'s intended to be, a ""Wow"" what a fragrance type, and it doesn\'t have to be. A good, clean, fresh, Spring fragrance that is cheap enough to just have.', 'Great versatile cheapie with beautiful plum note. Even though I am not a big fan of vanilla note in fragrances it is my favorite Lacoste for sure. Longevity - moderate ~6 hours. Definitely worth a try.', 'This cologne smells GREAT. The closest thing I can think of that smells similar is Black Ice air freshener. So if you like how Black Ice smells, you will like this.', 'One of the best office fragrances in the market. Beautiful smell, non ofensive and with nice longevity and projection. And its cheap.If you want to please almost everyone in your work with a nice scent, this is a safe choice. Summer and spring only.', ""Bringin' back sweet memories... This is an oldie but greatie. Had this years back pulled the trigger again and this competes with some higher end designer/niche fragrances that I have. Unique, clean, fun and office friendly.  8/10"", ""This frag made me very sad. I guess my nose can't pick it up but after many YouTube reviews, and decent reviews on here I was excited to find this at Marshall's only to unbox it and the scent was so faint I barely could enjoy it.  Nothing smelled bad, just couldn't smell it. Maybe an expired bottle if that's a thing or a bad batch? Returned it no problem thankfully."", ""I had to check the name on the bottle after sniffing this from my skin such is the sweet and somewhat heavy character of the scent. I always expect Lacoste fragrances to be pretty light with a lot of citrus and floral notes, warm weather fare.  This is something altogether different and makes me think of more cold weather scents, many have mentioned Boss Bottled and although I don't really get that it could be like a cross between that and something like Bentley for Men (Intense, as that's the only I know), the booze and leathery vibe is what does it. Another one that comes to mind Le Male Essence de Parfum but I guess LPH is really it's own beast. Not for me but unlike the reviewer below I got extremely good performance on my skin (from a store tester), maybe it helps that the weather has (finally) cooled down a bit."", 'Dont buy recent batches. Last only 2hrs then skin scent 1hr. I just bought it due to positive reviews. On the opening its plum & spicy 30 mins & its nice. After that its a Boss bottled vibe, beautiful. Then it takes a different path, nice a bit leathery with dried fruit but only about 1hr, then its gone. Even on clothes 3hrs then gone. I sprayed twice on 5 points... its gone 3 hrs. I you want the mid scent, buy boss bottled 6-8 hrs lasting. Im done with Lacoste, it comes at the same level of Guess or cheap celebrity fragances. I never had a fragrance disappear on clothes after 3hrs. Dont buy recent batches. WTF I had better & cheaper.', ""My signature scent in high school (2005-2006). Will update this review after getting my hands on a bottle for a second impression now that I'm 30 years old and it's been 12-13 years since I've worn it."", 'Yummy. Cozy, delicious fragrance with a kick. I normally do not like sweet scents, but the plum, apple, vanilla combination is striking in this one and makes it therefore a special blend. Its comforting, relaxing and sexy. Signature material here.', 'A plum pepper bomb that reminds me of a fruitier version of Ferragamo F Black... seriously. This seems to me as a solid fruity peppery spring-time fragrance. Very safe, and good for the office. I plan to wear this to the office next week and I‚Äôm looking forward to it! For the price this can be obtained for, a great deal!', 'for $25-30 .. probably one of the best out there. a compliment getter.classy smell.well worth a blind buy. 8.5/10  *Midnight in Paris - 5.5/10*', 'A Plum Bomb on Lacoste Pour Homme SOTD: Lacoste Pour Homme: As of 01/11/19 Right of the bat my nose detect pretty much of the plum, vanilla on the opening and then a hint of rum start to creep in, as the dry down kicks in I scent the apple, cinnamon, bergamot, pepper and grapefruit, one post reviewer said he detects a freshness vibe with the scent I detect to as well. To me is a sweet and fresh scent which is nice, this is the 2nd Lacoste fragrance that I owned the very first one is the Style in Play. I liked the plum on this fragrance with Vanilla mixed in is pleasing and not cloying. Is a nice release from Lacoste it would be nice if this was a EDP instead of a EDT, and is a must have. Rating Scent: 8/10 Presentation/Design: 6.5/10 Value: 7/10 Longevity/Performance: 7.5/10: Lasted on skin/skin scent between 6-8+ hrs Overall: 7.25/10 My SOTD/OSOTD (Scent of the Day/Office Scent of the Day): Lacoste Pour Homme EDT: As of 03/08/19 My 2nd wearing of this fragrance became my OSOTD or Office Scent of the Day as of 03/08/19, Plum is beginning to be one of my favorite notes in fragrance especially the combo of plum and vanilla which are a good combo if it is done well or blended well together. On this fragrance both plum and vanilla are well blended and it stands out. I get the hint of the fruity and rum vibe in the background which is there to my nose. But again the Plum, Vanilla and Rum are the main players here on this fragrance, to me the Rum is buried on the background with the Vanilla and Plum and again the Rum is there. My overall rating on this fragrance I will give this fragrance some love due to the Plum and Vanilla combo I will rate it 8 out of 10, and the longevity/performance it will be 8.25 out of 10, I went a have dose on the sprays around 9-11, lasted on my skin as a skin scent around 9-11+ hrs which is semi-beast mode. Again is a must have if you love the combo of Plum and Vanilla with rum. Is a superb fragrance with a cheap/bargain of a price.', ""I am still undecided on this one... Sometimes this stuff turns powdery to my nose which I hate. I hate powdery frags more than anything.  Sometimes it becomes a soft, sandalwood/cedar/vanilla.  It's definitely not an extremely spicy frag. It's very laid back and cold in nature. I think it's nice, but I am still unsure."", 'When i first get this fragrance i was underwhelmed.. its nothing special.. but after a few more wearing, i started to like it much more.. i do get the plum n some other freshness in the beginning.. after 10 to 15 minutes the freshness fades away but the plum stays with a pepperry and vanillic background. I dont really get the rum note.. no rum like man in black by bvlgari.. so if you thinking of purchasing this for the rum note i suggest look elsewhere.. but if you looking to enjoy the plum sweetness and a tinged of tard sour smell with the smooth vanilla background then this is a good option.. suitable for modern man age 25+', 'I find this one excellent, especially after about an hour or two. The opening had a good spice to it (not peppery).. and I find myself reaching for this in the fall/winter months. I‚Äôd rather spray Lacoste white if I were to stay in the same house during spring/summer. Just my 2. Longevity is great.. projection is great.. dry down is really great. It smooths out into a vanilla scent on my skin that‚Äôs super creamy. Cuts through the cold weather, and it‚Äôs not a compliment monster, it‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúwarm‚Äù feeling frag imo. Good all around er. Overall a great warm, spicey, sweet, semi fresh scent.. that could work in many different settings. Age group would be college and up, maybe high school but it‚Äôs a little spicey for a teenager I‚Äôd think. Then again I wore Perry Ellis 360 green in high school and choked out half my class. Bottom line.. great juice.', 'Love...Love...Love me some Lacoste pour homme!!', 'Well well well, what a wonderful aroma this has with the plum note taking the front seat. A lovely blend of woods and fruit that for the price is fantastic! Easy blind buy, hard not to like!! 8/10', 'You don\'t find plum in too many men\'s fragrances. In Lacoste Pour Homme it is done reasonably well. This is a dumb reach type of a fragrance for the warmer months, but I particularly like it for the Spring.  Upon the first spray, I mostly get a huge grapefruit note. It is so big and juicy that it drowns out most everything else. That lasts for about 5 to 10 minutes and then I get the plum. It is a nice fruity nuance without being too sweet. The spices are there like the cardamom and pink pepper, but the fruits are the major players. At the complete dry down, it smells like most other mass appealing fragrances with vanilla, sandalwood, and cedar. I do not pick up the rum note at all. I would say this is pretty generic, but it is a ""generic"" fragrance done right. As with many citrus fresh fragrances, it only lasts on the skin for about 5 to 6 hours, if that, and only projects for about half of those hours.  I give this a 6.5/10. I really like it and am glad to have it in my collection. I use it frequently in the Spring, but also sometimes in the Fall and Winter (the high Summer heat would probably turn this sour). It reminds me of the kind of image that Lacoste is going for; clean crisp polos at the country club, straight-laced attitude, sipping on a half-and-half (Arnold Palmer), shooting the sh*t with some buddies. There are better freshies out there, but for an office or casual fragrance, you can\'t go wrong.', 'If you are like me and citrus/bergamot frags quickly turn sour on your skin then you understand how difficult it is to find a ""summer"" spray and go. There aren\'t many choices left besides the lavender--my grandma wore this, the soapy cheap, shower gel frags that disappear after 2 hrs, or the super popular Sauvage that everyone and their brother is wearing. I admit, I\'ve spent far too much $ lately trying to find an alternative.  I believe I have found it with Lacoste Pour Homme. Although there is some citrus in the opening, it quickly gives way to the green apple and plum. The fruit dominance lasts for about 30-45 minutes. After that, the cardamom and warmth comes up just enough to soften the sweet fruit. A bit synthetic at skin level, but the moderate sillage comes across as more sophisticated and well blended. Longevity is 6-7 hours. An honest 6-7.  You aren\'t going to knock someone out with this but it\'s apple and plum freshness make it a great summer choice. Definitely shoots above it\'s price.', 'This sexy fragrance is under the radar and is very unique,the plum note is very smooth,at first I gave this scent a 8 out of 10 but after receiving so many compliments and getting 7 plus hours each wear I have to give this a 10 out of 10,u can find this easily online for 25 bucks or less,its probably the best cheapy but goodie u will ever purchase.......peace', 'This is one of the first ""name brand"" fragrances I purchased and was one that made me see how much better higher quality fragrances can be over my typical Avon scents. Now looking back, it isn\'t a high-quality scent compared to high-end designers and niche stuff, but that does not mean it\'s a bad scent at all. It is actually quite amazing for its price. Sweet vanilla and plum with rum. Slightly spicy due to the cinnamon and cardamon which adds depth to the rum note. The sandalwood and vanillagives it a creamy vibe, but not gourmand. It is a classy fragrance that is simple, but simple does not mean boring. It can be dressed up or down. It probably works best in the spring, but you could do a late fall/winter with it as well since the plum and rum are very noticeable. Would be good for a date night fragrance year round. Scent 8/10 (simple, yet versatile) Sillage 6/10 (about arm length, but this is not aloud scent and it not made to be a sillage beast) Longevity 7/10 (I can get 6-7 hours out of it) Value 8/10 (you can get this for around 25-30 USD at discounters and that is a great value for something this versatile and long-lasting.) Presentation 7/10 (The bottle is nice and heavy. It looks refined, but simple.I almost want to say it had a magnetic cap, but I lost it and can\'t recall) Overall, a decent blind buy if you are looking for a simple versatile scent that is inoffensive and will get you compliments. If you don\'t like rum notes, stay away. Probably best for 25+.', ""I felt like I knew how it would smell before it arrived. A bit disappointed, but I should know by now! It smells nice, but not what I imagined. Not sure if this makes sense, but it's like the smell is fuzzy or fractured, like a mixed bag of sweets. I imagined a clean, sharp plum note. Describing smells is hard isn't it! Anyway, my expectations are neither here nor there. It's a nice scent. Sweet and fruity and ideal for a bracing winter walk in the city. Very good value and should be owned by all professional child catchers and pied piper types."", 'Good scent! reminds me a lot of Hugo Boss Bottled.', 'God I hate this fragrance, gives me a headache.', ""I agree with Zuma_Moon in that this fragrance is underrated. It is a great scent that is extremely versatile, IMO. It can be dressed up or down in any season, day or night (although wouldn't work as a clubbing scent). I find it fresh and classy. Hard to offend anyone while wearing this. I believe this utilitarian aspect is what hurts it. It is not ground breaking or earth shattering. It is a workhorse of a fragrance that smells nice and gets the job done....and I'm OK with that."", 'Really pleasant and sweet vanillafragrance. I think it¬¥s kind of ""mature"", best for 30+ I guess. Good longevity and sillage. Safe blindbuy', 'I feel this scent does not get mentioned enough on here, its criminally underrated imo. I always have this close to hand in my cabinet as its an easy non offensive classy smelling scent. Ideally an Autumn/Winter scent but can be worn all year no problems, suitable for any age too. Opens with a lovely citrus and plum blast, then progresses into a warm spicy vanilla scent which lasts around 6 hours with 6-8 generous sprays. Great quality scent for the price and definitely a people pleaser.... 8/10', ""SWEET - PLUM + APPLE - VANILLA - RUM This is probably the sweetest fragrance I have in my collection, maybe even sweeter than the lovely Cuba Prestige cigar I have lying around somewhere. Because of it's sweetness, it leans more towards Fall & Winter wear. But the drydown turns this into an understated vanilla+rum base that could work in daytime settings like work. Just make sure you get past the initial blast before judging it. The initial hit is a strong, in-your-face, alcoholic/synthetic opening that is VERY SWEET. Wait until it dries down and then you can enjoy it. Whatever you do, don't spray this on yourself and then immediately present yourself to people - you won't get the reactions you want. Spray yourself at least 15 to 20 minutes before going out and you'll be fine."", ""This is a clean and soft plum fragrance. I smell Plum with touches of Vanilla and Rum. The base has some sandalwood but its very underneath everything else. Its an ok fragrance. It's unique for that plum note but nothing great for me. 6/10"", 'one of the best fragrence ever', 'recently buy this juice. in my personal opinion LPH (batch 2015) is combination from versace pour homme mix with hugo boss energise. fresh, sweet, very safe and versatile.', 'It\'s like Boss Bottled with less citrus and added booze notes. The plum is nice and the vanilla is solid. Arm\'s length projection and good longevity (10+ hours.) There are few fragrances under $40USD that give you this much performance and depth. One of those ""dumb reach"" fragrances that I think everyone should have.', ""I'm not a big fan of Lacoste frag's,but this one is realy nice... simple,but elegant and sofisticated,very pleasant, longevity is 7h+ and projection on medium side.."", 'Has it ever happened to you that you do not find that fragrance put on for reasons of ... Climate, occasion, or mood? This fragrance solves that aromatic dilemma. I do not know why I associate the fragrances of Lacoste in the same line of Nautica, Guess or Diesel and No with other designer houses like Versace or Chanel to put an example. The bottle is simple but ... Incredibly beautiful and elegant. To me; it looks like Chanel\'s Allure pour Homme, only at the beginning (not everyone likes this similarity) and it is not less true the resemblance to Dior Homme Eau, especially in the final drying and certain vibe to F Ferragamo Black Maybe for the pepper and the apple that both share. What most perceives my pseudose nose is a pleasant smell like ""vanilla powdery"", a little of the ""spicy"" of cinnamon and actually quite sweet, but not the cloying, only to notice that it can be very penetrating to the nostrils and Intrusive sometimes, it happened to me. Lacoste pour Homme is not a pompous fragrance or ""all star"", does not pretend to be what it is not, it is not hidden behind a brand to sell, rather it is a ""UTILITY"" perfume ... of those that we apply when we are about to leave in a hurry and have the time over. This alligator is quite versatile, for the office or the gym, formal and informal, at any time of day or season of the year, even age range. My bottle is 2013, with good projection and nuclear longevity. Not that I love it, but I can not deny the good quality of this ""silver crocodile"".', ""I love this stuff. The more I use it, the more I appreciate its versatility. It goes well anywhere--not overpowering, yet it has terrific staying power and becomes a gorgeous skin scent as it concludes. This is my go-to, every-day spray. Don't let the name deter you from considering this fantastic offering from Lacoste. LPH's opening could be characterized as being somewhat synthetic--though not in a bad way. Then, as LPH begins to settle-in, it presents a powdery, peppered plum persona--emphasis on the plumb--that lingers on the skin for a nice long time. It's not entirely complex, but it is very nicely balanced. It's a safe scent that can be worn ANY time without worries. I absolutely recommend this little beauty."", 'Classy! I like this one a lot! The smell reminds me of a lighter version of Mont Blanc Individuel. They would be interchangeable imo.', ""So good,that plum note makes this cologne unique. It's great for spring rotation day and night. Longevity is ok. Skin scent after 2-3 hours. This is a sexy one"", ""Very versatile.. I literally couldn't put this to a particular time of year or day. Fantastic performance. Lasts all day, and projects for hours! Another one that people just dismiss.. when in actual fact it's a real gem!!"", ""So originally I dismissed this scent as this has a semi-harsh opening and is very synthetic. But this is a scent you have to give at least 2 wearings before you judge whether or not you like it.  Admittedly my opinion changed on this because of the compliments I received ! I put this on in the morning for the first time and liked it but didn't think it was special but then 5 hours later I received a compliment at work and then when I got home my girlfriend buried her face in my chest and said this might be one of her new favorites. She however didn't care for this when I sprayed it in the morning. This starts off with a fresh but zingy opening that's slightly synthetic but not completely off putting but still not entirely pleasant. Once this dries down though you get a very soft,vanilla scent that's masculine and also has a fresh edge to it as well. To my nose this smells like a fresh vanilla scented dryer sheet. The drydown to this is very addicting and pleasant and has a great balance of being fresh and sweet without being sickly sweet. My girlfriend said it's very comforting but also very attractive as well and reminded her of boss bottled but she likes this better. Performance on this is great ! It lasts 8-12 hours and projects very well. I thought it was below average but I've been complimented when I thought it disappeared which makes me believe your nose becomes nose blind to this pretty easily.  (Also 2-3 sprays is all you need and less is more with this scent) Overall rating --- 8 out of 10 ! Great scent for a great price that smells great and lasts all day"", 'I blind bought this for my spring rotation but after a smelling it I decided it would be perfect for the winter. Besides, in the spring I much prefer fragrances with green notes, fresh vetiver, grassy and earthy scents like TDH. Lacoste PH does not fit my spring preference, nor does it fit my fall and summer fragrances, so I put it in my winter rotation and it\'s perfect, mainly because of the gorgeous vanilla. The plum note in this is very well done, and gives me hints of the approaching warm weather. For some reason I detect a honey in this, but I don\'t see it listed in the notes? But again, I\'ve never been one to detect notes that well. One of my favorite things about this fragrance is it\'s fairly unique. My collection is about 130 bottles and not one of them smells like this one. If there\'s one thing I hate is when I blind buy a fragrance only to find out it smells too close to one I already have. Lacoste Pour Homme has it\'s own character for sure. It\'s a nice break from the more traditional winter fragrances such as Polo Green, Quorom, Dior Homme, Interlude Man and other smokey, oud, leather, woodsy, sweet colognes I enjoy wearing in the cold days of winter. I rate Lacoste a 8/10 because it\'s a very nice scent, unique, versatile, and very affordable. Absolutely blind buy worthy. Enjoy! :) Update 1/16/18 - Yesterday I wore 3 sprays of Lacoste Pour Homme (2 on chest and 1 behind neck) and I got compliments all day. First on the train, a young lady asked me what cologne I was wearing. During lunch a guy said to me ""my wife would love that fragrance you are on what is it."" Later in the day at the office my secretary said I smelled amazing. In the evening I went to the gym and although I couldn\'t smell the fragrance anymore, a gym member said to me ""that cologne smells so good."" I don\'t think I ever got 3 compliments in one day on a fragrance. So I guess the rumors are true, people really like this fragrance, particularly the ladies, More so than I originally thought.', '8/10 nice scent I get like 6 to 7 hrs with it.', ""This scent... Is very clean: I can smell the granny smith apple mixed with, what I can say...liquid soap scent. With a hint of rum, which you can't really pick up. Unless you knew it was there, unless you looked up the notes listed on the site. It's a very safe scent to wear. But seems like something I would wear as a teenager to early years of college. Sillage about a foot away tops(unless you overdo it). Last about four to six hours at best. I'd wear this to the gym, market, etc. This won't impress anyone. But you'll smell like a fabric softener sheet. Overall...Would I buy this again? No. I bought a 3.3 oz bottle for $28.76, and I feel jip (robbed or letdown)."", 'I had this for about 2-3 weeks and found it too sharp for my taste. I\'m a nut for sweet, fruity scents, but unfortunately I did not find this one fit either categories well. It\'s certainly fresh and office/business appropriate, though it\'s not the ""playful man in a dress shirt"" I expected. If you will, I get a ""serious business professional"" vibe from this one similar to F by Ferragamo Black. This is a great scent for the aspiring gentleman!', 'Cold weather freshie... weird to say, but it\'s true. I\'m gonna have a tough time working this into my rotation, because the colder seasons are usually the starting gun for me to wear some of the most interesting scents in my wardrobe, so Lacoste Pour Homme has a lot to compete with considering that it\'s too sweet and cloying for anything above 60F temp.  The plum is interesting, albeit rather synthetic. It\'s what makes this a not-your-usual fresh scent, especially since it sits on top of a dark/toasty/burnt type of vanilla. Just typing all of that out made me think this fragrance is more interesting than it is, but it\'s actually somewhat generic to an unfortunate degree. This allows it to have a youthful vibe. Safe, yes, but not overly impressive to those around you.  I got 1oz for $15, so I\'m not about to throw my hands up in disappointment. I can wear this to the supermarket, or when I\'m trying to be nondescript in a casual setting. You may find that it\'s an interesting change of pace from other Fall/Winter/cooler-Spring type scents, but there\'s just so many other options for that role. It might actually smell kind of classy on a teenager, so the younger crowd should perhaps consider this as a stepping stone or ""middle ground"" fragrance... something in the vein of Boss Bottled (functionally, not in terms of scent), but perhaps slightly less dated.  Performance is average on all fronts in my experience, with a generic vanilla skin scent lasting quite a while after the fresh aspects have burned out.', 'It is remarkable fragrance !!! The striking characteristic sweet ..... but I think a good reason, like, say, oriental fragrance case !! Erotic, sensual, emotional ..... but it may be the signature scent !! Particularly balanced ingredients !!  The wintry atmosphere, apples, plums, cinnamon summery atmosphere is balanced by the citrus chord. Sandalwood, vanilla sweetens until the pink pepper and juniper spice it ... All this will add rum to make her a unique and aromatic !! I must say that brilliant invention !! The first time can be a bit ""too much"" sweet SILLAGE but adequate good seasons environment ""takes all"" the crocodile .......

The longevity on my skin is absolutely fantastic (8-12 hrs) and it projects nicely also. I think for the price, this is a great scent for any age male but probably best for high schoolers-30 year olds (but not exclusive).

Very synthetic and somewhat dry. Not as sweet imo as other people mention - Joop, Paco, JPG Ultra are all far far sweeter but the light plum note is indeed interesting. It just seems like they added far too many ingredients and none were all that dominant or high quality. Nothing distinctive.  Its average imo and not sure why many youtube reviewers hype this one.

Cheers!', ""I got a decant of this and have worn it 3 times. I like this very much, however on me it becomes a skin scent almost instantly. None to little projection. So for that reason I probably won't buy a bottle of this. This is sweet and fruity and like someone else said has a slight soda pop feel to it. I can't pinpoint the fruit that I get from this. It's very safe and non offensive and would work in most situations. It is very sexy I think. But due to projection and the fact that I have other scents in this same genre that work better on my skin, I won't be getting a bottle. But I'd recommend this fragrance for sure to try.

Ladies love this scent i get compliments when i wear it.After wearing this for hour on so i get that rochas man vibe to it which is awesome.

Plus, I live in a warm, humid climate, and that doesn't seem to be what a lot of reviewers here think is the ideal place for LPH. I'm going with the reviewers who say this is more of a winter frag, since I can't see this happening in hot weather. Lacoste Pour Homme was confusingly bad on me. It smelled almost like someone got a lunch meal to go from a deli and there was a meaty sandwich with condiments and sides in a bag emanating from my wrist. Sad, because I had hopes for LPH. If for some reason I moved someplace with a winter, I might try it again. If this works for some people on hot, humid spring and summer days, more power to them. I would caution against someone blind buying this one though. In my limited experience, you really have to careful about any frag with strong vanilla in hot environments."", 'Absolutely Amazing! The Best by Lacoste in my opinion. The mix of Vanilla and Rum is kinda Awesome. I got few but not many compliments wearing it.

I say the name and she replies - ""It\'s Sexy!"". BUT i don\'t really got a good longevity in summer days nor a good sillage. So i guess its a Winter Fragrance afterall.

When i got it one month ago i tried it immediately... it was a bad experience, the heat with the sweetness didn't work right at all  Today as i noticed the cool fall weather outside my window, i decided to give it another chance. The opening was too sweet for me..i thought i made a mistake that will bother me all day (had no time to have a second shower)  As i got out to work, it started to dry down and to give me these pulses of dry sweet almost white chocolaty vibes...oh my god ....much much much better than i expected it's a real pleasant feeling that it gives... now am sitting in my office completely relaxed overwhelmed with the very smooth and sweet spice/vanilla/apple atmosphere ..... so for all those people who hated Lacoste pour homme from the first sniff, please don't repeat my mistake...follow the first 3 tips and be surprised of how wonderful journey it can take you"", ""Sweet and unpleasant.

It's a unique combination to me, but I'm not a big fan of these kinds of fragrances. I like the smell but I'm not sure how well it would work for hours on end. I sprayed a tiny amount on before I went to sleep and never experienced the drydown, just a strong opening. It's been compared to Boss Bottled/#6, but I like this one better, I think because the wood isn't as strong and it's a bit more complex. I also like the strong notes in this one, though I generally don't like ones this sweet. Here, the juniper and rum seem to keep the sweetness in check. The plum and spices provide a kind of tint to the fragrance but are never clear as notes to me. I'll have to update after I've given it a regular wearing. UPDATE: With a regular wearing what I'll say is that I don't like the first 20 minutes or so but then it settles in and is pleasant.

Very long lasting and decent projection if you find that it works for you. I gave this bottle away to a co-worker with a college bound son.', 'Lacoste Pour Homme is a very well constructed and balanced citric aquatic that though not innovative or uniquely original in conception, is outstandingly executed and one of the best aquatics on the market. The beautiful opening of citrus and apple integrates very well with the juniper and cinnamon that never offends and manages to hold a very reserved and balanced personality without ever overwhelming. One of the best uses of apple I have come across in a fragrance, it seems to give the grapefruit a bass from which to balance it against the spicier middle notes. Incredibly pleasing, becomes somewhat linear once the vanilla ripens over the middle and top notes, but the vanilla only seems to add a creamy note without losing its balance or becoming overly assertive. The sandalwood and cedarwood make for a light foundation that allows the vanilla and musk to come through unmolested. This give Lacoste Pour Homme a lighter feel but because the scent is so well balanced it doesn¬¥t detract from the overall scent in the slightest. Incredibly versatile, pleasing and refined. Longevity is not bad, 5-6 hours is the standard, though on some skin chemistries this one never goes beyond a skin scent after the initial thirty minutes of application so a blind buy may not work for everyone. The epitome of well executed, well blended and organically based.', ""I detect a nice, sweet and tart citrus in the beginning, almost like a lemon head. This is followed by vanilla and a spice that I can really feel. It's not overpowering at all. It's a very gentlemanly, warm scent that's an all around winner in my book."", ""Just had this last week got a free sample.  So let's see, Opening is kinda sweet with a dash of citrus. Then after an hour it kinda smells a little spicy then dries down to a nice woody vanilla finish. Projection is not that superb, which isn't a major problem. I can't really tell if the majority of the sweetness comes from the vanilla or rum since I always have this mysterious feeling when smelling it during after the dry down. To sum things up, a very nice everyday perfume can be worn day or not (though I recommend it during the day). Not to intruding or not too shy just a well balanced scent in my opinion.

I'm not an expert and I don't claim to know what each of the above listed notes smells like. That being said, for me, it starts out warm with the blended notes of cinnamon and vanilla. Just the right touch of vanilla for me as I'm not a fan of the rich, sickeningly sweet, gourmand vanilla. Maybe it's the pink pepper that keeps the vanilla in check, and as a result I don't consider this a vanilla scent overall. After about fifteen minutes the almost melon like grapefruit starts coming into the mix. Nice blend. I don't detect the apple at all. I have to say that each note has a degree of synthetic quality to it, but this is not a negative. I think this is what makes each note fit together so well to create a unique scent that in dry down is cool on my skin, and has a powdery quality to it. Not sweet, but a contradictory soft yet metal element. Very clean and understated. I like it more each time I wear it. It is not overtly masculine, but definitely not feminine.

Its comforting, relaxing and sexy. Signature material here.', ""So originally I dismissed this scent as this has a semi-harsh opening and is very synthetic. But this is a scent you have to give at least 2 wearings before you judge whether or not you like it.  Admittedly my opinion changed on this because of the compliments I received ! I put this on in the morning for the first time and liked it but didn't think it was special but then 5 hours later I received a compliment at work and then when I got home my girlfriend buried her face in my chest and said this might be one of her new favorites. She however didn't care for this when I sprayed it in the morning. This starts off with a fresh but zingy opening that's slightly synthetic but not completely off putting but still not entirely pleasant. Once this dries down though you get a very soft,vanilla scent that's masculine and also has a fresh edge to it as well. To my nose this smells like a fresh vanilla scented dryer sheet. The drydown to this is very addicting and pleasant and has a great balance of being fresh and sweet without being sickly sweet. My girlfriend said it's very comforting but also very attractive as well and reminded her of boss bottled but she likes this better. Performance on this is great ! It lasts 8-12 hours and projects very well. I thought it was below average but I've been complimented when I thought it disappeared which makes me believe your nose becomes nose blind to this pretty easily.

The actual smell is fine. Its nothing ground breaking. Sort of clean in a fruit way. I laugh when people talk about other people stating that the performance is awful. It is awful. This is a do-nothing fragrance..because it does nothing. It is linear, when its dry it is gone unless it is on cloth and then you have to press nostrils on it to pick it up.  This is typical of Lacoste. The brand creates scents that smell kind of good but have no performance. I don't know if its a strategy to keep customers applying the frag all day long therefore going through extreme amounts and thus buying more.. but lacoste certainly doesn't apply anything into giving their releases any longevity. My dog has farts that last longer.  What I use this for: I keep it in the bathroom and spray it on the towels and that helps keep the room smelling fresh and when we use a towel it smells nice. That is it. It is a towel freshener. I won't even give it a rating. It is almost as bad as Zihr Courderoy. lacoste is nothing but a low budget / gym fragrance brand. So yeah, I am a brand snob.

I don't know how it was when it was first released, or where all the notes went, but this latest incarnation (batch NH25) is totally linear on my skin. After a few hours, it dries down to a freshly laundered clothes smell and that's it. Unfortunately, I got myself a massive 150ml bottle, because it was under 30 Euros. So not worth it. It's now destined to become a very expensive toilet spray for guests to cover up the smell they've made. The only positive thing I can say is the bottle design is nice, and the juice is a very pleasant blue."", ""I received a sample of this in 2008, and was blown away by it. I still have a faint memory of that sillage. It was the quintessential cool, blue cologne for my 20yo self on a summer day. Then, I bought it... Somehow, I was repulsed by the full bottle. I couldn't believe this was the same thing I sampled. A harsh, synthetic blast that smelled just like any cleaning product. I could tell that it was the same cologne as the sample, but somehow the concentration and balance must have been different. I ended up giving most of the bottle away (about 12 years ago). A part of me still wonders if I can maybe get that sample 'version' again. If it wasn't for the sample that I liked so much, this would be tossed into the hate category."", ""Sweet and fresh.

Hard to describe, it was a long time ago since I last smelled it. The notes on here say fruity, I guess it is. I have a tendency to gravitate toward citrusy, at least I did when I was younger.  Nowadays, I gravitate more toward woody or warm spicy scents. This is an excellent cologne! It was my intro into Dunhill, a good designer. I stopped wearing it, but I wore it for a long time. I don't know why I stopped wearing it. I think I prefer to switch up scents! Great summer and spring cologne! Definitely a more aquatic and ozonic one.

The litchi/lotus combination with the both citruses is just too good to be true.that alone makes this fragrance worth the price. The sea notes and the addition of rose wood is just a match made in heaven.The rosewood emulates sooo many sweet woody aromatic nuances and the orange note is just there to compliment the top notes.sea notes make it salty/metallic but only an appropriate hint of it. The rosewood and lotus are by far THE MAIN STARS of this fragrance they‚Äôre the literal glue to this whole pyramid it brings it all together. The base notes compliment everything well together but not as good as the rosewood and lotus they create a sandalwood type of nuance on it which i solemnly adore.

Longevity is excellent and you have to be careful not to overspray, because it projects heavily.  It‚Äôs something you could wear on a holiday to a tropical resort, although I envision it on someone in their teens.

Plus Plus & Silver Scent have this aggravatingly ""purple"" grape accord that just agitates me and I can actually say that I\'d rather wear nothing than wear those fragrances. Desire Red is just as screechy with a metallic accord replacing the ""purple"" scent. Dunhill corrected this path with Desire Blue by removing the metallic accord of Desire Red and toning down the ""grape"" syrup accord of Plus Plus & Silver Scent. Desire Blue is completely likeable but still carrying a boisterous personality. A few reviews wrote this off as ""laundry detergent"" and I can completely see that aspect of Desire Blue, however, it\'s not soapy... just soft and fresh like most generic liquid laundry detergents. Desire Blue opens with sweet, juicy lychee, and aquatic accords. It\'s fresh and fun. A bit jarring due to it\'s projection, but good.

It's a clone of Dunhill Desire Blue, right down to the notes. The Tread & Miller fragrance is cheaper, and it is an EDP. I have it, and it's a good casual spring / summer scent. The litchi and lotus add that something a little more interesting up top. Performance on Tread & Miller's Aquatic is better than the Dunhill because it is an EDP concentration. Worth getting if you reside in South Africa."", 'I bought this for my hubby and I love this fragrance. It\'s a perfect everyday fragrance, that works best in between seasons, summer and spring.

I had seen this on sale for 20 dollars for at least 10 years at local pharmacies and never thought to look it up because I'm not generally into blue aquatic fragrances. When I did look it up, I saw that it had a lychee note and was super intrigued. By that time it was gone from the pharmacy shelves so I paid a few dollars more for a large size tester.  Best value ever. The lychee note is there at the opening but disappears into the wonderful blend later on. The tonka in this is heavy handed though and carries you through the mid until the musk comes in.  The ingredients, chemicals in this allow me to detect it for a full 12 hours across all stages however the projection reduces after the first two.  Because of the lychee, this will be used by me frequently. It's a great replacement for my Versace Pour Homme, and Ferragamo AE, this is just more interesting to me. I love this to wear when I know I'm going to be out all day with my family and it's warm out. Great value and a keeper!

But not in a bad way. Just don't go crazy on the atomizer and spray yourself 15-20 times. Very simplistic, yet very modern. It smells as if it could've been released yesterday. Not groundbreaking, but for $13 you can't complain; it smells like it could be easily double the price you can find it for at a Ross. It's mass appealing, and like the original Desire, it has great projection for the first 2 hours. On my skin, it's very aquatic and tropical fruity in the top with a light floral background. The mid is still aquatic but with a slightly sweet and resinous backbone lightly sprinkled with something woody. The base is quite wispy, smells like a faint mixture of tonka, amber, and musk. Performs well even through reformulations (I have a KK15 batch), a good 8-10 hours every time I've worn it. It's strong enough to wear all year round: projects and lasts enough to cut through the cold with more sprays, aquatic and fruity enough for the warmer parts of the year. Day time only, unless your significant other is gaga over Desire Blue. Very casual fragrance, more for going out to the beach, hanging with friends, likable enough to be used in the office (not too many sprays though). Too strong to be used after the gym, and doesn't come off clean but more marine. Anyone could wear it, but geared more for the younger crowd. Stood the test of time nearly 20 years later.

This differs from other blue fragrances as the shower gel and aquatic accords are not as dialed up as the fruity sweetness accords are. It‚Äôs also lacking the sharp ambroxan smell, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your preferences. It wears somewhat thick and heavy, yet it's still smooth.

Its aquatic but not typical ""ocean fresh with dash of citrus and lavender""-this is more fruity and as another reviewer noted, it almost has a melony scent(clearly its litchi).

If you like Desire Red but haven't tried this one I think you'll like it but you won't think it's quite as good. I however think this is a good flanker. It's a traditional aquatic fragrance but this has a little more backbone than some of the newer aquatics today. The sour ocean tinge in this goes in really nice with the fruits. It's a great fragrance and I think it's unisex as well. This is great for spring and summer. Honestly this is an all time great from the early 2000's along with Desire Red. I give this a 86/100.

This actually has a very unique opening that's very fresh,but also sweet and fruity and this has a fresh laundry smell but it smells like a laundry detergent that's maybe a tropical laundry detergent smell. The lichti in this is very unique and helps this be different BUT in the mid it's also slightly off putting as it causes the scent to a have a very faint rotten fruit note.  The drydown in this is the best part as that sharp,rotten fruit note you get in the mid fades and what remains is that fresh,laundry vibe you got in the opening only it's a lot more smooth and at this stage it almost smells like a unisex scent as I can also see women wearing this and enjoying this as well.  Performance on this is great ! On my skin this performs borderline beast mode for 2 hours and projects well for an additional 2 hours following that. Blue also lasts on my skin a total of 6-10 hours. Overall rating--- 6.5 out of 10 ! It's a nice scent that's actually quite unique and it performs well BUT it does come off a bit feminine and the mid of this fragrance almost causes me to dislike this scent.

I love it because it was one of the first bottles I bought, it was hard to find in my childhood city, and thats when everyone wanted to wear Dunhill Desire Red. I dont give a monkeys ass if people say it is synthetic mess, to me its so dear. Now the actual notes on this one, lychee, oranges and aquatic, with a bit of fresh herb maybe mint.  The base notes are overshadowed by the the lychee and oranges, and thats one thing I love about it, as I really find it annoying when perfumes turn into ambroxane and unrefined synthetic coumarin smell, which is not the case here.

I think its to do with memory more than the actual smell here, but this one puts a smile on my face, and thats more than enough for me !', ""The armoa chemicals used in this one were too much for me, generating an unpleasant experience. I did detect some of the original Desire and I was hoping the base would be nice, but those strong aroma chemicals that I encountered at first never dissipated enough for me to appreciate anything the perfumer was trying to do here. Fortunately, I found an old sample and it didn't cost me more than perhaps a few pennies."", ""An aquatic version of DIESEL PLUS PLUS, but instead uses green apple instead of red apple.

Makes me think of an aquatic version of the original Desire, has the same woody smell even though teak wood isn't listed on this one, but has rotten lychee in it instead of apple. Seriously, I can't get over that. Once it dries down it smells a little better, but all I can think of is that lychee in the beginning and it totally turns me off. Getting rid of this as soon as I can. You may have better results with this, so if you find it for dirt cheap, it's worth a try."", ""Gosh great bottle, I think Carolina Herrera CH Prive is based on this bottle. It is cool, minty woodsy.

Unfortunately I found that the opening of Dunhill desire blue is way too sweet in a cloying, candy-ish, synthetic way that makes you feel dizzy. In my opinion, this one would be miles better if the lychee note in the openning has more sourness kick that would make you feel a lot more refreshing. I live in a country where you can easily find seasonal lychees for a cheap price and believe me, the lychee note in this one, without the sourness of the fruit, is fake and cloying.  Not a typical blue summer fragrances. So, that might be good if you are looking for a summer fragrance that is a bit unique. The middle and dry down is a bit more acceptable though but the sweet dizzy opening will stay with you for quite a long time and you can still feel parts of it later on too. Good longevity and decent enough sillage.', 'To add....A lovely silage exudes from this scent - very addictive.', 'I would have to agree with a lot of the reviews that can point the notes. Now whether or not you appreciate or like this Desire ""Blue"" or not is up to each nose. It definitely does start off with a nice citrusy, orange and berry feel with mixes of the sea and rosewood. It is much lighter than the original, obviously for spring time . There is no way I would call this a sporty fragrance. And I think what makes it different from a lot of the other blue aquatics is that on the drydown it has a little more heavy sent that separates it from fragrances I would associate with those 25 and under. Alfred Dunhill is a mature image. I think they captured that here but the synthetic aldehydes make me not rank it up there and probably won\'t buy it again. The other thing is I find it to be a whole lot weaker than the original. Maybe it\'s because I wear when it\'s warmer outside, but something just doesn\'t carry or project very well with this.', ""Desire Blue is a very nice citrus/aquatic. It has a light, fruity, and soft opening. The heart of DB is the sea notes with a slight woody background. The litchi really stays noticeable throughout the length of this scent.

I can\'t pinpoint what I like about it; maybe it\'s that giant squid eyeball from the notes above. All in all, a nice wildcard aquatic that smells like a different fruit each time I wear it. It\'s a bit too sweet for me overall, but the rest is good enough to make up for it.', ""Well, I sprayed this on and liked it for about 30 seconds. Then I didn't. Then I did again.  There's something about the marine note in here that I don't care for. That fake synthetic saltiness calone can have seems to come and go. In a way it reminds me of Issey Miyake & Acqua di Gio, but I don't dislike it nearly as much as I do those two. The litchi note is definitely prominent. I get more bergamot than orange or mandarin. Lotus stands out as well and a pleasant warm woodiness from the rosewood. I'd say Desire Blue is better than your average aquatic."", ""Like the topnotes.

The litchi strongly grips Desire Blue from the beginning and overwhelms it with a synthetic dominance that destroys any chance of me enjoying this fragrance deep into the dry-down. It's green, yes, but it's also extremely high-pitched and synthetic. There's no real balance here as the mandarin and lotus serve as simple background noise and are too soft, allowing the litchi to overwhelm. What's left? Not much. A touch of woods and musk that still can't manage to extinguish the litchi and a heart of sea notes that only seems to worsen the synthetic vibe of this fragrance. I'm rarely negative but this is absolutely a scrubber in my humble opinion. Sure, it's unique and original for a male scent in that the litchi normally reserved for feminine scents take prominence here, but this is not quality organic juice by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, judging from my experience; it's a repellant and caused many a negative reaction when I tested it at work, the gym and at home.  Sure longevity is quite good at around 6-10 hours and sillage extremely strong the first 3-4 hours of wear before settling down to a moderate level of projection, but very few men want to smell like this.

This is like Georgio Beverley Hills Wings Homme or Jacques Bogart Silver Scent and very synthetic 1.5 hours - 3.5 hours. 7 inch projection. Softening a little, thank goodness. I get flickers of what it is what trying to do - it is trying to be sexy and I think it falls short. 3.5 hours - 5 hours - 4 inch projection. Its getting more diluted, more alluring, less harsh, the best bit. Much more like a freshie scent and very nice and alluring. Worth the wait, yes I think so 5 hours - 7 hours. 3 inch projection, but subtle. It trails more than projects 7- 9 hours. Close to skin The bottle lid which flips sideways is really cheap and plasticy, so I recommend those who like bottles should stay away This is 85% the same as Dunhill Red but Blue is like a more aqua/diluted version of Red and more modern and fresher This is not really a fresh summer chilled frag- the start is far from it and it is harsh and bitter, though at the end gets really quite nice and alluring and watery- is it worth the wait? Try it and see? After a couple of hours it is very fresh and alluring', ""I am surprised I like this as much as I do. First, it is not an aquatic fragrance. There is an aquatic note in this, but it's not at all dominant, and it's really well blended so as to give lightness and lift to the sweet soapiness of the fragrance. Desire Blue is a true flanker of Desire For Men. They are VERY similar in that they both have a sweet, floral soapiness that dominates and defines both fragrances. Blue is drier, not quite as sweet, and a lot greener smelling than Desire For Men. It reminds me a lot of Greenbriar by Caswell-Massey, or even a cross between Cool Water and Irish Spring Soap. This isn't really my style because it's sweeter than what I usually like to wear, and it's not very unique, but its cheerful, uplifting smell is hard to resist. MY RATING: 7.5/10"", 'This is initially quite subtle smelling but projects well. It is fresh and slightly sweet but with green notes as well. Balances fresh and green and masculine. It feels aquatic rather than heavy and gets slightly soapy and deeper late on. There is a definite vanilla vibe to me, despite no vanilla in the listed notes. Based on 2 sprays it is subtle but for 3 or 4 hours it projects very well. By 6 hours it is close to the skin. By 8 hours it is fading and going. With 4 sprays it seems to last almost twice as long.

Finally the rosewood comes to play its part, which is not being a strong one, it's light and more youthful form in Desire Blue.

I expected an aromatic aquatic and this is classified as an aromatic green and now I see why. I loved Desire for a Man and expected this to be a watery weak scent and it is nothing of the sort... This is crafted in the classic style of three scent 'chords' composed of four 'notes' each. I find scents made in this fashion very well-balanced and usually harmonise well on my skin. This begins with the zesty citrus of mandarin and bergamot but has the subtle sweet juiciness of lychee and the soft floralcy of aquatic lotus flower...heavenly! The citrusy water vibe continues in the heart, accented by rosewood (yum) and mahogany, is very crisp and unique. This projects very well for a 'blue' scent. The drydown is smooth and sexy with sweet tonka and warm, smooth benzoin balancing amber's richness and a very clean musk. All through a wearing of this you are delighted by different nuances between the notes and accords present. When I wore it last a few days ago I did a lot of fast walking in mid-70 degree temperatures and full sun and my body heat seemed to magnify and project the scent without getting a sweatiness or sourness to it, as some citrus heavy scents can.

Armani mania is a great edt, refined and well crafted. It is a nice blend of Orange, saffron, cedar, musk, amber and spicies. This is in the same league of those fragrances of the early 00, like lancome hypnose, lancome miracle or cacharel nemo. Not the same smell but similar vibe. Armani mania is a good compromise of elegance, sexyness, fun and maturity. So it's very versatile, not too mature but never teeny, elegant and casual at the same time. Now u can feel it comes from another era but it's not dated at all, it's easy to wear and has its own personality. If you find for a good price and love the colognes of the early 00 u can risk a blind buy. None can say it smells bad, maybe not groundbreaking but never bad. Average performance, better for fall and spring. Give it a chance! I also tried the Summer mania eau fraiche version. Great flanker, it's almost the same smell but more invigorating and fresh. Approved. Armani mania √® un profumo quasi dimenticato e secondo me ingiustamente. Colonia speziata, calda e fresca allo stesso tempo. √à elegante ma anche casual, sexy ma anche disimpegnata. Se vi piacciono i profumi dei primi anni 2000 Armani mania non deluder√†. Performance normale.

Armani discontinued Mania because it‚Äôs boring. Now that we have that out of the way, let‚Äôs talk about the fragrance. It is really, really good. A beautiful scent dominated by saffron and woods, with a beautiful musk underlying all of it. It is extraordinarily well done, and I can see why Francis Kurkdjian once said this was among his favourite creations. A welcome departure from the slew sickeningly sweet fragrances, Mania comes across as almost savoury. Where other fragrances would cry out with a nauseating blend of citruses, Mania is content to sit close to the skin with a subdued mandarin, which provides JUST enough brightness and lift to the overall composition to stop you from smelling like a spice rack. It‚Äôs gorgeous, and ties everything together beautifully. But it‚Äôs boring. It‚Äôs linear, the projection and longevity leave a lot to be desired, and it doesn‚Äôt INSPIRE me. It‚Äôs simplistic, linear and relatively weak. To be completely fair to Mania, its simplicity is its greatest strength. If it was padded out with a million notes that only a bloodhound could smell, it‚Äôd take away from the composition at large. Mania was intended to be simple, straightforward and unassuming. And that‚Äôs fine, it does that VERY very well. I have a great deal of respect for fragrances that choose to exercise restraint rather than try to reinvent the wheel.  It‚Äôs as offensive to modern sensibilities as Raisin Bran or dry Weetbix. You won‚Äôt find anyone who hates it, but I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll find anyone that has a nosegasm after smelling it. This is the quintessential ‚Äúyou smell nice‚Äù fragrance. People won‚Äôt make a conscious note of it, but they‚Äôll notice that‚Ä¶ well. You smell nice. And really, what more can anybody ask for? Mania is worth trying if you can find it, but not at the ridiculous asking prices you find today. I‚Äôd cap it off at $100-150 a bottle. There may not be many perfect clones of it out there these days, but remember. This was designed to be a nice, versatile designer fragrance. It wasn‚Äôt artisanal and it didn‚Äôt shake up the industry. There are thousands of other ‚Äúnice, versatile designer fragrances‚Äù out there, many of which I feel are more deserving of their prices than Mania. With that said, if you can find it for a good price, I‚Äôd say go for it. It may not knock your socks off, but I doubt it‚Äôll disappoint, either. It‚Äôs a solid fragrance, and a shame it was discontinued in favour for some of the louder, more screechy Code fragrances.', 'It was great! For me it was the best of Armani!', ""An all-time great. A shame it was discontinued. Fortunately, the Dua dupe is like a 96% match, so I've been using that instead of having to pay outrageous prices on eBay."", 'The best Armani fragrance ever QED This wipes the floor with the countless codes and anything they come up with nowadays, no contest.

At the time, there was nothing else like it. Spicy, sweet, woody, mysterious and elegant. Easy to wear, and versatile enough for work, casual or formal occasions. Some of the blue fragrances hit similar marks these days, but nothing I\'ve come across smells like this. Mania was a study in contrasts: Warm and inviting, cool and smooth, somehow light and dark, with a greenish spiciness that drew me (and others) in. One Friday night in 2004, I was on a crowded bus with a bunch of other young professionals headed into the city for a good time. The guy in in front of me was wearing this, as was I, and we turned to each other and smiled and briefly chatted about the recognition. We both said it was the first time we\'d encountered others wearing it, and that we were glad it wasn\'t as common as ADG and Polo Blue, etc. etc. etc. Now I bet we both wish it had been just a little more popular with the masses. I lost this in a move ~2006-07, didn\'t replace immediately and have been crying ever since. It\'s not worth the hundreds you\'ll pay online, but it sure was nice in its day.', 'Kinda boring and simple. Better fragrances for the price it is at now', 'A beautiful, well crafted fragrance, even though it is not laud or with a strong sillage. It was concieved especially in this way. A kind of muted perfume very suitable for office or dinner - places where a fragrance could be annoying. It is expensive and rare now but if you find it for a resonable price, don t hesitate.', 'Please release it again.. it is so nice for summer and also fresh.', ""Pleasant smelling cedar-musk fragrance which at times is a bit too simple. Opening is rather bitter-spicy (reminiscent of a tamer saffron opening found in MFK's Oud EDP) with the saffron and a hint of (bitter) citrus, which then blends into a nice mix of cedar, musk and some vague, ephemeral sweetness. It's obviously not the most daring fragrance Kurkdjian has done but it's refreshing smelling something like this from the early 00's which, even though discontinued, still smells quite modern. Because we're so used to smelling fairly sweet fragrances for men nowadays, this might be a welcome change for someone scoping out some of these older releases. Performance is average, rather light overall in terms of projection but for me that's not an issue. All in all, a decent musky cedar scent. Might be worth it only if you can find it for a reasonable price. 7/10"", ""Got a 50ml in 2013 and loved it. Still have around 2cm left in the 100ml bottle and hardly use it because I don't want it to run dry. Such an evocative scent for me personally.

It'd been a few years (10+) since I smelled this, so I figured I'd try it again for that price (fell for the discontinued hype). To me, it's a simple, citrus/woods scent. Nothing special and smells very much of the late 90s, early 00s. Pleasant, clean, inoffensive, uncomplicated. A day time, work wear scent. Performance, for me, was short: 3-5 hours max and a skin scent quickly. Could be due to the bottle age but it smells basically how I remember it, so I'm not sure what, if any, effect age had on it.  A 6.75/10 for me. I'd never, ever pay retail, let alone discontinued, prices for this. Too simple, too short lived, too forgettable.

This fragrance was perfectly balanced graphite-amber, citrus, and a water note (clear water, not blue water), pure class eternal. Only those in the know used it, and kept it a secret. The ladies went absolutely nuts for this stuff.  It was like it had magical powers because it only attracted beautiful women.  Average looking women when ask said it was ""ok"" but beautiful women would say it was ""incredible"" The silage was unusually weak though and you had to learn how to wear it.  You had to spray about 8-10 sprays but it would not smell overwhelming, but then it would last and gently waft 10+ hours without fading. It is so unusual to find a fragrance that would not overwhelm you at 10 sprays and yet keep pumping out the fragrance for so long. I don\'t think I will ever find another fragrance just like Mania I have a 1 full bottle left but I never use it, unless there is a woman that I want to impress.

This fragrance was way ahead of its time! Something like this will be infinitely collectible in a few years. It had no flankers, which in my mind makes it even more valuable.

But it still has a freshness, that smells like a liberating spring day. Amazing. The middle notes are very masculine and a little sharp, but still softened up by the top- and basenotes. It\'s in the middle notes, the metalish face appears. The face that can appear like a ""new car"" or ""new tv"" scent. In the base, it\'s very soft, clean, pleasant, sophisticated, subtle...

It was a blind buy though well worth the risk! Many reviews I've read have put Mania down saying it's nothing special, but I disagree - I really like it. In the opening I get a sweet hit of what I can best describe as fresh lime and vodka with a tad of aldehydes. Soon after it calms down to a persistent velutinous fabric and leather vibe; reminiscent of a brand new car interior with leather seats or a new tailor shop full of new suits. Mania evokes images of virginal luxury cars, a modern gentleman in a suit an tie, a very new office suite. This fragrance holds the Armani signature that takes me back to the mid-late 1990s, maybe it's the amber note that attains this mawkishness. Yes, the notes in this fragrance are simple however wearing this fragrance I regard it as sophisticated, interesting and suitable for use at the office or during a night out. Would I use it for a date? Yes I probably would. Longevity is decent, minimum of 5 hours and sillage is not tenacious but modest.

It smells nice but forgettable, classy but not very interesting or compelling. I almost kept this based off the opening alone but it's just too short-lived and the rest of it doesn't do anything for me. Final rating, 6.5/10.

An underrated classic from Armani."", 'One of Armani\'s best and most underrated fragrances, and a very versatile one at that.  Decidedly falls into the fresh-clean category, opening with sparkling, lightly sweet citrus, like one would think of popping the top on a refreshing, gourmet citrus soda. But giving way to lightly spicy and woody notes, with a dash of watery/aquatic as well...but never losing its light cleanliness.  Suitable for everything from casual/sporty to formal/elegant, inoffensive, and deliberately crafted with sleek refinement, its wide wheelhouse never causing it to lose its distinction. Perhaps better suited for spring/summer months, an otherwise ""can\'t go wrong here"" scent that, in my opinion, is far superior to the very ubiquitous Armani Code.  (One disclaimer. Due to the dominant fresh-clean accord, as well as its accompanying woody-spicy notes, having this fragrance will likely eliminate the need for certain others. For example, I learned upon re-purchasing this old favorite that I no longer needed Jack Black\'s Blue Mark, Ineke\'s Derring-Do, YSL\'s L\'Homme Libre, and C.O. Bigelow\'s Elixir White in my collection.)

This page is for the men's version of Armani Mania.. Someone should put it back the way it was!"", ""I work with a guy who has just turned 50. He's very dapper and he smells amazing. When I asked him what his fragrance was he told me it was Armani Mania. It's a perfect office scent - very pleasant, very professional, not too 'shouty', a solid amount of projection, plus it lasts on him all day. The other day I actually knew he'd arrived at the office by his scent before I'd even laid eyes on him. Gotta say, I'm impressed. The only problem is, if I bought a bottle of Mania for myself, I couldn't wear it to work as it's totally his signature scent."", ""Reviewing Armani Mania is tough for me, as I want to approach it somewhat objectively. Let me start by disclaiming that I absolutely adore Mania. It's such an elegant, understated scent. It clicked with me, right from the very first moment I smelled it. However, I'll attempt to be objective - even though I am at heart a completely subjective reviewer. I always try to approach all fragrances with the goal of giving an impression of what the scent is like, but the verdict is always subjective - my personal take on the scent. To give some background, Mania falls in to that woody style that was quite popular in the late 90's and early 2000's. Gucci Rush for men was one of the first that set the template. Versace Man turned it upside down with sweet amber, tobacco and saffron. Gucci Pour Homme I made it dark and austere with incense and a woodsy overload. Mania however, takes the playful route. It opens with a peppery mandarin orange and a boatload of saffron. The saffron is right there from start to finish, and it's beautifully done. It's not the most complex saffron rendition, but it captures the essence of the scent of fresh saffron flowers. The mandarin and saffron notes are joined in the mid by the 2000's mainstay - cedar. It's an obviously synthetic rendition, but it works perfectly here. I also get a hint of smoky vetiver, giving it some depth in the middle. The base is a fairly uneventful musky amber. It's very subdued and is in the background. I get the impression that it's really only there to make sure that the cedar and saffron persist, and it joins those two in a great unison. However, I must approach this fairly. It isn't all rose-y red and spectacular. Mania certainly has it's flaws. 1. It's synthetic. Much like Versace's The Dreamer, they are both created in a hyper-synthetic mold. In The Dreamer it works perfectly, as the scent comes across as being quite futuristic. However in Mania, it seems cheaper. That's not to say that the scent smells cheap, but the ingredient quality is surely lacking a bit. The mandarin and saffron aren't especially distinctive, and I do get the idea that Mania was made to a budget. 2. Mania can come across as too reserved. Compared to Code, Mania is more grown up and understated. But it's almost too understated. I don't want it to cut through the room, but Mania is very close to the skin. Some may like this, I don't mind it, but it'd be interesting to see what Armani could do with a intense version of this. All in all, I consider Mania to be a phenomal scent. The longevity is quite good too - 7-8 hours. Rating: 8.5/10"", 'I am quite unpleasantly surprised about longevity. It is only around 3 max. 4 hours even though I am spraying 3-4times instead of 1-2 as usual. Fragrance itself is lets say enjoyable but I could definitely live without this one and still prefer Code or very similar Burberry rhythm 1 or Allure.', ""This was the first scent I ever bought way back when. It was a blind buy, but I probably couldn't have picked a better scent for myself at the time. Citrus/cedar short opening and then the saffron kicks in, then the woodiness comes in later.  Its kind of perfect for an office more than anything, or general daytime use.  It probably would have been a very popular fragrance, but: it goes to a skin scent very quickly, and it is a bit too synthetic smelling and also alcohol. But it makes this little impression that stays with you. Someone here referred to it as a guilty pleasure and I second that."", 'A beautiful, highly elegant scent that is a more spicier version of its younger brother, Emporio Armani Lui.

As I marked Le Male as a BAD fragrance, later that fragrance surprised me a lot when winter comes here. Im testing Mania on winter, so probably I didn't take its full potential. Mania has a very light vibe, not a sex fragrance and in your face, but a very calm and slightly 'im in control of the situation'. This fragrance is not monster projection, but very intimate one -like d&g the one-. The tangerine and musk here are very light, the amber is almost invisible, cedar and vetiver are more dominant notes. Now, projection and longevity are very weak -the bottle is from sephora in Paris so its legit- but I¬¥ll not forget to try it on spring and I cant wait until there. for now.. 6/10"", ""Giorgio Armani - Mania Most people will like it.Espacially girl I think.For my nose it smell really like Versace Pour Homme.The top note is really good.Don't know is that saffron?

I have never come across anybody else that wears this. Usually Aqua Di-gio is what everyone has even though that doesn't smell bad by any means.

When you spray it, the first thing you're going to smell is the alcohol, but just for few seconds, and then it's a wonderful saffron-cedar with a little spice smell, it's just gorgeous. Smells so modern, luxurious, and yet casual and of course masculine. I know this fragrance doesn't project much, but it is actually last quite long on my skin, 6-8 hours, and will sometimes project if you move. I bought it just simply cause it smells just great and unique. This scent will smell even better if they amplified the power. The closest one to Armani Mania is YSL L'homme, it's not that similar, but in a quick sniff(with my amateur nose, haha) it's like they're almost in the same category. YSL L'homme is sweeter and woodier though, and has more power than Mania. So, in conclusion, is this a pass, try or buy? I'll say give this a try, because it smells great and unique, and you still might get a great projection/longevity from this fragrance because everyone's skin reacts differently to one scent.

It has been a while since last using Armani Mania... What a pleasant surprise..!! Mania is a successful blend of floral, fruity, musk, and woodsy notes that I truly enjoy. It opens with a burst of the floral and fruity notes then settles close to the skin with woodsy notes and musk finish. In my (humble) opinion, Mania breathes ""class"" like a fresh laundered shirt, but offers great flexibility to include wearing with a comfortable pair of jeans and that favorite t-shirt. Additionally, given the fruit and floral notes of the fragrance, the target time(s) of year may be Spring and/or Summer, however, if your body chemistry allows the musk and/or woodsy notes to project, Mania could be worn any time of year or for any occasion. Very well done Mr. Armani..!! Longevity and projection/sillage are moderate, making it ideal for an office setting, but sufficient some 4-6 hours later saying, ""gee, I still smell Armani Mania"". It lasts much longer on clothing. While I haven\'t had favorable comments from the opposite sex, i.e. the ""Wow Factor"", it has the potential. Not sure how many of my female employees feel comfortable saying, ""gee boss, you smell great today..!!"". To reiterate, Armani is a ""class"" scent that has great potential for the ""Wow Factor"". I would like to acknowledge the reviews submitted by Pravda48 and Padme Santal providing credibility to the potential of Mania. Very nice reviews...  Similar to the fragrance, the bottle is a classic design. I am drawn to the clear glass bottles to allow the user to see the clarity of the fragrance. The ""smoky"" color of the fragrance, and perhaps tint of the glass, adds to the positive mystique of the fragrance. The packaging is also well done.  A check of the online pricing of Mania, shows that it is still moderate to medium pricing (in the $50 - $100 USD) range. For that price and the quality of the scent, it is highly recommended to add this to your collection. Out of a possible five (5) stars, my evaluation of Armani Mania comes in at 4.4 stars. Great fragrance... Daily I.M. - Ride the wave and don\'t ask where it goes...', 'Nothing to become maniacal about, but not bad. It doesn\'t strike me as being especially unique or individual, and went on smelling somewhat mass market and uninteresting. The key is in the drydown, when it eventually arrives at a nice, understated woodsy note. At least it does on my skin.  This is one of those countless ""safe for office"" scents which I normally scorn. But on me it smells calculatedly pleasant, like one of those Jack Black ""Mark"" scents.  I wouldn\'t run out and buy a bottle, but I wouldn\'t spurn one, either. No sillage to speak of, longevity is a few hours.', ""I smelled this on an older gentleman who's a friend of mine (I'd guess he's 50ish) and it's SO sexy! (Don't judge me! lol) It's a very fresh, inviting peppery saffron/cedar scent complimented perfectly by just the tiniest touch of mandarin. I really really like it! If it wasn't inappropriate to sniff him I would! =P"", ""I think I misjudged this one initially that I have been wearing off and on for about a year. Citrus opener that fades quickly as a lightly floral/woodsy aroma that is fresh, at times almost powdery takes over. Hint of musk. The longevity is quite good although the lack of projection may lead you to think otherwise. Stays close to the skin but emerges in the most wonderful way as your body temp goes up a little (on a lunch hour walk). My wife had trouble even detecting it on me while we drove to work this morning, even sniffing at my wrist. Sort of shrugged her shoulders and did not demand that I stop driving and disrobe. Bummer. I would say it's good any time, any season but I'm biased living in NM where even shorts are often good any season. Classy and elegant for office use but also classy casual. I like it a lot"", 'There is something in common with Bvlgari¬¥s fragrances, maybe B.Soir or B.Pour Homme... but I agree with Thief of Hearts that noticed ""plastic eletronics"" aroma in it.

Its not only that I\'ve smelt this frag a hundred times before, or that so many people wear it, it\'s that I\'ve been told by SO MANY sales-monkeys to try this one and I never do. But today, with a time limit to look around, I tries it. Initially it was nothing. ""Let it dry"" I thought.  10 minutes later, nil. Half hour later, nope, nothing special happened.  What do I look like? Ok, it\'s not Armani\'s fault that nobody who suggested it ever seems to have any taste, given the barrage of these ""safe-bet"" suggestions they throw at me, but to think that me, the guy who goes in nearly every afternoon to exploit their good will (in letting customers freely wear their products on the sly) to try perfumes and constantly say ""nah I\'ve tried it, nah I\'ve tried it"", would actually think this unimagined tripe would impress me? Come on. I don\'t think these people actually know their product. Anyone who wants to chat with me about them always has such awesome suggestions; Womanity, Marc Jacobs men, D&G La Force. But keep the sales-monkeys away from me and stop trying to get me to pay top dollar for...THIS! Well, it smells fine, just not worth paying much for...unless you like that sort of thing.', 'Wonderful! Discreet, sensual and unique.5/5', 'I found Aramani Mania full of cedar ! You can barely smell the other notes. I couldn\'t find any ""real"" spice in it, considering it is marked ""Woody Spicy"". The orange is a barely notable at first & then it vanishes. It gets flowery during the dry down & you\'ll end up with a flowery cedar smell.  It does last long, really long, it is an Aramni after all. The price is too much for such smell. 6/10', ""I tested Armani Mania EDT on a card and enjoyed it, the opening was very light citrus and fastly changed to a warm woody (maybe the musk), this second part was nothing original, some would call it generic, but even like this i felt pleased. I sprayed on my skin and still liked it, i hadn't much time to wait and bought the same way. Now I'm a little disappointed 'cause it's not a remarkable frag and IT LASTS 15 MINUTES on me. Being optimistic, you can feel sth until 1 hour. At least I bought a 100ml bottle and can reapply, but i dont know... I think when you reapply the perfume (talking about all perfumes) isn't the same thing, it smells i don't know, but i have the impression that there's sth that smells cheap. Probably 'cause you don't feel the opening and the evolution of the perfume, it just gets stronger. I disagree that's a typical male scent, I'm a woman and now im using it in the winter. Where i live the winter is from 0 to 18¬∞C and isnt very dry, in fact is a bit humid, then, as it's a light frag, you can still use it. But i think in the summer i'll pass it to my boyfriend 'cause the masculine notes will stand out with the elevated temperature. I won't buy it again, for the ordinary scent and mainly for the zero staying power. But it's not a bad perfume. Remember everything I said was about the EDT (in fact i haven't seen the edp version), I don't know if the parfum lasts long and if is the same arome. PS: I'm using it for work, don't recomend for night as it's very light and soon you wont feel anything."", 'It has notes of citrus entry and fleeting, almost immediately giving rise to the base notes are a nice mix of young timber with some touches of ozone, slightly spicy base notes are almost identical. EDT is a very suitable for very young men, little formal for someone above 25 years. Almost any season, for use in night, I think the best use is in a nightclub, no formal events. Its potential for seduction think no more than a first impression, it is relatively easy to confuse their scent.', ""This fragrance, Starwalker by Mont Blanc and Chic By Carolina Herrera are three of my top fragrances. Mania is seriously underrated, I belive it's because it's overshadowed by Armani Code namely and other men's fragrances in the Armani line.  I don't mind that though, we can call this one Armani's best kept secret. You don't have to worry about too many people wearing this frag (well at least where i'm from it's not a concern).  Mania is like one of those obscure, quaint little restaurants, that don't seem to offer much on the outside and only you and a selective few know about it. The food is awesome, The setting is dim, the environment is smokey and sophisticated people mingle quietly.  The notes are warm and inviting and it dries down into a kind of sweet woody scent that lingers like the smoke that dances up into the atmosphere after the flame from a candle has been put out.  That's Mania in a nutshell."", ""Hmm...this perfume to me is SO generic. Boring..nothing special.  It's typical of a male scent and definately not differernt enough for me to go out and buy. Smells like alot of other things out there..where is the PIZAZZ? To describe I would say it's like a clean spice. But..boring! I have the mini and am gonna use it for work as I don't feel it's special enough for anything else."", 'Love it especially after the first 10 minutes or so this one will always have a spot in my collection. works very well with my chemistry everyone loves this when I have it on especially my lady she loves to come in close and sniff my neck.', 'this is some weird juice indeed. It starts with a familiar medicinal smell, due to the saffron and then mingles in with the woody and orange notes. In the end you get a truly complex scent, but the saffron just keeps lingering somewhere in the background and spoils everything.', 'Giorgio Armani: Great name but maybe not in perfume world.

This is a fragrance that I don't get super-excited about, but I find pleasant enough to wear, and to even buy again. Mania has a fresh herbal opening, with a lot of lift. I guess I can sort of smell the cedar/vetiver middle, but it's pretty subtle to me. The dry-down is a light spicy musk that reminds me of the dry down in Azzaro Visit, but lighter and with less punch. After a few minutes a the amber starts to peek through, but it never becomes a really dominant note. The musk rules. Over all, a very nice casual fragrance. Something nice for everyday wear that's interesting enough not to be totally pedestrian. It could sort of work for date wear as well, but I would go with something more bold like Emporio Armani Night."", 'such a winner! very ideal for office wear.', 'Yeah very elegant and sexy fragrance', 'I always forget about how wonderful this fragrance is. It gets lost in my collection.  But when I wear it, I remember why I bought it in the first place. It opens up with a wonderful madrin citrus note with hints of spice(Saffron). I feel like a am drinking a Mimosa while preparing to make some Paella (before the seafood is added).  After about twenty minutes or so, the wonderful cedar and vetiver notes appear.  Then it warms down to a very sensual dark amber and musk scent.  You would think I would remember this, because it one of my few bottles in my collection that is a quarter full.

I love this community but sometimes it's just a clown show"", 'Francis Kurkdjian\'s masterpiece, in my opinion, and like most artist their best work is overlooked. This fragrance was perfectly balanced graphite-amber, citrus, and a water note (clear water, not blue water), pure class eternal. Only those in the know used it, and kept it a secret. The ladies went absolutely nuts for this stuff.  It was like it had magical powers because it only attracted beautiful women.  Average looking women when ask said it was ""ok"" but beautiful women would say it was ""incredible"" The silage was unusually weak though and you had to learn how to wear it.  You had to spray about 8-10 sprays but it would not smell overwhelming, but then it would last and gently waft 10+ hours without fading. It is so unusual to find a fragrance that would not overwhelm you at 10 sprays and yet keep pumping out the fragrance for so long. I don\'t think I will ever find another fragrance just like Mania I have a 1 full bottle left but I never use it, unless there is a woman that I want to impress.

Seriously thats about all I got. It‚Äôs good tho. There is something in it that I‚Äôm allergic to and I still wear it so that can give you an idea of my fondness. It‚Äôs very beachy and I guess sunscreen and coconut on the top. Silage is mediocre and longevity is not good. Still a great scent, value is moderate.  Tonka, aqua, and sweet pepper on the back. It doesn‚Äôt last long but for modern scents that is what one might expect. A few sprays and you‚Äôre ready to go do beach things or have brunch. Maybe even a backyard game of catch. It‚Äôs unisex in my opinion and not something you will encounter many people wearing. 7/10 because it‚Äôs inexpensive. There‚Äôs so much in this price range that could do worse and many which can do better.

I was so excited to receive it and also to find out it smelled exactly how I remember it but the performance is abysmal.

Marc Jacobs for Men was a breakthrough for me, cutting hard against the tropes of designer scents and giving me a foundation of understanding of what niche scents were aiming at. This stands shoulder-to-shoulder with a scent like Philosykos. The bottle captures the essence of the fragrance beautifully; heavy and dense, yet soft around the edges.', ""It was 2004 and upon visiting my Cousin I caught a fragrance from him which I thought was unbelievably good. I sneaked to his bathroom cabinet when he was out and found the bottle - Marc Jacob. I had to get it. Fast forward a few months and i'm in Portugal on a golfing holiday with family and family friends. My older brother's scent at the time was Paul Smith and he wore it like he bathed in it. A plethora of compliments everywhere he went on how great he smelled. Up steps yours truly, wearing this Marc Jacob scent.  One after the other I hear women saying to their friends or partner, 'Mmm what is that lovely smell?' Before long they would try to sniff out who was wearing it and land on me, begging me to tell them what i was wearing. Night after night i'd have women coming up to me asking to sniff me, then walking away satisfied.  My brother by this time was becoming agitated, and would insist on them smelling his Paul Smith, the response being, 'Yeah don't get me wrong that's nice, but, THAT is, *face literally pressed against my neck and earlobe* ahh my god that is amazing.'  The attraction i got was literally insane. The longevity weren't bad but wasn't great either which is why i sprayed my top aswell as my skin to prolong the smell. All in all though, in the warm climate this made women giddy at the knees and pulled me some gorgeous women during those 7 days, and i'm not exactly an oil painting.  Everytime i smell this now it brings back some great, no TRULY great memories. I've worn many fragrances but never received anywhere near the attention this got."", ""It was the night of my 18 birthday in 2007 when I first smelled this on someone. It was so different to whatever else the guys were wearing back then. It stuck out so much I had to buy a bottle - probably using up my week's student allowance... I love it. I have probably outgrown it by a few years, but I keep a bottle to bring back the memories. A shame that it's been discontinued. I have only smelled it 2-3 times on anyone else. Not revolutionary by any means, but a great unique fragrance of it's time."", 'I bought a bottle of this in 2004 and I thought I had read that it was a gardenia scent. Apparently I was confusing this with the feminine fragrance of the same name. However, the entire time I wore this (2004-2005) I smelled gardenia and musk in this because that‚Äôs what the power of suggestion can do. In retrospect, it‚Äôs not that far-fetched since green and floral notes combine with coconut and fig to create a soft unisex creamy floral that can, with some misinformation, make the leap to gardenia. So I am sticking with my original description of this in its‚Äô vintage prime: Marc Jacobs Man once smelled like a memory, something washed away by rain and time, of a glamorous dandy in white tie and black sequined tuxedo slippers, wearing a fresh gardenia boutonniere still chilled, straight from the florist‚Äôs fridge. It‚Äôs not the kind of scent that paints a vivid picture, crisp with detail. It‚Äôs more like a watercolor or a blurry photograph. And that is appropriate for Marc Jacobs who often takes gaudiness of fashion past and recontextualizes it by presenting it in a new way in the blurred, light-saturated, pale photographs of Juergen Teller.', 'I was utterly in love with this fragrance when it was first launched... Sophisticated, elegant, discreet - nothing similar to the usual bombardment of masculine fragrances. The bottle was gorgeous, the name was simple! However, I believe it suits better younger ages. When I was 20 it was perfect. It had this na√Øvet√©, this care-free attitude. I don‚Äôt feel it expresses me any longer. Also, something has changed sadly in the quality of the juice. After half an hour you can hardly detect it on your skin. I recently tried it in New York in an attempt to reminisce... The past belongs to the past!', ""When I sampled this I thought it was pretty nice but when I purchased a full bottle I felt like I wasted my money because of the similarities to good life and new york musk. All of these fragrances are crazy similar even in The weak strength. They all smell good but miss the mark of ever becoming a signature scent due to how low the silage and projection is as well as short longevity. I won't be rebuying this because I already have goodlife and NY musk and feel as if I wasted money on both, now I have one more fragrance that smells similar but isn't gonna get much wear."", 'This perfume made me realise how much i detest fake fig fragrances... its not for me and i hate when i smell it on others too', ""I was working event for COTY, who now owns Marc Jacobs, Vera Wang, and Calvin Klein perfumes among others after they bought Procter & Gamble fragrance division, and it was given me as a present. On opening it smells like a hair spray. Later it smells like all mainstream perfumes, both male and female, were mixed in one giant barrel, and then watered down in half.  Totally faceless uninspiring perfume.  I can only see me wearing this if I'll go shopping in Walmart, which I do no more often than once in 2-3 years. I guess it would make it a gift of a lifetime? LOL Scent: 3 out of 10 Longevity: 5 of 10 Projection: 4 of 10 Silage: 4 of 10 EDIT: Ok, after giving it few more tries, it is little bit better than I originally thought.

About six months ago I called to confirm this with the company and it is still available for purchase on Marc Jacobs website and in his boutiques.

Needless to say I love it ! :)', 'I enjoyed this ,it smells like milky coconut,but the longevity is substandard. Perhaps if it came in a smaller bottle i would buy a little but not a big bottle. You could get a similar effect with coco butter lotion I feel that this is unisex as with most gourmands.', 'MJ Men is nice and smooth. This is another fragrance that is absolutely more suitable to those warmer weather days when subtly is all that is needed.', ""I have been brought up to a Mediterranean seaside place where the landscape is dominated by olive and fig trees that you can find in abundance as well as cypress which is used in order to separate people‚Äôs fields and mark the space with it's dark green presence in a vast landscape of green and silver that commences from the shores of the sea and climbs up to the mountains. The salty sea breeze blends with the aromas of the trees, the herbs and the flowers as they coexist in an incredible balance. I think that this perfume is the only one I have tried that is able to convey all these with such clarity as it manages to recreate in a totally three dimensional space this Mediterranean vibrant landscape and its wild but also balanced beauty. I recall my father and our endless walks at those fields where he used to define certain herbs or flowers, to tell stories about them or to reveal to me some of their secrets. I still remember our favorite place under the cypress where we used to gaze at a colorful sea of trees at the one side and the real one at the other and also swimming during the summer time. The salty fresh air and the intense aromas of the fig trees with the cypress in a superb coexistence is what I mostly detect at this perfume and this is the main reason that I adore it as it instantly places me to this landscape and awakes all those precious memories."", ""I am on my 2nd 125 ml bottle. This stuff is just heavenly. I prefer it over Diptyque's version. This is pretty much the perfect daytime spring/summer scent. Straight up figs and that's all good with me. One that women can easily pull off as well."", 'Love this fragrance. It may not be for every man unless they are in touch with their feminine side, but why let that bother you or even question it? How can some people not smell fig in this? Marc Jacobs + BVLGARI Eau Parfumee Au The Rouge together=FIG HEAVEN.', ""This stuff is kind of strange, and I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. It is indeed fig and coconut, and opens green and creamy, and not very sweet. The combination is very tropical and refreshing, but it shares some of the bug spray aspect that intrudes into my enjoyment of Tommy Bahama...just a slight chemical edge. It starts to get less green and more spicy after a few minutes, with a little bit of the rubber smell of brand new sneakers. The green foliage also starts to return, but this time it's musty and fetid, and no longer tantalizing. Fangorn forest, where the Ents live, probably smells like this. I like how the stuff never gets out of hand in terms of sweetness, but as it progresses it just gets too dirty and staid. By the end, there's a big component of soggy, rotten rubber from an old shoe, with the foliage of an office ficus trying to keep it pleasant. There are so many better fig fragrances that it's a bit of a waste of time in that arena, but it's not too bad overall."", ""Im surprised many are saying it has not longevity or projection. I get hours of this on my skin even after shower if I don't scrub off hard. It is very masculine as well while beach fresh and nightlife sexy. It is not feminine at all but possible worn by women. I get compliments of all ages and sexes. It becomes darker and creamier in warm weather and it becomes a rich sexy fresh magic scent in cold nights when out with the friends or ladies. This is a great fragrance that recall all at once a, woodsy forest like nature, with fresh sudsy soapy clean out of the shower feeling, rubbery-like fixing a flat tire on a new car in a new suit handsome gentlemen and a sunny beachy sexy island after a long tan on the sands and ready for the nightlife. take a deep whiff and imagine all that rolled into one."", ""A great creamy fig based scent. I wish it had a bit more projection power because it's a safe scent with a calmness to it. I had the chance to wear it for a majority of my summer, not yet for spring but I feel like it would be perfect for spring. Sweet fig, with a coconut scent to it, unique to my nose at least. Also, with 4.2 oz I spray this 5 times on me because of the weak projection and there's so much juice to be used."", 'I can imagine that some people like it but for me this is not a men fragrance. It smells too female/metro sexual and after one hour it smells boring as hell.', ""A mild sweet mixture of coconut, fig and clean watery notes with a very, very soft cedar background. While its mild and one might think the sillage and longevity are weak, they really are not. I thought so too initially, but Ive had people comment on it at the end of the day after I applied it in the morning. There is something about this one I like. Its perfect for an office environment or a lazy sunday afternoon. Its refined and not over powering. It may be slightly too sweet for some, but for a fruity sweet scent it def smells like a man's cologne, and not unisex at all. I applaud Marc Jacobs for making something totally unique in such an over crowded marketplace. Thumbs up."", 'I bought this one 10 years ago. Now I know why I never touched it again‚Ä¶ But the quality is very good. 5/10', 'Nice subtle scent with a great smell!', ""Smells great. Doesn't last long though.

It's a great scent if you just want something to wear and don't feel like wearing something strong."", 'I actually ended up buying this but took it back. Terrible longevity. It\'s not really even considered a ""soft"" scent to me. Just unfortunately a waste of money.', 'smelled every scent in sephora and ended up blown away smelling this on paper.', ""Tried this at the store today and wow does it ever smell awesome! As everyone else says, very creamy and it definitely has a coconut vibe but as it drys down you get a floral thing going on with the coconutty (figgy) vibe in the background. I love fig and coconut (I must have 4 or 5 frags with coconut as a note) and this does it in a way that is masculin and has absolutely no sweetness. Yes it only lasted 2-3 hours on me but that is ok as I would be happy to re apply this hourly just to smell that opening. Awesome stuff and I'll be getting it and dousing myself all summer ;)"", ""Marc Jacobs Men is soft, sweet and taps into something in me which I can't help but love. I like to think I'm into manly, dark, woody, peppery, spicy, incense etc... fragrances but give me something soft and playful like this and I revert to being a small child craving the sweet and comforting. Opening with a lovely fruity citrus and cardamom I was happy enough but then it reveals a fig based fragrance which is sweet and creamy probably due to the combination with Tonka bean. Fig is one of my favourite notes it would seem and I'd go as far as to say this is one of the best fig scents for men. (although it's very unisex) I have Fico di amalfi (soft, citrus fig) and love Philosykos (stark, green fig) but I don't think this is all that similar aside from it having fig as the centre piece. It's soft Like Fico but has a creamy coconut accord and gentle woods which set it apart in my opinion. Longevity is okay but not great and it doesn't really project all that much but smells great and the bottle is cool!"", 'A mellow yet rich presentation of the fig leaf with nuances of butter, coconut and an underlying musk that hints to the smell of skin several hours after the application of sun lotion, once it has been absorbed into the skin, leaving it toned and nicely conditioned by the sun. Suitably casual, yet elegant enough for the office, perfect for warm weather... (Tip: if you are into this kind of scent and you enjoy a traditional wet shave, it layers very well with Geo F. Trumpers Coconut shaving cream). The scent seems to pass quickly yet compliments still come many hours later in the day... A nice and easy tropical fig scent to wear in the hot months, perfect for BBQs, garden parties and/or beach vacations. Just add a suntan and a Mojito...

Why are there so many of these glutting up the market?"", ""Marc Jacobs for Men is a soft, thoughtful fragrance. It is comforting but still fashionable. It feels silky and a little buttery. It has a tropical essence but in general I think it's just very appealing and alluring. None of the notes are loud or bold in any way. I am very surprised to see people say that it is boring, because I think it was actually an edgy statement to release this as a masculine fragrance, especially a self-titled one.  Just to put it out there, the bottle is awful. It looks like a paperweight you'd find on the desk of a used car salesman during the late 80s. The bottle is very wide and flat with the atomizer placed directly in the center, which makes it awkward to press down with your finger while your hand is holding the bottle. It feels as though you could drop it easily. You may even have to use both hands with the larger size bottle, which is an absolutely glaring design flaw.  I greatly appreciate that Marc Jacobs for Men is relatively inexpensive compared to similar designer fragrances when you consider the price per ounce. Even though I love the way it smells, I will definitely pass on a purchase, because the projection is extremely soft, to a degree that's unacceptable for me. I say this completely without hyperbole: it has probably the worst sillage of any fragrance I've tried. My final verdict is that Marc Jacobs for Men is a wonderful scent with dreadful performance and a terrible bottle."", ""BEAUTIFUL! sprayed this on my wrist right now. and it just takes me to an island paradise. white sand and the blue ocean in front of me. eating macadamia nuts and got coconut juice on my right. no other person on my sight. just me and my perfect beach vacation. honestly i don't care about longevity or projection 'coz then i'll just spray more. besides this for me is a scent to be enjoyed by myself."", ""A great fragrance if you don't mind the fact that it smells like so many others in the genre. I'm wearing a sample right now and it reminds me very, very, much of Guerlain Homme, a bottle of which I own, and which also shares the same abyssmal longevity that other people have complained about here. If you have never smelled scents like Guerlain Homme or Prada Luna Rossa (which this also bears some semblence to), and you enjoy a pleasant, lime-infused, smooth, safe, rather generic, citrus affair, then perhaps this fragrance is for you. If you only wear unique, classic, amazing or attention grabbing scents, I'd pass on this one for something more a bit more... intriguing. Par for the course, yet pleasant: 7.5/10"", ""The initial smell is like cocunut and vanilla, some spices as well. Dry down is nice but it fades quickly.

Wont purchase ever again and this is my second bottle.', ""I agree with what's been said: a really lovely, powdery blend of fig and coconut with neither note dominating the other. It smells wonderful but has horrendous longevity and next to no projection. If it wasn't so pricey, I'd suggest it more as a body spray than a fragrance.

Opening with a lovely fruity citrus and cardamom I was happy enough but then it reveals a fig based fragrance which is sweet and creamy probably due to the combination with Tonka bean. Fig is one of my favourite notes it would seem and I'd go as far as to say this is one of the best fig scents for men. (although it's very unisex) I have Fico di amalfi (soft, citrus fig) and love Philosykos (stark, green fig) but I don't think this is all that similar aside from it having fig as the centre piece. It's soft Like Fico but has a creamy coconut accord and gentle woods which set it apart in my opinion.

I had an image of drifting on a canoe and then drinking an unsweetened green juice at a spa. The dry down felt a bit woody but what predominated was a standard-ish lavender note.

What I can say with confidence is that Bora Bora is inexpensive and reasonably pleasant, which are basically the only criteria you need for casual wear. I've found myself wearing this one to work, and even though I have to douse myself in it to make it through the day and even though the kiwi note is pretty much the only thing that's specifically discernable, I enjoy smelling it on myself and I've received compliments from the folks around me (co-workers, customers, and even an Uber driver) while wearing it.

A bit of leather but very subtle (you have to look for it). I\'d consider it Curve with depth/character. Not as sporty but still playful. Not ground breaking, so if you have Curve you might not need it. Just my 2. I thought it was going to be strong.. wood or musk heavy.. old man smell. Not the case to my nose. Its not fruity sweet, but fresh with a bit of sweetness.. like Curve. If Curve is what you spray before class.. this is what you spray before the spring dance. Longevity is ok, not the greatest but projection is really good for the first hour or so. Then it dies down but it still has good trails. Its fairly smooth with a little synthetic vibe going on.. but not bad. I get a clean and fresh ""2000\'s"" style of sporty spray, that has the DNA to appeal to young people. Kinda generic for 2019, but what smells good, smells good. And this smells good to my nose. Any age can wear this, but late 30\'s plus might want something more ""mature"". Spring summer for sure.. day to night leaning towards day. Cant knock it really. $12.99 at Burlington for 3.4 was a pretty good grab. Especially since I have nothing with this DNA any more. Overall.. good juice.', ""Being a huge fan of Claiborne scents, I've always wanted 'Bora Bora' for many years now. If you are a fan of 'Curve' and 'Mambo', you will immediately recognize the drydown of this to be extremely similar. Initial blast is kiwi, ginger, fruit and what seems to be a tea note. Right as I sprayed this my girlfriend immediately complimented me and said 'wow that smells wonderful'. So it definitely did its job there.  It projects really well and a bit of a spicy musk undertone begins to develop as it dries down. I would like to call it the 'Claiborne' musk note, and those familiar with the brand will know what I am talking about. This comes out about an hour after spraying, and smells fantastic.  It is clean without being 'sport' or 'fresh' scented, and masculine without being dirty or dusty. Most of the kiwi and fruity hibiscus notes fade away about an hour in and this is where this fragrance shines. It is a ginger and spice blend layered in musk and amber that is simply amazing and grabs compliments easily.  With a liberal application of a ten sprays (neck, shoulders, wrists and chest), I am getting 7-10+ hours of longevity, with about 24-36+ hours on clothes and fabrics.  Projection is really good for the first four hours, and sillage is solid without being offensive or cloying. After five or six hours, it stays closer to the skin but lingers for another couple hours or so and smells very natural. This stuff lasts longer than most new fragrances that cost three times as much. For an Eau de Cologne concentration, Claiborne always makes fragrances that perform better than most EDT's, and 'Bora Bora' is no exception. It performs and projects quite well, even in warm weather and humid climates. And for the price, you really can't go wrong here. It's great for spring and summer days, nights out on the town, date nights and safe for office environments and professional events. I really love this scent, and if you're a fan of 'Curve', 'Mambo', 'Claiborne Sport' and others like it, you will undoubtedly enjoy 'Bora Bora'. For the price it commands, you could easily blind buy this and enjoy it. Highly recommended."", 'Smells like straw plus hairspray. Unpleasant. Reminds of Curve Crush when first applied, but Crush smells good after the dry down. Update: Like it when limited to 2-3 sprays. Fresh and clean.', 'This is a fairly linear fragrance - same top notes as drydown. Smells clean and soapy and slightly citrusy. Similar vibe as A&F Fierce. Masculine, no-nonsense, high-heat, summer fragrance. Very affordable, too, Definitely recommend.', ""Bora Bora is surprisingly good for how cheap and synthetic it is. It starts out with a tart kiwi note dominating it as well as leather in the background with some nice citrus notes. It does smell quite tropical but not in same way that aquatic fragrances smell tropical. It lasts a decent amount of time, I've actually gotten quite a few compliments on it over the years, and for $15 for 3.4 oz why the hell not? To top it all off I don't have anything in my collection that smells quite like it. A cheap and cheerful, likeable fragrance. Great for summer and outdoor use. This is one of the first fragrances I ever bought and I'm still reaching for it years later."", ""Hmm. Well, if you love the smell of dryer sheets, and really who doesn't I guess, then you'll love Bora Bora."", 'My signature for over a decade... I\'ve always gotten tons of compliments on this scent everywhere I go. Over a decade, and still, I always come back to it. Nothing I have ever smelled smells quite like this does. It\'s leathery, sweet, savory and woody. It\'s realistically sweet, like smelling dry cane sugar, not overly sweet like many modern scents, and the leather smells quite realistic as well. The hibiscus is more prominent than the votes here give it credit for, and it ties everything together like the iris in Dior Homme. Unfortunately, it\'s been through 2 memorable reformulations: *The original version (gold cap and neck, gold sprayer, gold ""Claiborne\'s"" around the logo) was very figgy, dark, and EXTREMELY strong. Unforgiving, and potent, like an Eau de Parfum. Surprisingly, as of 06-2020 (18 years later) it can still be found on eBay, although who knows how it\'s faired. *The first reformulation (I think around 2006-2007? Black cap and neck, black ""Claiborne\'s"" around the logo, gold overshell sprayer) tamed the figgy overtones, and it became an easier to wear, more crowd pleasing scent, which is where this remained for the next 8 years. I think there was also a slight reformulation midway through this 8 year stretch, when the sprayer nozzle went from being black to being white (but still a gold metal overshell sprayer) and that was mostly unnoticeable, besides losing an hour off the then current 10hrs of longevity - so, not really a problem.  *The 2nd major reformulation (Somewhere in late 2014 or early 2015? Bottles with white plastic sprayers, black caps and necks with no ""Claiborne"" markings around the Bora Bora logo) is the absolute worst. The smell has remained the same, but it just doesn\'t last like it used to. Newer reviews cite no problems with longevity though, so YMMV with newer bottles than the 2016 bottle I sampled. After being let down by the 2016 bottle, I went searching on eBay and purchased 3 bottles of the first reformulation of Bora Bora from a 2013 batch (3CA1 batch codes), so I\'ll at least have my favorite scent for a few more years.  Bora Bora Exotic faired far better through this last round of reformulations, and lasts much longer than my 2016 bottle of Bora Bora, but it\'s a completely different scent. Bora Bora Exotic can be described as a more modern Dior Fahrenheit clone, similar to Fahrenheit Aqua. Give it a try as well, if you haven\'t already! (It\'s my favorite Dior Fahrenheit alternative). If you\'re a fan of this scent and sad about the reformulation, try Jay Z Gold, which smells like a blueberry YSL L\'Homme flanker. When I run out of this, Jay Z Gold will likely take its place. A higher quality/longer lasting replacement suggestion would be Dior Homme Eau for Men. If you like this, you\'ll probably love that too!', 'Once again the reviews here have me intrigued enough to risk a blind buy of a fragrance! I was a fan of Claiborne for men and the 1st Curve,I think Bora Bora may yet be another hit by L.C.!', 'This is a nice warm-weather fragrance. I agree with Ray Achnioach that it is a tropical scent without beating you over the head about it. The fruit and leather dominate up front, but the lavender and hibiscus are most prominent on the drydown. It must be the strength of the non-tropical leather notes next to the typical fruit and floral notes that give it its unique profile. I am wearing it at work today, but I think this is better suited to summer parties and get-togethers than around the office.', ""I need to use more-a, more-a, of Bora Bora. It's easy to like this fragrance. The kiwi, lemon and bergamot smells great and the floral mids dry down nicely into a refreshing, soapy smell. I could care less if this is a synthetic cheapo. It smells really nice and like any fragrance, fits certain occasions. I have this in my collection alongside some very expensive bottles. I don't wear Creed to beat around town and I don't wear Bora Bora when I'm out to dinner with my wife. If you like to have a few pleasant smelling fragrances around that you can spray liberally then buy Bora Bora. If your nose is so discerning that you can only stomach niche than a) don't buy Bora Bora and b) get over yourself."", ""Another selection from the back of my cabinet. I purchased this a few years back probably at Ross or TJ Max. For some reason it's gone unused. So tonight I gave it a tryout. The bottle is a lovely design which is tropical themed but not in a tacky manner. Spray some on my neck and chest, dry down and the frangrance blossoms. Very nice! Bora Bora sounds exotic so I guess that's where the Kiwi comes in. Without that knowledge I would say that this fragrance is a sweet, tangy (Kiwi?), lemony fragrance liberally enhanced by a nice musk and a unobtrusive hint of leather. While not listed it semms to have some aldehyde to it also. There is some floral essence but not much to be noticed. A bit of cedar gives the fragrance some depth. This is surprisingly nice. Not at all a formal scent and while masculine not an assertive alpha male scent. It could be a very friendly, laid back, chilling out alpha male scent. I could see wearing this with a Hawiian shirt, straw hat and comfortable white slacks while enjoying a tropical adult beverage and a fine Avo cigar. The name is very fitting. It's summer and I'll happily be wearing this on occasion."", ""This one is basiclly a spin off of the Curve series. A silent flanker if you will. Bora Bora is slightly more unorthodox in it's entire presentation than original Curve, making it the better scent by comparison in my eyes. It's a crowd pleaser, and like almost all Liz Claiborne Curve fragrances women like them. Bora Bora is no exception to that rule as I've received several compliments from ladies who were lucky enough to waft through my synthetic olfactory cloud. Bora Bora is what I choose to wear in the summer time when I roll the car windows down with the 4 year old in the back seat, as I crank Level 42's ‚ÄúSomething About You‚Äù while knocking around town running errands on a Thursday afternoon. Good times indeed."", 'Ever since Bora Bora was released in 2002, that silly, dark, porcelain-looking bottle has always fascinated me. First thing I notice is that tart kiwi/ lime smell, which isn‚Äôt sweet. (I am fascinated with the smell of unsweetened fruit, for some reason.) After awhile, a fig and ginger drydown becomes apparent. I think this powdery (not baby powder, but spice powder) drydown is very original, and makes Bora Bora special. UPDATE: I don‚Äôt know if there has been a reformulation or not through the years, but I bought a bottle online and that fig and ginger drydown simply wasn‚Äôt there. So I don‚Äôt know if it was reformulated or watered down. But thankfully, I still have my vintage mini.', ""I scooped this up as a blind buy at TJ Maxx for $15 or so. Even though I mostly buy designer brand juices, I do enjoy Liz Claiborne's Curve's for men line. They are cheap and the quality is decent so I figured this would be too. Indeed, the quality of Bora Bora is good. I'm not super sold on the scent though. I will be the first to admit I don't have the greatest nose but Bora Bora to me smells like Irish Spring soap. Honest to god, thats all I can think of when I wear this. Bora Bora is a safe unoffensive scent and good for your gym bag or glove box. I can mostly see myself rockin' Bora Bora on quick trips to the grocery store or that unexpected errand I have to run after the gym and need to freshen up. Overall: 7/10  If you have an xtra $10-15 kickin' around and want to explore, its worth a blind buy."", 'Very under-rated fragrance. I got it as an Eid Gift from a cousin. I did not even know that a perfume named Bora Bora existed :P I saw it and thought it is a local cologne not a branded one :P at the first sniff it reminded me of Cool water a bit i thought it wont last at all...I tried it last night and it turned out to be quite long lasting. I would wear it at day times mostly as a daily use cologne.  A GIFT IS A GIFT...WHO CARES :D', ""Just your typical boring men's cologne. I don't know why I even bothered. It was dirt cheap at ross so I figured why not. It would make a nice bathroom spray or something I wear when I dont want to wear my good stuff."", 'Boring-Boring from Claiborne 15.00 at Ross Glovebox scent for sweaty days Not for a date  Has no originality', ""complete synthetic crap but wait a few minutes after you sprayed it on and you will find it fresh, joyfull and nice for casual wearing (if you're in your 20s or younger - which i'm not so for me a no-go!)...it's not pretentious it's just what it is...a nice fresh kiwi scent for the young ones ! (so i gave it to my son)"", ""A very good and underrated fragrance from Liz Claiborne. Perhaps this designer's longest-lasting cologne, since it easily lasts the whole day on me. Lots of citrus and tropical fruits in the top notes while maintaining its masculinity. Soapy and clean in the middle notes, while woods, light musk, and leather round out the base notes. I've got lots of compliments while wearing this scent. A little bit goes a long way (as this is a sillage monster), so I recommend three sprays maximum. This is a cheapy but goodie that I'm happy to keep in my collection."", ""Bora Bora is a pedestrian but pleasant fruity fragrance. It makes me feel nice and clean. There is a sweetness to it that comes from the kiwi, but it's blended with the citrus notes. It opens with a fresh burst, then becomes sweet and piquant. When it settles, it's a soft, enjoyable perfume that the majority of female sales associates like to recommend to me. Although I like sweet and fruity scents, this one doesn't do it for me."", ""My favorite from the Liz Claiborne line. This is aromatic, fresh, green, floral, sweet. It's great for summer time. Got me compliments when I use to wear it. Try it."", ""There is only one thing that pop's up. Erotica...  Well, maybe other things too as a direct consequence. But I imagine that's perfectly allowed in Bora Bora. Now buy a bottle plus a flight ticket and prepare for total bliss."", ""i'm not the biggest fan of this, but whenever i wear it, i get compliments, so it must smell great to everyone around me."", 'smell really good on blotter, not so good on my skin. last is poor. In blotter paper reminds me to any sport colognes for men.', 'CHEAP AND CHEERFUL A common business niche strategy is to be ""cheap and cheerful."" The idea is to offer a reasonable level of amenities at an exceptionally low price. The problem is that often the amenities are so low, especially for experience goods, that even at a cheap price the product does not deliver much in the way of value. In my opinion many Dana products fall into this category. They\'re extremely inexpensive but the quality is so bad that the tradeoff is not worth it. In my view, Bora Bora is cheap and cheerful done right. The price point is really low--I got a 3.3oz bottle for around $13 at Marshalls. I\'ve seen similar prices online. Unlike the Dana products, the quality delivered is really quite good. While this is definitely not a love scent, it falls squarely in the like category.  The mystery is Liz Claiborne\'s strategy in terms of their products. As others have noted, Bora Bora smells similar to Curve, Claiborne\'s flagship line. If anything, I think Bora Bora is more interesting and better than Curve. Yet Curve products sell at a higher price point--the low to mid 20s for a 3.3oz bottle. Viewed in that light, I think the value is really exceptional. If you like Curve, you\'ll love Bora Bora and the extra money in your pocket. On to the details of the fragrance itself: If I were to describe the Bora Bora ""experience"" in one word, that would be it. Bora Bora is a pleasant fragrance. The opening, the middle, and the ending are all pleasant. They\'re not spectacular or likely to evoke strong positive or negative feelings, just safe and pleasant.  The opening consists of citrus, but tamed by kiwi and lavender. It\'s not a sharp acidic opening, rather it is mild, somewhat refreshing and, most of all, pleasant. In the middle, the citrus fades off, leaving a kind of soapy feeling with the florals and the ever-present kiwi. The drydown is mainly cedar with a touch of musk to give it a little more gravitas. Again, it too is pleasant.  There\'s nothing to rave about here: No sublime accords with unexpected combinations of scents. No unexpected or jarring transitions. No annoyance from over or underpowered scent. Everything is nice and safe.  This is not to say that this is a bad thing. Bora Bora is well crafted and comfy, like a fuzzy pair of slippers. Sometimes comfort is all anyone wants. Some mornings I get up and am happy to be surrounded with warm, safe, comfortable scents. I don\'t want or need to always be challenged or distracted by complex accords or transitions. Bora Bora is perfect for those days.  In terms of value for money, Bora Bora delivers. I got a 100ml bottle for just $15. Now, if this were all I had in my wardrobe, it wouldn\'t be enough, but there is a time and a place for all things, including pleasant, inexpensive fragrances that epitomize relaxation and comfort.  Some comparisons at a similar price point are useful. Nautica Blue can be had at this price, but it is a vastly worse scent-sharp at the opening and non-existent in the drydown. Curve and Curve Soul can also be had for this price, but I think Bora Bora is more interesting and nicer in the drydown. Of course, there are many others as well. My point is that, so long as you have the right expectations, Bora Bora offers a good, solid likable scent for not much money.  Recommendation: If you\'re looking for a ""fuzzy slippers"" type of fragrance and don\'t want to spend a lot, it\'s an excellent blind buy.', 'I dont understand how anyone could NOT like this one. less that 20 bucks at marshalls, last 4 to 8 hours (on me), and smells good. so far my one of my favorites from claiborne.', ""Definteley Liz Claiborne is the best choice for low priced fragrances, great variety, nice colognes, sillage and longevity.

The fresh citruses are not pungent or biting because the kiwi gives it just enough of a tropical feel without smelling like a cocnut drink with an umbrella in it.

Ps: it doesn't smell like foot odor, but each nose has its own perception."", ""A beautiful fragrance that radiates lightness, joy, but also strength. Oh Paris Elysees, may it be eternal, limited edition in name only, because we have an aromatic with a personality that will easily be one of our most praised perfumes ever for any occasion and mood. Spray it on and see how instigating and seductive it is. Despite being a fresh and aromatic perfume, it has a certain weight to its base that you will easily notice and like. I don't usually reveal its name when people ask, it's a secret of mine. Hehehehe... I can't do without it, and if you don't know it, try it!"", ""I don't think it's reminiscent of quasar, but it's very reminiscent of creed green irish tweed and especially cool water... I really like this style of perfume and getting to know it was a great experience.  It's very herbal and tart, at least the way it feels on my skin... it's a much better perfume than Quasar and to think that it's sold in a pharmacy for around R$50 is very CHEAP. The perfume has quality!  Fixation and projection are ok, around 7 hrs of fixation with a projection of 1:30hr."", ""Simply a trip back in time to the 90s. What a perfume, ladies and gentlemen. It doesn't have a hint of sweetness, it's all those braaabo aromatics, it was literally love at first spray kkk. It stayed on my skin for 6~7 hours, projecting very well for 1h30.  In my opinion, it goes on for all occasions, office, college, bar, or even a trip to the corner bakery kkkk.  The only thing I'd like to point out is that, at least with me, in the cold it fades a lot, while on warmer days it shows up well, but I believe the perfume has a more intimate feel. For people who, like me, are passionate about the classics of the 90s, it's a real treat. Music: Metallica - The Unforgiven."", ""I can't say that it's similar to the Creed perfume, as I've only heard of that one, but I know Cool Water and this Vodka Limited Edition is very reminiscent of the Davidoff perfume. A scent of presence, of personality, fresh but at the same time intimate. Even if the performance isn't vigorous, I like it because it makes me feel uncomfortable to smell the same thing for a long time. Sensational price. It's worth getting to know in some way.  Aroma 9 Performance 7"", ""And to me, the smell reminds me of some kind of shaving foam from the '90s. It's a nice smell, I don't know what it's like, but I like it. It has an echo of early 90's perfumery. P.S. I will complete the review: Yes, it really has a similarity with Creed Irish Tweed. And quite similar."", ""I don't know Cool Water or Ladro, but if it's anything like Quasar then I'm sure Vodka is better, at least to me it doesn't smell like the traditional Quasar. Cedar, geranium, lavender and coriander dominate this piece. In my opinion, it's the most natural of the Paris Elysees - which always tend to sound too synthetic - and therefore the best I've tasted so far. When it comes out I feel an intense sweetness, sometimes it reminds me of grape or wine, I could be wrong but that's what it reminds me of. And that smell lingers for a long time, almost until the end. Excellent projection and hold!""]"
