Definitely not a safe blind buy. I actually feel sick smelling this - it smells dusty, musty and feels suffocating. Maybe it is the patchouli but I genuinely feel like I can‚Äôt catch a breath.  I am obsessed with the idea - it is definitely an evocative scent‚Ä¶ wearable though?‚Ä¶ not for me üíî', 'It is definitely an unusual fragrance. A hyperrealistic sweet incense ""walking inside a catholic church"" scent. Love the idea but unfortunately feel suffocated by it. Made me willing to try others in the series though.', ""Cannot believe how overhyped this one is. This is one of the few I have actually scrubbed off. Maybe it would have improved but I honestly couldn't get past the opening. It has a sickly sweet aroma off the top. Everyone was saying church incense, so that's what I was expecting, but it just didn't come through for me."", ""Just got this in. I get a very strong fizzy sweet ginger ale smell from this. Like a Canada Dry, not a Schwepp's. It's kind of all I'm getting. It's not unpleasant, just not what I was expecting. Fresh and cool and effervescent rather than damp and gothic and churchy. Hmmn. Curious."", 'If you\'re at all familiar with the actual resins and woods that constitute incense, you will smell that this is totally a frankincense scent. Whatever the ""incense"" note means to you, it is not a generically ""smoky"" potpourri. It\'s almost like how clementine, orange, sweet candy lemon and fresh sour lemon can all be gathered under a ""citrus"" note. Not trying to seem smart, it\'s just that incense could be anything from a general smokey note like cigarette, a fireplace, coal, or be more cool, more warm and sweet, or like any scented incense sticks. This is frankincense without being smoked. If you run a bit of the resin on your hand to warm it up you sense this subtle almost sweetly minty smell. No smoke in this perfume. It starts like a light and fizzy raw frankincense with maybe a bit of cool myrrh, almost imagine a carbonated sweet 7up, dries down warmer a bit pissy and intimate and softly herbal like sweet chamomile tea.  Yes it\'s reminiscent of church but the raw incense. Not when it\'s burnt. Cool scent, I don\'t see any resemblance to Liturgie heures, that one is dominantly woody, though also cool.  I like this the same way I like frankincense in general. Non offensive but not generic at all.', 'My Modus Operandi is rather unusual when it comes to sampling new fragrances. In every batch of samples that i acquire, obviously there are some fragrances im more interested in then the others. I always leave the ones im most curious about last, with the final one being the most ‚Äúimportant‚Äù to me. Because of this, sometimes i end up setting them aside for weeks or even months. A sort of self-hyping aswell as delayed gratification.  Being drawn to church related art aswell as incense scents, Commes de Garcon‚Äôs Avignon was on my ‚ÄúTry list‚Äù for a long time and i had the sample set aside for nearly 2 months now, its the very last one out of the bunch. At one point i realised that incense and olibanum (frankincense) isn‚Äôt exactly the same thing, not always atleast. Incense is a broader term, its an accord that can be done in many ways just like musk or citruses can be. It can be ambery, ashy, smokey, woody, etc. I prefer the scent of olibanum with its dusty, sticky resinous facets and thats exactly what we get in Avignon.  Avignon didn‚Äôt dissapoint in its realistic, authentic use of olibanum. Its a fragrance that provides great fidelity to the artistic direction, and thats where the story takes a twist i didn‚Äôt expect. I always thought that the more realistic the olibanum is, the more i would love it and Avignon prooved that wrong. The fragrance isn‚Äôt thin by any means, Its just too...raw...too naked to me. It starts off light but as soon as it moves into the mid and drydown it blooms into unadultered, dry and dusty olibanum. Its the scent of the unlit resins themselfs, just concentrated. It smells almost ‚Äústale‚Äù, the same way old church pews smell like. If frankincense was a flower, this fragrance would be a soliflore and if it was food, it would be a gourmand. When it comes to olibanum based perfumes, my mind keeps wandering back to Armani Prive Sable Nuit which captured my heart. Sable Nuit is more dressed up and its softened by vanilla, cedar and benzoin. Its a more subtle olibanum fragrance that still emphasizes the note, yet manages to create a calming, meditative and more complex scent. The only problem is that its alot more expensive then Avignon and equally hard to find in my country.  Avignon also made me understand Filippo Sorcinelli‚Äôs Reliqvia better, see the olibanum more clearly in that composition. It turned out to be an educational scent and im thankfull for the opportunity to experience it because it will be a reference perfume for me from now on. If you are looking for a definitive church resin perfume then you are in the right place.', 'Devout, slightly pissy cathedral resins. Bone dry incense. Gets oddly animalic in the summertime? The midday bells are ringing. A draft flows in through that there cross of the confessional screen...', 'At first I really disliked this and thought it smelled of a very particular character. That was until the smoky chamomile tea scent came through and saved it.', ""Invigoratingly cool stone walls of a medieval catholic church on a hot summer's day, the incense has infused into the tapestries over the centuries. A new stick is lit and the smoke swirls towards the heavens, mesmerizing against the beam of light from the rose windows. Somewhere outside, yellow flowers bloom.  This is absolutely beautiful, intimate and inviting you to meditation, to slow down and just be for a while. I pined after this for years and finally bought it blindly, and I was not disappointed. It's a cold incense, sort of dry, meditative. There's not sweetness so do not expect that. Also no patchouli, thankfully."", 'I had Avignon all wrong. Having read descriptions of a ""gothic, churchy"" incense, I was surprised by the lack of smoke and how strongly the resins and yellow florals make themselves known. This is a measured, studied incense. It took a theology class too young. I can\'t smell the patchouli without potentially making shit up, but I can detect earthy base notes which soften and contextualize the three wise men of it all. Development over time is beautiful. Also, the atomizers for the incense series are really good. Don\'t buy decants of these, just lowball people on Mercari until you hit the jackpot.', 'Pretty awesome. Opens as if its a cedar frag. A sharp cedar, almost lemony tart. Oakmoss and patchouli are very forward on the open as well. Very fresh and airy opening while being weighty(its always the contrast that we appreciate in art). After about 15mins, you really start to smell the incense. This is 100% Catholic church incense. Transports you to Mass. But still a light and airy perfumey way. The myrrh and frankincense smell real.  Anyhow - its amazing. Smells awesome and worth its 4.3+ rating. The only drawback is the performance. Its important to note--- This thing is beast-mode for longevity on SKIN. Normally, things last long on clothes and not so much on skin for me. But this was detectable on my hand after 13 hrs. Sillage/Projection are a different story. Both are extremely poor. It doesnt last long on clothes either. Despite the mixed performance -- its a 9.5/10. Just bring a decant and spray an ml every 2 hrs.', ""love love love it. but she is not for everyone! i grew up catholic, attended mass every friday. smells exactly like mass- it's amazing. my only complaint is how intimate the sillage is; but maybe that's a good thing bc im seeing some of yall hate this. tbh, id be an absolute menace if the sillage was heavier. avignon will definitely be in my personal rotation."", ""This scent brings back a recollection of Sunday mass during my childhood in Poland. Crisp cold air, mumbled singing of a solemn hymn, smoky vapours leaking down from golden incense holders, shuffling steps across worn-down tiles, S's and Z's breaking away from whispered prayers, reflecting off of stained glass images of saints and lambs to arrive as a shivvering breath in my ears.  The scent is totally inseperable from roman catholic mass. This can't be a scent that smells like 'you' to others, that you can make 'your' scent. It will always be you smelling like church."", 'I hate to be so ooverly critical, but i bought a 5 ml sample of this and was excited to try it. Tested it out the same day it arrived and my only honest reaction was it was flat out gross. It smelled like an old used book store. You know the kind of dank and mildewy smell. I even had my daughter smell it without saying anything to her what i thought, and her first words were ‚Äúit smells like mildew‚Äù. Even after dry down it never took on a pleasant or even tolerable scent.  I won‚Äôt even give it away because i would feel bad having someone else have to smell that way. No clue how people gave it good reviews TBH. Just don‚Äôt get it.', 'Soo vivid esp in the dry down, of church incense. My husband (not religious just a huge fan of Church Smell) said it feels sacrilegious to replicate this so identically. Love taking a whiff of this, but I join in everyone that would never wear this purely bc of association to Church lol.', ""It does remind me of Tuesdsy Catholic mass (yep, if your family was a practicing Catholic family at my school then you got to enjoy Catholic mass twice a week!) in parochial school if I close my eyes and concentrate hard enough. It's Catholic mass, but watered down and diluted to make it more approachable for the masses. It's right on the edge of being what one thinks of when talking about Catholic liturgical incense, but it just is not quite there. I thought from the reviews that I was going to smell this and be transported to the first time I ever step foot in a Catholic Church. Which kind of, but not really. This is not nearly strong enough to be considered truly Roman Catholic incense. Not to me anyway. It smells pretty watered down if that makes any sense. I like it, but probably will not be getting a full bottle because it just does not have that oomph I am looking for."", '#1221 in my ""Tour de Fragrance"" Got this as a decant. I don\'t blind buy anything over $100. When I see olibanum, myrrh and incense as notes in a scent named ""Series 3: Incense"" I expect some serious incense. I really don\'t get that here. Yesterday I wore Moresque ""Aurum."" That myrrh note wears combat boots! This fragrance is incense for beginners with no experience with incense, because if you\'d experienced any truly incense-forward scents, you\'d find this very weak by comparison. Not ""churchy"" in any cathedral or temple I\'ve been in, unless they have a special mild incense for the childcare area.  Nearly every scent that uses this ""everything and the kitchen sink"" approach (15 notes employed here) you get something pleasant but very non-descript and underperforming. The only exception I\'ve found is Penhaligon\'s ""Sartorial"" with 24 notes. I\'m confident I could pick it out from Nabeel\'s ""Master Perfumer Series"" like ""Al Bashiq"", which employs 44 notes. It\'s almost universally a mistake to formulate a scent that way. Can anyone actually distinguish one Jacques Bogart ""Silver Scent"" from the others? This Comme des Garcons scent comes across to me like that. Doesn\'t take a master perfumer to dump in everything you have on the shelf.  This is certainly safe for any use because it\'s simply not that potent, and it\'s pleasant, but makes no lasting impression. It\'s a non-performer that fades away before lunch, doesn\'t draw any notice or compliments, and at $120 that\'s disappointing. Won\'t be a bottle buy for me.', 'The reviews are unanimous: this smells exactly like going to Mass. Never having been to Mass myself, I don‚Äôt have all the feelings Catholics (and ex-Catholics) seem to have about this: it‚Äôs not triggering or nostalgic or sacreligious to me. But YMMV. The opening is an incredibly unfriendly, dry and lemony, frankincense. It‚Äôs dusty. It‚Äôs not exactly pleasant. It‚Äôs pure and austere. It mellows in the drydown quite a bit and starts to smell more like a typical ‚Äúincense perfume‚Äù. I imagine that‚Äôs the myrrh and labdanum. But you can still smell the lemony-dusty top note, plus a somewhat ‚Äúmedicinal dried herbs‚Äù smell from the chamomile. I like the style of perfume this is ‚Äî it‚Äôs a modern (post-90‚Äôs, I think) niche phenomenon, to make a perfume that smells like one thing, very vividly, and just a hair too intense or offbeat to be merely pleasant, while still being a thing a human *can* enjoy wearing. The ‚ÄúFuck Yeah‚Äù school of perfumery; like ‚Äúfuck yeah, bitter leather‚Äù or ‚Äúfuck yeah, campfire smoke‚Äù or ‚Äúfuck yeah, oud‚Äù. It‚Äôs not really ‚Äúone note‚Äù but it is thematic; kind of the way Borodin or Mussorgsky would do something musical *with* a folk theme but it‚Äôs still very legibly what it is. Avignon is ‚Äúfuck yeah, lemony/dry incense‚Äù. And that‚Äôs not, I think, a smell I‚Äôm crazy about; I like a lot of incense types but not especially this one; but I like the clarity of it. Bertrand Duchafour is the ‚Äúunfriendly incense‚Äù king; he‚Äôs also responsible for austere, smoky/dusty things like Timbuktu and Copal Azur. I tend to like my dark/bitter perfumes with a little more warmth and richness for balance ‚Äî the way a good Scotch is never outright sweet but is a bit mellow ‚Äî but if you struggle to find incense that‚Äôs heartless enough for you, try Avignon.', 'Why is no one mentioning the overwhelming balsamic note that persists? To my nose, this is eau de pine-sol. The heavy camphorous onslaught overwhelms any notes that might balance this out. Is there incense...maybe;maybe not? Hard to isolate anything other than balsam for me. After about 3-4 hours, I detect a faint sweetness under the balsam, but it struggles to reveal any character. The longevity is great, but who wants to smell like a Christmas tree all day?', ""After searching high and low for a true-to-life ecclesial incense fragrance, I thought Avignon would be the end of my quest. Unfortunately, the only thing I‚Äôm searching for now is the exit from the room this scent occupies. It smells like the mingled perfume of a hundred grandmothers at a funeral reception‚Äîheld down the hall, past the bathrooms‚Äîfrom a chapel that might have used incense about a month ago. Despite all the hype, this was a major letdown. It opens with a sharp, perfumey blast: aldehydic, synthetic, and overwhelming. There‚Äôs none of the deep resin, sacred smoke, or quiet atmosphere I associate with real liturgical incense. I spend a lot of time around actual church incense and wooden pews, and this doesn‚Äôt come close. Instead, it‚Äôs loud, artificial, and oddly floral, with none of the reverence or stillness I was hoping for. In the end, it smells less like incense and more like Grandma Mildred‚Äôs dry-clean-only church outfit after it's absorbed a few years of cheap floral fragrances‚Äîmusty, cloying, and long past its prime. Deeply disappointing."", ""derby2169 spot on. The smell of a cavernous Catholic church an hour after Mass on a cool, bright summer's day. It smells airy and cool, the incense is gentle, blending into resinous beeswax polish on wood, and a hint of leather kneelers. Meditative."", 'I like it more than Kyoto. A woody version of dried tangerine peel? It‚Äôs sour with a hint of animalic notes, and the woody scent is very prominent. It reminds me of the scent in an old church. The animalic notes become even more noticeable in the dry-down, possibly due to the frankincense.', 'pure church incense', ""Pinnacle incense smoke condensed off of cold marble Arguably the best incense/olibanum note ever created. The perfect amount of smoke, tartness and resinous density. There is something particularly divine about Avignon that is hard to describe, on one hand very similar to the Jovoy incense offering and Cardinal, but simply better, truer in terms of balance and proportion. Not the most naturalistic or high quality, rather perfectly manipulated to create more so the experience of smelling frankincense smoke.  While it definitely encapsulates the smell of a catholic church, it doesn't remind me of mass as much as the smell of a church several hours after mass, perhaps on a cool afternoon, where the smoke has slowly condensed, almost like an imaginary icy distillate forming on cold marble pillars.  Very meditative and otherworldly, on the other hand, possibly off putting when smelt on a human, austere and highly introverted, cosmic almost.  On my skin it has a curious effect of emerging a few minutes after spraying. I dont know if it is a matter of the perfume oil heating up, but I get the most robust performance about 1-3 hours in. Before that it feels shy and after that more so intimate, although surprisingly long lasting."", 'Don‚Äôt need to really add to the reviews that say this smells like a church - it obviously does. For me, the sweet waxy almost sickly note is what sold it. This is gilded Catholicism. I was between this and Zagorsk and to me, Zagorsk is a very realistic church scent too but it‚Äôs less in your face - it‚Äôs more green and peppery and doesn‚Äôt quite have the headiness of Avignon.', ""Well I tested it out and yeah it smells like a church where they've been burning incense (frankincense) on coals and I think it's good. Now I'll say I much prefer the smell of melted frankincense (like lower temperatures so no burning just melting) but in truth this is also a good way to do it. I terms of occasions you might want to wear this is cold weather or for formal occasions such as church or an event, but this isn't mass appealing and will mostly be interesting to people I think. Now I considered buying this but the price is way to high (90 euros for 50ml for reference that's like 180 euros for 100ml which is far more than what most would be comfortable paying), and frankly I'm not willing to spend as much per milliliter no matter the smell or the house. I think there's other alternative's where you can also get good frankincense fragrances I haven't found them yet I'm still searching for that distinct melted frankincense smell."", ""Avignon captures an exact moment in time. It is the last whiff of church incense, one second before smoke and resin is snuffed out of existence. The crumbling coldness of ancient cathedral stone juxtaposed against the warmth of scared vapors. This captures light and dark, and is seductive in a way that feels like taking a lover in a darkened crypt during Catholic mass. I detect some cirtusy Frankincense in here, stacked on some beautiful beautiful resins. The combination of smoky powder and dense, gummy rocks of resin makes this one of the most gorgeous photorealistic incense perfumes I've ever set my nose on. I understand why this is the reference incense for so many- it's sacred and sensual, and absolute perfection. Need a full bottle. UPDATE: I got the full bottle. 10/10"", 'Creepy.', 'polish catholic church, love it', 'Cold, mysterious, thick scent. It lasts a very long time. In my opinion it doesn‚Äôt have the citrusy quality of burning frankincense resin. Nevertheless, it is quite churchy. A sophisticated incense, not a new age joss stick. Truly unisex. Not gimmicky. Can‚Äôt imagine wearing it with anything but total black.', ""Definitely best incense fragrance i have ever smelled. Cold, wooden, catholic church incense with a bit of pepper (or other spice) in the opening. The scent doesn't develop much relative to opening, but I don't consider it a disadvantage. Easy to wear in my opinion, especially for people who dress in any alternative way/goth/fashionable. If only they had greater projection, I would definitely use them all the time."", ""I decided to blind buy this one because of the comments saying it smells like a Catholic Church and the only thing I can say is.... It's truly perfection.  I've been with an eye on this fragrance for some time now because I was curious and wanted one that had a close smell to a Church so I decided to buy it for Christmas and I don't have much to say... Just that it really does smell like it!  The only thing I'm not that happy it's because they don't have the 100ml version but still... I'll make sure this one lasts on my collection because it's a masterpiece for me :)"", 'If there was ever a cold smelling perfume it would be Incense Avignon, very very big aldehydes in the opening companied by the incense resembling of a clean white smoke when u burn an incense stick, doesn\'t smell like a resinous incense or a smokey incense per se, smells like you\'re in an empty church and u light up an incense stick but all you can smell is the transparent white smoke in the air, i get the ever so slight vanilla giving a little sweetness in the background but it\'s not very prominent, i find the aldehydes to last through the very end of the lifespan of the fragrance, it fades down in the mid but i call always get this aldehydic, clean, almost musky aldehydes, which could be what some of the ppl in the reviews are referring to, i don\'t find it off-putting i think it works in the composition quite well. The more it dries down i can almost detect a powdery feel along side the amber, it\'s not a thick amber, nor a ""true"" amber, at least that\'s not what i\'d consider an ambery dry down but it definitely has an ambery feeling to the dry down, i think it\'s a brilliant composition, it\'s definitely a joy to wear and a breath of fresh air from all the redundancy we keep seeing in the fragrance market, in terms of performance yes it\'s very light and it sits close to the skin, i also find it to play peekaboo in a sense where it despairs at times and come back again, i can\'t always detect it which gives more intrigue to the composition, in conclusion, amazing from Comme Des Garcons and Bertrand Duchaufour.', 'The cathedral in Strasberg right after Sunday services. Very cool experience. Saw graffiti from the 1600s on the wall by the cock. Unfortunately the performance is subpar.', ""I like this scent - I love incense. But... the dishsoap/bubblebath/fairy liquid element is something I really wish it didn't have. And its performance is poor. It's a light incense, pleasant, vaguely churchy - but just off churchy; it really doesn't capture the real nature of church incense (and I've spent many years in the highest of high churches). There is a loose, light dry spice in the background; a sort-of mulled-wine-y hodgepodge. I like it, but... surprisingly, not a love from me. I wish it was darker, deeper, more meditative - and less bright and soapy-clean. I see lots of comments below on the 'clean-ness' and 'lightness/thin-ness', and I should have paid more attention. Honestly, I think real incense lovers will get more mileage out of Majd al Sultan for ¬£18/100ml, than from this at ¬£70/50ml. There is some cross-over in the spiced incense, though they are not straighforwardly similar. But the Majd al Sultan has more smoke, depth, a greater range of resins - and no Fairy liquid. The Majd al Sultan also powers through a day, and this is a very short-lived experience."", ""Very enjoyable wear. The aldehydes make this shine. Clean, with a touch amber and incense. It does have a similar vibe to Dior Sport 2021 and that's not a bad thing."", 'The first time I sampled Avignon, it was sweltering high summer and I was not prepared to appreciate it. I found it too clean and thin‚Äîit initially made me think less of the wooden pews, stone walls, and soaring vault of a cathedral and more of a spotless church bathroom. Being accustomed to the woodier notes of the other fragrances in CDG‚Äôs Incense series, I was a little confused by its airy, fizzy, vanilla-cola sweetness. (Having attended catholic mass exactly once in my life, I also had next to no familiarity with church incense itself). I rated Avignon as my least favourite of the series, with the caveat that I still haven‚Äôt sampled Jaisalmer. How things have changed! Now that the chill of autumn has set in, I‚Äôve been craving warmer, sweeter, resinous aromas and seeking out more amber and incense perfumes. I‚Äôve grown very fond of the incense bases in CDG 2 Man and Eris‚Äô Scorpio Rising, in which incense is blended with leathery notes‚Äîalso the case in Trudon‚Äôs Revolution and CDG Zagorsk, both of which I enjoy. Trudon Mortel is a dark, spicy (but still woody) take on church incense that led me down the path of appreciating ecclesiastical frankincense and myrrh as the focus of a fragrance, and Jovoy‚Äôs Liturgie des Heures is an even purer church incense with a rich, musky, slightly boozy amber sweetness. But coming back to Avignon in this frame of mind revealed a completely new experience. In cold weather, its chilly austerity unfolds its celestial wings, clean and pure. It‚Äôs relaxing and meditative, with a fine, rarefied sweetness that develops from the sparkling elemi/aldehyde c-12 opening into a subtle, resinous vanilla. The blending of the various notes (chamomile, labdanum, ambrette, cedar, patchouli, rosewood, oakmoss) is superbly smooth and unified, like the harmony of voices in a Gregorian chant‚ÄîI salute Bertrand Duchaufour‚Äôs mastery! I‚Äôve gone from being intrigued to borderline obsessed, craving a sniff of aldehydic olibanum even on days when I feel like wearing a different fragrance. I still have a list of other church-incense frags to try (with Filippo Sorcinelli at the top), but now I get why Avignon is such a revered reference. I‚Äôm a convert. üôè', 'Smells beautiful, though this is the same incense profile that most of the big name ""churchy incense"" scents are going for, so if you have Heeley Cardinal, Jovoy La Liturgie des Heures, etc. then you probably don\'t need this one. Sillage and longevity are pretty sub-par, definitely only appropriate for enjoying at home or for throwing on for a few quick errands out of the house, etc. The rest of the scents in this line from CdG, while they suffer from similar performance issues, are all fantastic and worth grabbing. This one just has many other options that smell the same with better performance. I\'d personally recommend Histoires de Parfums Encens Roi if you\'re after this smell but with some legs.', 'I imagined a huge Catholic cathedral, but for me this perfume is more like a small cozy church in a pine forest. The durability and sillage are quite standard, nothing special. For its price it is very good. But I personally do not see this fragrance as an everyday one, it is unusual in a good way. A very photorealistic church smell.', 'Not at all what I was expecting, nor does my nose line up with the other reviews on here. There‚Äôs a vaguely nice powdery incense here that is unfortunately disguised by a sour unpleasant note. It almost smells like a cleaning spray, or urinal cakes as another person mentioned. To me it comes across very headachey. Thankfully the projection is very minimal.', 'A solemn Catholic church with gorgeous wafts of chamomile- absolutely transportive!', 'So I actually blind bought this since I am obsessed with churchy fragrances and everybody was saying that it smells exactly like a gothic cathedral. I was NOT disappointed, it‚Äôs one of the most beautiful scents I own and it‚Äôs just so warm, very incensy , lowkey spicy (but the spice kinda disappears after an hour or so and you are just left with a balsamic incense) in other words: if you are into incense and thinking of blind buying this one- you won‚Äôt be disappointed, it‚Äôs a safe blind buy imo. I literally can‚Äôt stop smelling my wrist because it‚Äôs so good, smells very luxurious. A little bit masc leaning, but still very unisex', ""On my second bottle and will absolutely be buying a third. It is every bit worthy of its acclaim. A transcendent, intoxicating, dare I say sexy fragrance. So spicy and mysterious and dark but not heavy. It is smoky but not ashy - more so very true to incense, full of spice and warmth. I agree with reviews saying it has a cola aspect, but it does not come off as gourmand to me.  I would like to smell like this for every second of every day if possible (but it is not, because it disappears SO quickly). The bottle is fairly small so I have to ration - it doesn't help that if I'm feeling very serious I will spray multiple times in a day. If it was longer lasting it would be an absolutely perfect fragrance. But it's probably for the better, because I would be far too full of myself if I smelled like this all of the time. Highly highly recommend trying if you're on the fence."", 'This is a classic ‚Äúchurchy‚Äù incense perfume and gosh, I love it. It‚Äôs exactly what you expect from the title: smoky, resinous, a little spicy. The incense is obviously prominent but it‚Äôs well balanced by the resinous/balsamic notes so it smells more like a perfume and less like, you know, an incense stick. That being said, I think you‚Äôd have to like incense perfumes to enjoy this. And I do! Really good projection and longevity, too.', 'Mandatory wear before attending your local Batcave party. Wear this while dancing to The Passion of Lovers by the Bauhaus. This is the ultimate goth fragrance for all the children of the night out there!', 'Comme des Garcon Incense-Avignon makes me think of Jesus Christ. It smells like a Catholic Church, that was just under sanctification and purification from the thurible carrying Frankincense, Myrh and Olibanum. Every wooden bench was laced by this invigorating smell. This scent is nostalgic because it brings me back to my childhood years in Azores, while frequenting churches. If you want to experience, what this makes me think of, give it a try.', '""Comme des Gar√ßons Avigon"" is a very distinctive and polarizing fragrance, with a scent reminiscent of a Catholic church or incense, which can evoke strong personal memories or associations. Its uniqueness might make it a love-or-hate fragrance, and i suggest that it\'s not something to purchase without trying first. While it has good longevity, its sillage isn\'t particularly strong. ""Bakhoor,"" a traditional incense used in the Middle East, adds an interesting cultural reference, helping to convey the type of scent to those familiar with it. Overall, while i appreciate its uniqueness, it\'s not necessarily a fragrance\xa0for\xa0everyone.', 'A beautiful perfume that evokes medieval, gothic cathedrals steeped in centuries of incense. You can smell cold stone and wooden benches, as well as dust dancing in the stained-glass light.

I smell incense of course but there‚Äôs definitely old woods, resins, varnish or polish. There‚Äôs also just a hint of vanilla. This isn‚Äôt for everyone. I‚Äôd say this leans masculine, but a woman could wear it. I‚Äôd also say this is definitely for someone mature that is distinguished. I absolutely love this fragrance. It‚Äôs a rather small bottle. I got a 50ml bottle for 100 bucks. Also there‚Äôs not a lot of stores that carry this fragrance it seems. Again I would recommend this fragrance. I‚Äôve never smelled anything like it.', ""It's a likeable fragrance but definitely not a cologne/perfume because it potency is lower than a room spray. needs to be in a oil strength"", ""When it comes to incense, especially church-inspired incense, one of the most frequently mentioned names is Comme des Gar√ßons Series 3 Incense: Avignon. As a fan of incense and resins, I had to try this iconic scent. Right from the start, I was greeted by the Roman Catholic style of myrrh and olibanum, instantly recognizable from the countless hours spent in church with my grandmother. It perfectly captures the solemn ambiance of gothic cathedrals, with their vast, high halls and tapestries that have absorbed the sacred frankincense aroma for centuries. Surprisingly, it doesn't turn dark like many church incense fragrances do, and I think this is due to the chamomile. The chamomile and vanilla in the dry down make it lighter and more airy as it settles. I can see why this is considered a benchmark in incense fragrances. More than 20 years old and still going strong, it‚Äôs a contemplative and timeless masterpiece. A must-try for all incense lovers."", 'churchy', ""I grew up in a very Catholic country. The smell of incense in the church is always in my head. I can't say I love incense perfumes, but I can appreciate the well made ones. To my nose all of the series from Comme des Garcons, unfortunately, don't smell realistic. There is something synthetic, screechy underneath them all that fails to embody that hypnotic scent of true incense. They all smell very similar, but give such a headache, they are simply too much, whereas true incense in the church is spiritual, invigorating and captivating."", 'This is my favourite one of the series. The one and only downer being that it is the shortest lasting perfume I have ever worn, you would be lucky if it lasts more than twenty minutes.', 'The more I wear this, the less it seems like an entirely literal take on the smell of a Catholic Church, and more like a subtle beautification of that smell. It‚Äôs almost impressionistic. Monet‚Äôs paintings, for example, capture the essence of light and nature, transporting you to the scene‚Äîbut he exaggerates and simplifies certain tones to create an overall harmonic effect. Similarly, with Avignon you immediately understand that it‚Äôs a church incense fragrance, but that incense is supported by the dry woodiness of cedar and a vague warm spiciness (cinnamon? nutmeg? I don‚Äôt know). This is one of Comme des Garcons‚Äô greatest strengths as a house, that they can make something that straddles the line between an edgy literal representation and a perfume-y sort of familiar style. Wear this if you‚Äôve ever been called ‚Äúpretentious.‚Äù', 'This is exactly what I was looking for. Same scent as walking into an old Catholic Church in Europe.', ""I don't remember how the story started, what exactly I was looking for and how I first came across Comme des Garcons - Incense Series 3 Avignon. I was probably looking for incense perfumes, cool, enigmatic, impenetrable, spiritually charged and mysterious perfumes. Initially intrigued by the minimalistic and cool design of the bottle, I suspected that its humble facade was hiding rich secrets, so I set about researching, curious to learn its secrets. ‚ÄûPowerful and intense, Avignon evokes the medieval city in the south of France which surpassed Rome as the Catholic Church's power center in the 14th century. It's the scent of gothic cathedrals and Papal palaces, of tapestries imbued with centuries of incense. Of cold marble steps, holy relics and dark confessions. The recognizable smells of frankincense and myrrh open the high mass of Avignon, giving way to the almost eye-smarting, gloriously smoky and resinous heart. A dry vanilla and soft Roman chamomile dull the edges of this reverent fragrance. Beautiful, dark and mysterious, Avignon takes its place among the most talked about (and admired) of CdG's entire line.‚Äù Cold marble steps and tapestries imbued with centuries of incense? Say what? Storyteller at heart (or so I like to think), I had no escape, they convinced me with words. Although an agnostic at heart, I always yearn for the silence and darkness of Gothic cathedrals and dream of the secrets hidden within the cold stone walls. I blame the grandparents who forced me to church as a child, and the tour guides who dragged us around the historic cathedrals in Europe. Once inhaled, that smell of incense is hard to forget. And although I don't see myself converting to any religion anytime soon, CdG won me over forever with this perfume. This sound quite dramatic, maybe I took it too far. But that's what Avignon offers, an imaginary journey through the mists of centuries, far removed from daily routines and boring weekdays. At the same time, it induces a meditative state of calm, not necessarily of resignation, but acceptance, it makes you turn your attention inwards for once."", 'recently i only wear this, or a frankincense oil. my mum keeps telling me i smell like a house party in the 90s, she taught me how to make mulled wine like they did in the coven. i live next to to a catholic church and i just renewed my lease (this smells good)', 'I was told that this was a modern classic, and one of the reason why every brand has an incense ""soliflore"" in their offerings now. It\'s hard not to see why. The chamomile-aldehyde-frankincense accord is truly iconic. I grew up Catholic, and this is the only incense scent that really reminds me of service. It nails the powdery, gossamer quality right. It\'s a shame that it dies quick and devolves into almost pure iso e super and ambrette. Otherwise it\'s perfect. Also, don\'t get Incense Full. Yes, it\'s close enough but it lacks that X factor that Avignon has. Also that thing has too much cedar and patchouli that takes me out of the atmosphere.', 'Is my nose cooked? Have I been bamboozled? I adore incense and I have been dying to try this fragrance. First of all, I do not get any smoke which is crucial to a fragrance all about incense, in my humble opinion. Also, it is somewhat cold and I think of incense as being warm and enveloping. I do understand the references to the cold and spacious stone architectures of churches, but I do not think that is translated well here. It is oddly fizzy too. I am reminded of a strange cola or Pez candies. Quite the unexpected vibe. That mixed with the synthetic hint of a hint of cheap unburned incense stick makes it smell like incense-flavored La Croix.

I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised at how unisex it is. Although I will say it would be an exceedingly handsome fragrance on a man and is very goth / intimidating on a woman.  Surprisingly sweet on application but on the skin is very woody (cedar plank specifically) and spicy.  Very picturesque scent of Catholic incense to me, maybe less smoky than the real thing but I think this makes it more versatile. I would recommend as a blind buy if this sounds interesting to you. I could easily see this as an everyday scent for lots of men and any woman with the right sense of style.', 'A few hours ago I started my day with Incense Avignon, the king of incense fragrances in my book. It leaves the perfect little scent bubble for me as I move around, and just enough for others to wonder what it is they just smelled. While it is a liner scent on me, I appreciate the frankincense not being soapy and having a slight citrus like brightness to it. It smells clean, elegant, and refined. I feel the use of pure and top quality ingredients surround me. The nostalgia takes me back to catholic grade school ash wed. This is frankincense laying on a woody base, nothing sweet. I appreciate the fragrance.', ""I've got this, Kyoto and Zagorsk going head to head. Kyoto has a lovely, bright, clean, non-smoky, non-stinky, yuzu-ish or lemony incense resin thing going on. There's more than a hint of fruity bubblegum sweetness in the top but there's also a kind of understated fullness or roundness underneath. The fragrance reminds me of fresh ginger, cardamom, lemongrass (honeyed Indonesian lemongrass tea) and probably clean vetiver too but the rounder aspect makes me think of--I don't even know what--lemon candy? Honey, even? Beeswax? (Edit: it may be just immortelle.) At any rate the fragrance is not all top-end zing but I do think that's a huge part of what it has to offer. Zagorsk is more recessed and perhaps comes perilously close to lacking detail and being too dry or dark (though not at all in a heavy way) to make much of an impression. I don't get any big hit of sauna wood but the many descriptions I've read regarding walking through a coniferous forest in cold weather, more than likely with snow on the ground, with just a hint of a kind of greenish woody incense in the air (quite possibly, yes, from an Orthodox church) are on point. The touch of ambery powder here is nice. It almost makes me think of snow. The fragrance is quite soft, impressionistic and definitely reserved but I like it. Essentially I see almost a clear, bright yellow or green-yellow (straw) resin with the Kyoto, whereas Zagorsk is more green, like pine resin or mastic. Avignon is somewhat fuller, rounder and probably sweeter than either. There's citrusy sweetness in Kyoto but Avignon has the myrrh and so on, and essentially there's more ambery dark-resin sweetness in Avignon than in the other two. Avignon is the gummiest of the three--not in terms of bubblegum fruitiness but in terms of almost rubbery resin or balsam. It's still quite soft and impressionistic, but at its core, of the three fragrances, it probably does offer the biggest dose of incense of the kind that many of us in Western Europe or the Americas are most familiar with in the context of church. Is any of the three full-bottle worthy? It depends what you're looking for. Kyoto would probably be lovely in cool spring or autumn weather (but maybe more the spring for me). The picture that Zagorsk paints favours cold weather but I'm not sure the fragrance has quite enough presence to stand up to that, so for me it may be a scent that, like the original Encre Noire, is lovely but suffers a little from not being quite convincingly suitable for the kind of context where in principle it should most shine. Kyoto and Zagorsk particularly are quite delicate, though not in completely the same way. They would be great for indoor relaxation and reflection. Because it's a little fuller, sweeter and more opulent, with a little more presence--at this moment, it reminds me of the far, far bolder and less sophisticated Bentley Intense--Avignon may be the only one of the three that I would feel comfortable wearing in the winter as well as the autumn. Then again, I am a huge Smiths and Morrissey fan and was probably always likely to prefer Avignon. CdG perfumers, take a bow. There's always someone somewhere with a big nose who knows."", 'Excellent quality Myrrh perfume. It has a certain coldness which is not the direction I would have taken, but which describes well French cathedrals and the smell of their old stones.  A refreshing departure from mainstream fragrances. The dry down on the next day is excellent.  (Tested on paper) I am comparing this with Jovoy La Lithurgie des Heures. This one is better imo, although both are of good quality.', ""I finally got my hands on this beauty and I am so happy. Not much to say except that this is a gorgeous Catholic Church smell, which oddly reminds me more of old England than France, not sure why.  Sweet, yet moody, perfectly gothic. Catholic aesthetics without being dogmatic. I own Zagorsk and surprisingly I find Avignon more familiar and nostalgic church scent, even though I grew up in an Orthodox country. There's definitely some magic in this perfume.  I get a decent longevity of around 3 hours and sillage is also moderate. Perfectly unisex. Nothing else to say but endless compliments to this fragrance!"", ""This is such an amazing and unique fragrance. To me it smells like an old cathedral where the gobelins and heavy velvet curtains have been soaking in frankincense and myrrh smoke forever. I just need to close my eyes and I feel like I'm teleported there. The resinous, spicy and smoky notes make Avignon mysterious and meditative. It leaves a pleasant, sweet trail in my nose, I think its the vanilla. Perfect to wear with black, elegant clothes. It gives me a big gothic vibe that I cannot compare to any other fragrance I have smelled yet"", 'The opening has a strong and beautiful cistus note, smells like a Catholic mass.

Such a beautiful fragrance', ""Incense, all the way. But is it church incense or new age store incense? At first spray, it reminded me of the incense sticks my brother burned in high school to cover up the smell of weed. But after a while, it was straight church incense. I was immediately back at one of the many beautiful Polish churches here in Chicago, being blessed with the incense, imagining my prayers floating up to heaven with the smoke. There's a touch of a soft, creamy note- likely the vanilla and musk. However, Avignon is not sweet or sexy at all. It's a celibate perfume. This is definitely masculine leaning but I would still wear it. The sillage is decent, several hours later I'm still getting hits of frankincense and myrrh."", 'Purchased this after I bought Full Incense by Montale. I am intrigued by churchy scents for some reason. Avignon and Full Incense are brothers (or sisters depending on your sex).

It's a beautiful and nostalgic scent for me, but I can see how this could be weird or uncomfortable to someone who is not Catholic or has bad memories associated with Catholicism. Moderate projection.. the person you're speaking to could smell it but not the whole room. While I enjoyed testing this, I couldn't see myself wearing it often. If I smelled this on someone I would assume they were in the clergy or very devout.. so if that's the vibe you're going for this is a great perfume for you."", ""A very realistic church smell to me; dry, cold and woody church to be exact. It opens with a strong resin smell, but the drydown is pure cedar and smoke from the incense. It really reminds me of the smell of the freshly sharpened wooden pencil!

It's great if you want pure incense / frankincense smell, but it can be a bit too monotone (I loved it nonetheless)"", ""there's a weird fizziness in this that really perplexes me. it goes away pretty quickly but i struggle with it. after it goes away i find it extremely beautiful but i'm not sure if i can get past the fizz to warrant a full bottle. i think it does what it's looking to do really well though"", 'Bought blind, taking advantage of a great offer, I fell in love with it at the first spray and was particularly impressed with its performance on my skin, both in terms of projection and longevity. It is a powerful and extremely evocative scent that puts you in a church during a service. It is not just incense; it carries with it all the suggestions of the liturgical environment. Sweet, yet cold and icy thanks to its surprising balsamic characteristics, it recalls the dense smoke of incense grains burning in censers, with the addition of masterfully blended notes capable of perfectly recreating the scent of the interior of a majestic cathedral: wood, moisture, sharp lights and shadows, the choirs of the faithful, silence, the altar. It explodes on my skin, spreads out for at least half a meter and remains there, imperishable, for well over six hours, while rather than smelling it on me, I feel it around, like a mystical aura surrounding myself. I find something devilish in its perfection, between the sacred and the profane: it is the sheepskin the wolf wears to infiltrate the flock, the fancy dress the swindler wears, the smile of politeness of one who refuses a favor, the witchcraft that hides deception. Yet its light remains dazzling, its icy coldness sweet and attractive, like a lantern for moths. A weapon to be used wisely, rather than a perfume.', ""A decent church-y scent but not quite the specific church smell I'm chasing - it's a little too bright I think. I found the longevity and projection very poor which is why it's only getting an 'ok' from me."", ""Amazingly realistic incense perfume. Total cathedral in a bottle! At first, I thought it was gorgeous but maybe not wearable however, it is actually quite lovely on my skin. I want to try Zagorsk, it's sibling from CDG's incense collection because Avignon has a hint of stone, like you're in a stone church, and I am on the hunt for the same profile but with more of a wooden note. Definitely worth a try for a wearable yet realistic atmospheric scent. I got several compliments on this one!"", ""I don't like incense as a fragrance note but my curiosity to try Incense Avignon was piqued after finding out this is Morrissey's signature perfume.

You can thank me later.', 'I wanted to love this but it just smells like Hinoki.', ""Perhaps someone deeper into the fragrance world can enlighten me. If I want deep, rich, woodsy style incense perfumes that are true to their origin, where do I go to find a more feminine or true unisex twist besides Passage d'Enfer? I like Avignon, but like the fuller and more bombastic Encens Roi, which also has Avignon beat in terms of sillage and longevity, it skews masculine in a way that makes me not think of it as an everyday choice. There is a Japanese brand of incense, Shoyeido, makea incense fragrances that are delicate, woodsy and often a touch sweet. Where and what is that version of a frankincense perfume? I think I have homework to do.

Avignon has a fresh and balsamic feel- and evokes a sense of being in an intimate cathedral, set in an evergreen forest in rural France. High rafters within are crafted from cedar, the pughs of aromatic hardwood. The atmosphere is lit only by candles; censers of resins are alight, the smoke billowing.

If I shove my nose onto my skin I can pick up some more of the woods, but honestly, this is too weak to be anything but a disappointment. Some have described this as a cold incense fragrance, but i think they may be conflating cold with watered down. There are a number of better incense fragrances out there.

You had the PTO, the money, the hankering and it all added up to booking wonderful accomodations and amazing sounding tours in and around Tokyo. GO. YOU.  Then from the moment your plane takes off from the airport in Atlanta on its\' way to Toronto it seems as though everything that could go wrong DID go wrong. Weird smoke in the cabin (it turned out to be a cloud of baby powder???) triggered a return to the airport and hours of waiting and dread and stress being heaped upon you--brick by brick, hour by hour--while you stared at the clock wondering if you would miss your connecting flight. And guess what! You did miss it. And you\'ll be getting there not just many hours after the original flight. 3 DAYS after the original flight. The hotel food in Toronto was bland and cold as you hunched over it with your phone making cancellations and re-reserving tours and lots and lots of ""I\'m sorry. There are no rooms available""\'s. You think about going back home but you don\'t. No. This is a bucket list item. You\'re doing it. When you\'re finally on the flight to Narita Airport you breathe a sigh of relief. Then 3 hours in you feel weird grumbly liquidy feelings. Diarrhea. The bland food in Toronto\'s vengeance was upon you. Barely able to sleep an hour at a time you land exhausted, dehydrated and defeated to a degree you\'ve never experienced. This was a mistake. You get to your hotel in Shibuya swimming in sorrow. You quickly fall into a black, dreamless slumber for 15 hours straight.  When you wake up you decide to try to see if something will finally go as it should. You go for a walk to explore the beautiful area around the hotel and you start to feel a little better. Maybe it wasn\'t a mistake. You work your way away from the heavily crowded touristy areas. You decide to let go and allow fate to lead you wherever it may. Not long after you do you walk near a fenced area with a small rock garden. Next to the garden stands a wooden temple with a tiled roof surrounded by beautifully groomed trees. The gate is open. You step inside. You are completely alone as you make your way towards the temple. You remove your shoes, make your way inside to sit on a small cushion and you begin to meditate. As you sit in silence you are enveloped by the smell of incense, the faint decay of unimaginably ancient woods felled and shaped with handcrafted tools and sacredness. You feel the most profound sense of welcoming, peace, compassion and acceptance you\'ve felt in years.', ""I've never been to a catholic church so I have no idea what that smells like, but if it smells like this I really like it! For me the cedar are very strong, the woody notes comes through a lot along with something soapy and herbal. It leans masculine but I still feel that it's a true unisex perfume. It's clean, dark, cosy. I thought it would be much stronger and meaner but it's not at all. It's more of a softer skinscent with a vintage vibe to it. I really like this one!

I will wear it whenever wherever, I really don't care, this is not the kind of perfume you use to impress anyone, but if it does so much the better!  It's cozy and comforting wearing a little before bed. On the chance that I do wake up in the middle of the night, it's absolutely soothing.  I wear this for myself and it feels very personal with the low sileage. Others have said it doesn't last long, which I found to be true on my wrists, but spritzed under my shirt it lasts hours, getting little wafts of it throughout the day.

It's quiet and unpretentious."", 'Working my way through an incense sampler. This opens most like a traditional incense stick, sort of a smoky nag champa.

Even for a 21st-century sceptic raised atheist in a historically Protestant country, this is Old Church personified. It is some time in the early fourteenth century and you are right there in the opulent, grandiose, world-changing court of the Avignon Anti-Popes and big things are happening. Most notably a massive gilded thurible is swooshing all around your head, wreathing you in sacred smoke and the odour of sanctity.  Truly exceptionally beautiful, fresh and fizzy frankincense up top (and/or mimicked with aldehydes) which is somehow cool and green and aerated, as well as golden and honeyed and resinous. This might be the smell of an old stone church but there\'s not a whisper of damp or rot: it may seem dark and hallowed but it\'s dry too, dry as dust, dry as the crumbly pages of the parchment books and the most erudite scholars\' wit. It swathes you in history, swaddles you in heritage, saturates your skin and clothes with thousands of years\' worth of scent memories of reverence. And it also has that usual Duchaufour magic of letting the air and the light in, too: somehow you can sense the sunbeams, slanting in through scriptorium windows, which allows even this apparently heavy and ""thick"" atmosphere of resins to open up and sing, like the choir invisible. It\'s not all solemn ritual (like say Trudon Olim) - there is true joy and spontaneity there too. Glory be! Definitely shines most beautifully on warmer days in my experience, as you get the full rounded richness of the bottom end more clearly. But basically heavenly any time. (Has there ever been a Pope Bertrand? On the basis of this I think there definitely should be.)', ""This smells like midnight mass on christmas eve. I don't know how often I'll wear it, but it's so evocative and brings me back to when I used to feel that wonder."", ""It's a solid scent, and it smells exactly like the pews of a 700 year old church if that's what you want to smell like. I personally am not into that, but I can respect it. Not an amazing performer, other people won't smell this unless they're quite up close and personal."", ""I love wearing a churchy incense fragrance from time to time - I find it calming and grounding. There are many good ones around, my favorite probably being Ciro by Trudon and Unum by Lavs. Those are also awfully expensive though and as much as I love the nuances in those fragrances, I'm beginning to think this one is probably the best bang for one's buck. Cold and wet, like a cathedral in November, Avignon scratches the itch. Excellent."", ""This is a tough one because I love it so much in the sample vial. It smells exactly like walking into an old and beautiful Catholic church, reminding me of everything I once associated with awe and mysticism. The incense and spices notes of this are spot on. But once it's on skin it reads a little more mature and musty on me than I would like... might just be one of those cases where I love the smell, but I don't want to smell like it myself. It didn't have crazy sillage, but enough that in the first few hours I could smell it on myself and it was a little overwhelming. After that, it wore closer to the skin, more of the resins came out and it was more manageable, but in the long run I don't think I'm confident enough to pull this off.

This is radiant incense, resins, cedar, sandalwood, chamomile, patchouli, vanilla, ISO E Super and the molecular genius of Aldehyde C-12. It's no more pure than anything here on Planet Earth and it's somewhat fleeting, lasting only a few hours before evaporating into the ether. Longevity, like mortality, isn't the point.

I remember saving up for this for such a long time on an enthusiastic blind buy. I quite enjoy challenging scents and have many years' experience with real myrrh, frankincense, and benzoin. I'm sorry to say that Avignon didn't remind me of any of them. It was just a shrill, chemical cheesegrater to the nose. I've noticed negative reviews get very few balloons here on fragrantica -- but hopefully at least one person will benefit from my experience. In my research to discover why I hated what so many others enjoyed, I discovered it might be a genetic thing. I've heard response to ISO E Super is genetically determined, and my neurology just knee-jerk rejects it. If I may bring up a sensitive topic, ISO E Super, the base of this perfume, is a cause for concern beyond taste -- it is highly toxic to aquatic life, and it is biocumulative.

A true unisex fragrance is hard to come by. And this one simply surpasses the concept gender. That said I believe it's one of the absolute best fragrances in particular a male can wear.

It's easy on the senses, it will not invade space, it smells unique, it has a story to tell..."", ""Gorgeous, airy, refined frankincense incense smoke. I definitely feel that this one is a sacred scent, so I put off purchasing it for the longest time, but after the year we've all had, part of me feels that nothing is sacred anymore... or maybe everything is sacred. Yes, that one. So there was no point in me putting off purchasing it or wearing it whenever I want. A lot of people think of incense as cerebral, moody, or even brooding, goth, etc. but I am finding Avignon to be purely pleasurable, cozy and uplifting without any thought or analysis involved. It has me both huffing my wrist and rolling around in it with abandon, as well as sticking it under the noses of all of my family members. It's absolutely perfect on this cold, foggy, rainy and windy spring day by the ocean. It fits the moods and the weather expertly. I have frankincense essential oil and this is truly like the frankincense incense burning in churches, not the essential oil which has more of a green, damp and earthy profile. Avignon is silvery dry and almost mineral with a smooth yet complex smoky woodiness. I wouldn't want it to be any stronger than it is. The ephemeral quality that others take issue with actually suits it quite well in my opinion. It's meant to swirl about you like a ghost, not slam into you like a solid wall of scent . I'm so grateful to finally have added this to my collection. It's so high quality and absolutely beyond words beautiful, as well as being an exemplary object lesson in Catholic church incense. Just wanted to add that if you're considering adding Avignon to your collection, I strongly suggest using Arielle Shoshana instead of Luckyscent. They overnight shipped my perfume the same day I ordered it for free and included a ton of samples I didn't even ask for. Also they're a small business and it's always better to go that route whenever possible."", ""This was unfortunately not the Incense I was looking for. It's not at all smoky, it's more like an incense stick before it's been burned. There's also an annoying dollop of sweetness which suffocates anything else. If you want a dark brooding kind of incense this isn't it. The search continues"", 'Honestly, from all the rave reviews, I was expecting more. This is much ""safer"" than I expected. It smells like there was originally a more powerful, dark version that someone was told to dial back. Definitely wearable, but sillage and longevity for me were pretty poor, even with several sprays. I think I got much better performance with Kyoto Incense, and that was with a dabber sample. It\'s a fine, safe incense fragrance, but does not live up to the hype for me. Also, the bottle looks like room spray, not very stylish for nearly $100.', 'For me this is a joke that ends before the punchline. Longevity is awful, hour max before it melts into my pores. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm dabbing from a sample instead of spraying (I dabbed a good amount!) Really is a shame because I see what they‚Äôre trying to do. Even bigger shame because the little I see, I don‚Äôt love. Patchouli is prominent, and I dislike patchouli with incense. I‚Äôll keep on trying until my sample runs out but there are better incense frags for sure.', ""This is one of the most nostalgic incenses I've ever tried. Very very evocative of a Catholic church. For me, it brought me back to the Duomo in Milan; tall, imposing, grey stone. Despite feeling like a very 'serious' fragrance, there's something very clean and purifying in the drydown that makes me feel like I just got out of a very quiet Scandinavian spa.  This is the type of fragrance that may serve as a conversation starter but also doesn't quite suit any activity besides either quiet meditation of visiting the public archives to do research on architectural practices in the Middle Ages.  Lasts a good while, but doesn't need to project to be heard."", ""This smells really nice, and does smell like the incense that is burned in a church. Other than relaxing at home, I cannot find any other occasion for wearing this. Longevity on my skin was around five hours and it radiated within an arm's length. This was a like for me. 7/10"", '- What you think is ""incense"", is actually aldehyde.  To be precise, Aldehyde C-12 is responsible for that weird, unnatural, cool-tone, ""plastic""-‚Äúpiney‚Äù-‚Äúfizzling‚Äù top in Avignon. Some other brands (e.g. James Heeley) may use descriptors like ""fresh linen"" for such note. Why use aldehyde? My guess is, a lot of the natural extract of real frankincense/olibanum (""incense"")-- be it critical CO2, absolute, essential oil -- all smells very...challenging, to say the least. It reminds me of sharp wet paint, or new furniture which gave off toxic formaldehyde ‚Äî‚Äî perhaps that\'s why people burn incense, instead of extracting perfumes out of it.  Perhaps, that\'s also why perfumer Douchaufour chose Aldehyde C-12 to mimic the weird cool-tone ""plastic"" quality of incense, without setting off toxic odor alarm. Now back to Avignon, after the initial blast of aldehyde, we dive into soft, mellow, tuber-y bitter juice --which I caught in many other incense works, but yet to find what exactly this note is. Is it myrrh? Or just another facet of frankincense?  The ""plastic"" aldehyde is joined with a dry woody partner, and they dance with mellow bitter juice hand in hand for the rest of the journey. Before closing time, a bit of dry-date(the fruit)-like labdanum is exposed to air. Finally, everyone left, we\'re only left with dry ash of burnt balsamic.', ""Interesting fact, if you layer Full Incense by Montale, with Bentley Absolute (spray one on your wrist and other one on your neck, don't mix them), you'll get CdG Avignon. Maybe even better, you get more intense version of the incense little bit darker and dryer, and that spicy Coke vibe from Absolute, with some leathery touch. If they included benzoin and tobacco instead of vanilla and musk, this would have been so perfect. Only 9/10 for this masterpiece"", ""Avignon has become the reference incense for fragrance enthusiasts, and its hard to deny that compositionally it is evocative of a thurible swaying amongst the devoted in a Catholic church. It is a bit more than that, though, as it has elements that make it more impressionistic, more a perfume than purely a novel incense facsimile. We are not talking Demeter here.  Chamomile in the top note through the heart, lends a certain ineffable quality that reminds of its use in Aromatics Elixir, soothing and almost imparting a 'pastoral' feel that contrasts with the stark, stony chill of the olibanum and elemi overdose. The top, with the coniferous, spiky Aldehyde C-12, also lend to this chill that is soon warmed as myrrh, labdanum and what I can detect as cistus (the oil from the leaves rather than the resin of the Cistus ladanifer). In spite of the Iso E Super that lifts everything, Avignon is to my nose impressively imbued with naturals. The mildest shade of animalic, dry vegetal ambrette musk in the base makes for a really comforting skin scent in the dry down.  I now realize that this will be in my collection as not merely as a reference, but a true joy to wear. The cold yields to warm throughout its development, making it not quite as linear as has been suggested by others, and it surely suits me to a T during this snowy day in New England."", 'i love this, i always love when a memory or an identical scent to something is placed into a bottle for u too keep, however i do not know if i could pull this off as an actual perfume, idk what i would wear or where i would wear it too, that being said it is awesome for around the house very cozy. smells very much like spiritus sancti by cire trudon if you are looking for this in candle form btw!!.', 'This was love at first sniff. There is a wonderful bright citrus note that hovers right above the skin and almost acts as a buffer between your nose the deep incense at the crux of the fragrance. It almost smells like bergamot or even a lime zest coupled with deep resinous church incenses. It‚Äôs definitely unisex and is just beautiful. It piques my interest in the other incense perfumes in this line.', 'Extremely incensey. Yes, Catholic Church vibes for sure. Strong and rather piercing on initial application. Dry down is warmer, less stark, mellow and more pleasant. Fairly sweet and deep; myrrh and frankincense stand out, but on me the myrrh rapidly diminishes. A distinctive scent. This isn\'t to my taste, but I acknowledge its quality and elegant appeal. Sillage is moderate, as is longevity. Update: almost 4 years later, I own, love, am currently wearing, and am addicted to this fragrance. What can I say ‚Äì maybe I ""didn\'t get it"" initially. But I soon changed my mind!', 'I sampled all of the CdG Series 3 Incense and Avignon was the most ""churchy"" to me. I suppose that makes sense if this the one to represent Catholicism, since I grew up in Christian circles. It\'s got that nice blend of sweet myrrh and bracing clean frankincense. Notes like labdanum and ambrette add to the ""ancient building filled with tapestries and old wood"" feeling.', 'A Catholic sick call cabinet. Spot on. Well done CdG.', ""When I first bought a sample of this, I absolutely hated it. It smelled medicinal, syrupy, and cloying. But I let the sample sit for another two weeks or so and then tried it again. The second time around, the fragrance had mellowed a lot. It's definitely a churchy incense; it reminds of me of nighttime mass in a warm cathedral. I've heard/seen a lot of people describing it as cold or wet but I absolutely don't feel that at all! Avignon smells warm and woody, like fresh incense smoke being burned in the moment. A lovely churchy scent, definitely a good buy if you like incense."", ""Luckily I just bought a sample of something I thought would smell ravaging on me, but I was sorely disappointed. I put it on and from beginning to end I could not get anything else but the Church incense. It certainly helped in bringing back long lost memories of myself attending church as a child, and seeing the priest use his beautiful censer that he would swing so that the smell would fill up the whole church. I didn't get any other notes than the church incense. I like the smell but I was expecting much, much more than this. I do believe that this fragrance and I haven't got the pleasure of opening up to each other. Maybe one day... I'm always hopeful!"", ""The unironic- Holy Smokes!- Holy Grail of incense burner perfumes. If you smelled several niche frankincenses and have ever been to a catholic church you know this is the dogma and the rest of them the apocryphal. Mass olibanum ricocheting against musty woods, mouldy stones, cold as marmol, searing dark as chimney smoke.  I'm still not a converse to full-incense fragrances but this is one sort of King-s-Layer, great for spraying over roses and spicy woods. I'd like to get a little chalice of this, and I'm not exactly Galahad ov'ere."", ""Fantastic frankincense! One of my favourite smells and most early scent memories‚Ä¶ This one delivers true to life churchy vibes, very realistic indeed. Heeley Cardinal is more airy and etherial, this is thicker, fuller. Not as dense as Bois D‚ÄôEncens perhaps, but I love the slightly creamier and lactonic, sandalwood feel of this one too.  Leaning more to foresty incense and sandalwoods these days rather than smelling straight up like a church at Easter though! This is where Bentley Absolute comes in‚Ä¶ Here, the nose of GPH1 and Bois D‚ÄôEncens Michel Almairac has made what feels like a best of both. It makes that churchy theme more contemporary and wearable with it‚Äôs added cedar and papyrus. Think of it like a blend of Bois D‚ÄôEncens or Avignon and Santal 33, roughly speaking, for around 30 bucks.  This is a stunning incense fragrance though and a fantastic choice for a frankincense fragrance but for now, I'm happy enough with my bottle of Bentley Absolute. That does away with the need for this, or Bois D‚ÄôEncens for now, because its added cedar and papyrus notes make it a more contemporary wearing experience than the straight up church incense of either of those. It's a great moody room scent too, and sandalwood a great meditative personal scent to wear everyday to get your zen on!"", ""It's like they managed to bottle a less traveled room at the British museum during a rainy evening. There are old books with leather covers on the shelves, aged wood desks, counters and ancient artifacts oozing resins behind see-through mirrors. But the mirrors can't keep their aroma from slowly seeping out. I love this scent."", 'Years later, I return for a second review. No more a goth, but a hopeless migraineur... Whatever hit me in the morning, I spritzed some YSL Nu, a long lost treasure, at the back of my neck, and on my wrists. Then I reached for my 2012 bottle of Avignon for a daring feat and just wanted to see what happens this time... Good news, I am still alive!  Further good news is that, I found Avignon to be much more mellow and softer, just like I wanted it to be, years ago... The sharp cedar note (which I tend to dislike) was subdued and way more rounder if not yet still gone.  Chamomile, elemi, most importantly, frankincense and myrrh, and the cold stone walls of a medieval church, St. Mary\'s in Guildford UK, coming once again alive before my eyes, the floors, wooden doors, the marble altar...  Not only the incense, but the maturated juice brought up much more of a complete atmosphere this time, down to finite details like the statue of Mother Mary, and red velvet fine drapes adorning the apse... The old me would unapologetically be like ""now is the most apt time for sex"", but today I found myself in only peaceful contemplation and not necessarily after manifesting the divine in the union of two bodies in flesh... It felt more ethereal and transcendent, as if I spent the night in church in prayer, covered in a shawl which is now oozing the scent along with my hair... Avignon is a masterpiece, and I would for once, like to smell this on the man I love.  Objectively, it\'s supposed to be awesome on anyone and everyone who has the taste to dare.  *YSL Nu is doubling the effect by playing the Orthodox part...', ""Suddenly I'm in a medieval church. In terms of accuracy to real-life scents, this is perfect. I don't go to church, so for me when I spray this on, the scent memory is from my travels. I'm transported to a dimly lit church somewhere in Italy. The busy street outside is muffled as the ancient wooden door closes behind me. I take my hat off out of respect for others' place of worship. Light is streaming in from the stained glass windows at the far end, but in the alcoves candles flicker. A faint murmur of a deeply-pitched hymn in the minor key reverberates around the stone floors and walls. Incense is burning on the altar and the varnished pews smell as old as they probably are. Was that pretentious? Definitely. But does Avignon actually do that for me? Absolutely. I love it when fragrances transport me away and this one is one of the best in this regard. But in terms of actually wearing this, it falls down a bit. It's incredibly austere and gothic and, well, smells like a church. It doesn't have massive performance which is actually a positive, as if this projected like a monster I could never even consider wearing it around people. But I may just like this enough to buy a bottle to wear when I'm alone and in the mood, or just spray on my hand to remind myself of its beauty. It's priced very well for the quality (this could easily be niche), so I might just be able to justify it. I like it a lot, potentially bottle-worthy.

I don‚Äôt find the usual fragrances people recommend for Christmas suitable for such weather. Avignon is different. It does smell like wooden church pews, but it also smells like laundered sheets, now dry, cooling on the washing line in the late afternoon breeze. It‚Äôs not a summer scent but the fragrance itself does well in the summer. I also feel‚Ä¶ ‚Äòright‚Äô wearing it at Christmas, as though I am acknowledging what the holiday is about.  Incense (especially frankincense - Avignon smells similar to a piece of burning Omani frankincense) and cool palisander rosewood are at the heart of Avignon. Cool, dry, austere: don‚Äôt be fooled by the vanilla as there is nothing sweet and cuddly here. Linear and unisex. There are so many incense fragrances on the market now.

I'd say it's also the lightest of the fragrances and with the least amount of depth comparatively. For the price I think it's fabulous and it has a drier, cooler feeling than the other two, so it would be appropriate through a different portion of the year.  Original: It is entirely what I wanted it to be. It is 100% Three Kings Cathedral Blend Resin, boswellia papyrifera, commiphora myrrha and boswellia sacra. The smell of a Catholic Church on the nose. I like incense fragrances, but this is the best in terms of quality of smell. It doesn't have great longevity honestly, for what it is you hope and expect it will last for a long time but it is a skin scent within a few hours. The projection is fine, I think it's quite tame but appropriate. Honestly I am gonna have to get a bottle, I just am really stunned by how beautifully accurate it is. I personally would perfume myself with church incense everyday and now I can. 8/10"", 'Spot-on Catholic church frankincense and myrrh. Smells just like the thurible smoke during Benediction.

I have been on the hunt for Avignon for several years. Where I‚Äôm from it was hard to get hold of. Gradually, I got my bottle of Zagorsk (which is beautiful scent in its own right) from the branded boutique, but already settled on the idea that I will never own Avignon as they claimed it discontinued. When I discovered a bottle on one beauty server, I snatched it immediately. And boy - as incense lover, I say - this is it: ultimate churchy incense - without any further adjectives. This is the smell of catholic church, period. I would not call it sweet or dry, it is just intricately authentic to what you expect to smell (and if you are like me you also look forward to it) when you sit down the church aisle during Holy mass. Very different from Casbah (quite green, spicy and piny) or even Cardinal (linen note makes it somber, almost macabre for me - it smells like a funeral gown or maybe priest robe - both pretty kinky connotations). Get it while you can - it is the reference incense, a must-have in any collection. Projection and longevity are not virtues of this CdG line, yet this is intimate perfume, contemplative piece that you wear for your own pleasure, not to impress others (unless you‚Äôre into priest/sinner confession role play or dress as Exorcist during Halloween).', 'Sweet and heavy, predominantly myrrh. This reminds me of Protestant churches more than traditional Catholic Cathedrals. It sort of holds back with a Puritan sensibility. It‚Äôs relatively dry and simple. There is no additional embellishment.  There is a subtle smoky incense in the background. Some vague floral sweetness.  It‚Äôs pleasant but if Myrrh is your preferred note then surely YSL Opium covers that base.  Avignon veres feminine in my opinion.  I think they could have really created something amazing because the theme is lovely but its not for me. My brother said ‚Äúit smells like dusty old bookcases‚Äù.', 'I really appreciate the artistic part of Avignon. From creative point of view this is a piece of art. BUT.

Despite my husband asking, ""Do you REALLY want to walk around all day smelling like a Catholic Church?""...I LIKE this fragrance a lot...I really do! I am not so sure that smelling like a church is such a bad thing-smile.  Yes, this fragrance totally, 1000% reminds me of the frankincense and myrhh, slightly floral aromas of the incense used during High Holy Mass. There are smoky, musty, musky, dark, mossy, fern-like notes with a wee-bit of vanilla along with incense throughout the duration of the scent. Something in the mid-notes and dry down make this scent a bit more harmonious with my chemistry than Messe de Minuit. I did sneeze after applying both Messe de Minuit and Avignon...but I think that goes with the territory...pretty strong opening notes! I like the idea of a fragrance that dares to be so different and unique. I like this scent a lot...not sure if I could love it...not sure I am ready for a full bottle at such $$$$$$!

I'm also a big fan of incense centric scents; Sahara Noir, Gothic II, Ambre Sultan, Cardinal, Vento nel Vento, etc. I think you get the point. What sets this apart from all of those is the calming, slightly soapy note of the chamomile. It's also a bit creamy and balances out the dry, smokyness of the fragrance. Considering what companies are charging for fragrances these days, under $100 for 50 ml of this masterpiece is a bargain in my book. I'm 4 hours into wearing and it's going the distance.

The opening is absolutely distinctive with an intense explosion of severe frankincense and myrrh, almost harshing but incredibly fascinating. The catholic church effect is pushed to the limit and persists during the drydown while camomille provides an extra dose of mystery and warmness smoothing the general harshness. Cedarwood and Iso E Super are clearly remarkable throughout but they're never overdone. A meditative scent that surrounds you with its intense warmness and deep resinous allure. As a trendsetter, Avignon became one of the most imitated straight forward incenses of the last 10 years (Heeley's Cardinal, Mark Buxton's Around Midnight, Biehl's MB3, Montale's Full Incense).

I was also completely enthused by the idea of smelling like an old, damp cathedral somehow. Well, I thought this would be extremely experimental and basically unwearable, but turns out I feel very at home wearing this. It's almost as if it had some sort of protective aura, enveloping you in a cocoon of comfort. A scent that manages to be both mystical and alluring - I basically smell like a sexy church (apologies for the blasphemy) and I'm pretty ok with that."", ""Avignon has become the reference incense for fragrance enthusiasts, and its hard to deny that compositionally it is evocative of a thurible swaying amongst the devoted in a Catholic church. It is a bit more than that, though, as it has elements that make it more impressionistic, more a perfume than purely a novel incense facsimile. We are not talking Demeter here.  Chamomile in the top note through the heart, lends a certain ineffable quality that reminds of its use in Aromatics Elixir, soothing and almost imparting a 'pastoral' feel that contrasts with the stark, stony chill of the olibanum and elemi overdose. The top, with the coniferous, spiky Aldehyde C-12, also lend to this chill that is soon warmed as myrrh, labdanum and what I can detect as cistus (the oil from the leaves rather than the resin of the Cistus ladanifer). In spite of the Iso E Super that lifts everything, Avignon is to my nose impressively imbued with naturals. The mildest shade of animalic, dry vegetal ambrette musk in the base makes for a really comforting skin scent in the dry down.  I now realize that this will be in my collection as not merely as a reference, but a true joy to wear. The cold yields to warm throughout its development, making it not quite as linear as has been suggested by others, and it surely suits me to a T during this snowy day in New England."", 'Comme des Garcons Series 3 Incense Avignon, a fragrance I affectionately call Old Church. Pretty much what everybody has said, it smells like the incense at an old Catholic church. In other words, it smells awesome.  The longevity is 12+ hours and projection is huge. Every time I wear this, my wife can smell the incense from rooms away. Not a huge compliment magnet, but it will get notice. I do wear it to church and hear some people mention they must have had incense at an earlier service. Funny. 10 of 10.', ""Does church incense smell this... fake? I remember saving up for this for such a long time on an enthusiastic blind buy. I quite enjoy challenging scents and have many years' experience with real myrrh, frankincense, and benzoin. I'm sorry to say that Avignon didn't remind me of any of them. It was just a shrill, chemical cheesegrater to the nose. I've noticed negative reviews get very few balloons here on fragrantica -- but hopefully at least one person will benefit from my experience. In my research to discover why I hated what so many others enjoyed, I discovered it might be a genetic thing. I've heard response to ISO E Super is genetically determined, and my neurology just knee-jerk rejects it. If I may bring up a sensitive topic, ISO E Super, the base of this perfume, is a cause for concern beyond taste -- it is highly toxic to aquatic life, and it is biocumulative. I think it would be rather tragic if a person, in their quest for a spiritual beauty, befouled the water that gives us all life."", ""Compared to other frankincense-like perfumes I've sampled, Avignon is the weakest when it comes to sillage and longevity. That might not be a bad thing, since frankincense can be awfully sharp. I'm not sure I would want it at full blast anyway.

When I see olibanum, myrrh and incense as notes in a scent named ""Series 3: Incense"" I expect some serious incense. I really don\'t get that here. Yesterday I wore Moresque ""Aurum."" That myrrh note wears combat boots! This fragrance is incense for beginners with no experience with incense, because if you\'d experienced any truly incense-forward scents, you\'d find this very weak by comparison. Not ""churchy"" in any cathedral or temple I\'ve been in, unless they have a special mild incense for the childcare area.  Nearly every scent that uses this ""everything and the kitchen sink"" approach (15 notes employed here) you get something pleasant but very non-descript and underperforming. The only exception I\'ve found is Penhaligon\'s ""Sartorial"" with 24 notes. I\'m confident I could pick it out from Nabeel\'s ""Master Perfumer Series"" like ""Al Bashiq"", which employs 44 notes. It\'s almost universally a mistake to formulate a scent that way. Can anyone actually distinguish one Jacques Bogart ""Silver Scent"" from the others? This Comme des Garcons scent comes across to me like that. Doesn\'t take a master perfumer to dump in everything you have on the shelf.  This is certainly safe for any use because it\'s simply not that potent, and it\'s pleasant, but makes no lasting impression. It\'s a non-performer that fades away before lunch, doesn\'t draw any notice or compliments, and at $120 that\'s disappointing. Won\'t be a bottle buy for me.']"

I do however get a damp woody nuance from the base, which is probably where the connection with Azemour comes from.  I do get instances of a bit of a rubbery sharpness, and prefer Azemour overall, because it feels more nuanced and radiant.

After reading others reviews, I gave another spray in the air and do get a much more initial bright citrus opening, but far more fresh cut grass. After some time on my skin I do get a slight spice note like cumin or cardamom. Later it\'s a faint tomato vine vibe. Even while writing this, I don\'t feel I\'ve sprayed anything on.

For me, BC conjures up the image of the Italian countryside in the summertime, complete with orange trees and horses. BC opens with a mouthwatering, photorealistic orange note. Zesty, juicy and tart, it smells just like the real thing. As it develops, the orange is joined by herbal, grassy notes, before softening into the background. The hay note is a great addition - it really complements the other notes and adds warmth. I only get the merest hint of rose, and some soft spiciness. It becomes woodier as it dries down, fading to nothing within two hours.  Unisex but masculine-leaning in my opinion, BC is a simple yet high quality cologne with some points of interest. It feels like an Herm√®s scent - I get similarities to Eau d'Orange Verte and something akin to Terre d'Herm√®s too - but as Jean-Claude Ellena created these and more as Herm√®s in-house perfumer, maybe it's to be expected.

I knew nothing about perfume at the time, and the sales associate sprayed this for me after I mentioned that I liked citrus. It was fantastic - the orange was super fresh without being sweet, and was backed up by a great earthiness and warmth from the hay and cedar. The citrus is bitter yes, but definitely not tart; so fortunately it did not smell like any kind of cleaning product. A cozy earthy orange, where the warm base supports but does not overpower the bright top. Very unisex and approachable, and ultra sophisticated without being formal at all.  I still have that old bottle, and as it is running low, picked up a newer one recently; yep it's changed. Whether due to time or reformulation or both, there are subtle but distinct differences. 2012: opening is bright and bitter, but not sour, orange; almost greener at the opening in comparison to the newer bottle. The warmth from the hay and cedar is present and comforting, while the bitter orange hangs out on top for a pretty decent amount of time. Longevity isn't insane (especially not now in the winter), but is still pretty good IMO.  2021 bottle: opening is definitely sharper. The earthy warmth is less present initially, but after a little time, the overall profile gets mellow and hazy in a way that the older bottle doesn't. There's almost a powdery feeling to it (perhaps the rose?), and I don't really get the hay. There's still some wood at the base, but it's less distinct to me. The citrus is there as it dries down, but it's cocooned, and gets a bit softer and a tiny bit sweeter as time goes on. Doesn't stay as distinctly citrus nearly as long as the older bottle.  Overall I do like both, but I absolutely do prefer the older one.

I have found just one way to stretch the beauty of this out a little longer - spray BIG, but getting most of it on your clothes.

Its a shame because the opening almost had me convinced this would be a replacement to Orange Verte, which by the way is 3X times cheaper."", 'It smells cumin with touch of citrus splash but very fresh and uplifting also. It reminds me of Declaration from Cartier which is created by same Perfumer, Ellena. Bigarade Concentree is really good perfume in my opninon and if you looking for something creative alternative for summer, you should go for this fragrance. Very good and somehow sexy!', ""The review below is one way of looking at it, some could gush about the subtlety of these perfume, neither position is right or wrong, meaning I shall remain firmly perched on the fence about Bigarade Concentree. It has the romantic simplicity of Ellena's compositions and his typical style is written all over this. Opens really lovely, with a wonderful orange note, juicy, zesty and green. It proceeds to get slightly more of a bitter orange feel it, then a very faint hint of cumin. Cedar is about the only other note I get, maybe some of that hay is what is creating the grassy/dry/spice of cumin? and coupled with the bitterness of the orange it's a really good combination. I love the smell of this perfume, however is it worth the pricetag and with poor lasting power? Not for me, but if you want the exclusivity of a JCE creation on FM's imprint rather than Hermes or similar then I get why you might want it. UPDATE: How bloody interesting hey? Look what I said above only in 2018? I own this now and I would say that Malle creations are something which stay with you, and make an impression even if it seems as though they didn't at first. I'm not sure why? Is it the careful curation and contrary to my closing comment (above) the fact that Malle gets the best out of his perfumers? I mean JCE has made plenty of citruses but this really is Iconic. I think my description above is pretty bloody spot on, If I do say so myself. I'd maybe say that the listed 'hay' note really comes into play in this and works so well. I love it."", ""It's ok... nothing that special. For the price, the performance and complexity isn't there."", ""A nice fragrance. Probably the nicest citrus fragrance I've smelled. That said, this is probably the most basic, plain, unsophisticated Frederic Malle perfume. It's not a typical citrus, in that the perfumer tries to have a green base for when the citrus burns away, but the green base is a single layer, rather than the multiple layers of other Malle perfumes.  The perfume does not last long - only a few hours, which makes the price extremely excessive. Furthermore, I wonder how short the cologne lasts is the concentree lasts only a few hours.  Overall, it's nice and pleasant, but simple and short."", ""Discovered Bigarade today, and, upon the first encounter and opening, it reminded me of Terre D'Herm√®s Tres Fraiche.  However, the comedown is vastly different: Bigarade settles into a warm, honey-like sweetness that's very ephemeral yet somehow equally persistent. Tres Fraiche, on the other hand, strikes with very heavy woody notes that often give me a headache if not worn at the right time (high humidity, too warm weather, etc.) Would love to add it to collection at some point, although the longevity somehow feels underwhelming. I can't tell whether this is the typical Ellena factor‚Äîwhen you can't sense the scent, but others around you can‚Äîso I'm hoping that I'll find a bottle at a price that is more suitable for a short-lived fragrance like this one.  That said, I really enjoyed it. Captivating and very lively."", 'Not too pretentious, yet not too simple. Good fine and elegant citrus and I really like the smell on the dry down nonetheless I expected more projection on it. Agree with the previous reviewers in the signature of Ellena on this one and similarity with other of his creations, but I like the Bigarade Concentrate a bit more. Price wise I don‚Äôt think is worth it only because of the performance, but I really love the scent.', 'One of the best citrus-forward fragrances I‚Äôve ever come across. Many orange-based scents go for the sickeningly-sweet approach via the orange blossom. This focuses on the aromatic rind; no blossoms, and never sweet. Instead, it‚Äôs warm and understated, with that ‚Äúsweat‚Äù note which this scent shares with D√©claration and which is always safe, never skanky. Love it. Basically, this is D√©claration with orange added. So obvious it was the same perfumer.  But alas, those two scents also share a common problem: no staying power. Perhaps things are now better with the new parfum version of D√©claration, but I doubt if Frederic Malle will ever release a more potent version of Bigarade. A shame, as this is a first-rate scent.', ""Fragrance -Bigarade Concentree Frederic Malle Bottle from - 2015 Bigarade Concentree is a transcendent,glowing,sparkling and  not made by humankind interpretation of orange with a bit juicy,crisp,bitter,natural,fresh and citrusy opening notes of bitter orange with a wisper of romantic rose.It's the feeling you get when you escape from the darkness of the night and find the joy of the early morning summer sun.Soon enough,soft and a bit skanky cumin comes into the game unsuccessfully trying to bring darkness into light.This all leads into a woody,green,creamy and a bit spicy base with soft,citrusy and moderatly bitter orange sneaking at the edges.In my opinion,this is one of the best orange based fragrance.

It is a citrus but sweet and dry/bitter at the same time. The hay, grass and rose combine to give it an odd quality with a vintage vibe.

Wouldn't want a full bottle or wear it regularly but definitely interesting to sniff."", 'One of the most perfectly orchestrated classic citrus colognes in my opinion. It\'s extremely simple but something about it stands out above many others that are similar. The citrus notes are bright and realistic but remain soft and warm while at the same time remaining fresh and sparkling. That Jean-Claude Ellena Hermes style is apparent but it\'s softer, more ethereal, more introspective and quiet. This is a soul fragrance, perhaps it\'s the hay, but something about it gives me that relaxing feeling that you can only get out in the country, away from everything, and at one with nature.  I still haven\'t purchased a full bottle and I\'m not sure why. I think I found it too ""simple"" for the price. And it doesn\'t last very long, even the concentree. But basing it on nothing but scent alone, no other factors involved, for a citrus cologne I would rate it 10/10.', '6/10', 'A pale, juicy cologne in the classic style (ie. citrus). Top notes of freshly peeled orange with a soft powdery-ness from the rose. Seems like it would be excellent for hot, humid weather as it has Ellena\'s signature transparency lightness - it probably projects better in heat and humidity than in the cool air conditioning I\'m in right now. Fresh without being cold or ""aquatic"". After reading previous comments I realized what this reminds me of - Bvlgari\'s Eau Parfumee au The Vert, at least early on in the dry down. I definitely enjoyed it but I don\'t really get why it\'s so highly regarded. To each their own I guess.', 'Bigarade C. Ellena is a fragrance, has a clear link with Terre, especially flanker eau Fraiche three or Declaration. To Ellena, the privilege would always carry citrus and other fruit notes in partnership, the rest is not so important as it was happening to his master Roudniska, especially compared to male citrus type Eau Sauvage. In this case, bitter orange in ripe fruit version is attached to the note of a sharp and fresh grass privilege takes this combo produces that similar to lemon feel that you have been disenrolled excess acidity and is cleared very cleverly the cleaner, disinfectant and soap ground, falling thing most of this family of fragrances. He is accompanied by a mild note of very natural rose, which clarifies, illuminates and brings glamor, like those brush strokes watercolor gouache likes so much. Cedar drying hay is in third plane without relevance since it is only used to prolong the effect of fruit start and cause the solar effect on the fruit shriveled when dry. We are not facing ""Bois Farine,"" but the work of a great perfumer is not questioned.

It is not sweet, a bit dry, but still gloriously mood lifting. Trust me when I say this: For a citrus(notes include Bitter Orange, Rose, Hay and Cedar) this is a very complex fragrance, there is more going on that just taking the notes verbatim as we see them on paper. No run of the mill, linear citrus frag here- yet it us linear in certain aspects, but not as you\'d expect given the note composition........... The heart is well balanced and developed which is what one would expect from a frag resulting from the nose of Jean Claude Ellena! His DNA is all over this one and IMO, he takes it a step further in another later creation (which I\'ll touch on later). This fragrance has a lot of presence and staying power..... One KEY point: This is one of those VERY VERY RARE fragrances that actually smells BETTER as you you to-and-fro than it actually smells on your skin.......... The sillage is magnificent! Better put on your glasses frag community, because this is a 3D masterpiece........!  My only caveat is this: for those of you who NEVER put your nose to this- There\'s a soft cumin note that creeps in and out during the dry down... For some, this evokes memories of the jock older brother who has a morbid fear of the shower and finds it funny to stick his smelly armpits in your face after working out..... If that aspect of this fragrance scares you away - then don\'t even bother...., because some of you will have an aversion to this ""body-odour"" aspect of the frag..... The solution.... Please try by any means possible to get your hands on Bvlgari Eau Parfumee au The Vert Extreme....... It\'s EVERYTHING this is- less than controversial cumin note... He substituted it for coriander I believe and it\'s a much mire palatable note- IMO...', 'All I had to notice was THE NAME: Jean-Claude Ellena! Nothing more needs to be said!

I can hear the distant chatter of my grandparents having breakfast in the terrace. The thought of fried eggs with persian sangak bread has my stomach rumbling so I jump out of bed to indulge. As soon as my breakfast finishes I ask my grandfather to take me to the park and play football with me. He smiles and tells me to get dressed.

He unlocked the door and I walked into the front yard where I got soaked many times while commandeering the water hose that we'd use to water the plants. I walked through the rooms where I used to play hide and seek, past the empty shelves that were once filled with my grandfather's books, and finally reach the garden. I saw the orange trees, still standing tall. I reached for a fruit and cut it open with a knife. I first smelled the orange, and then my hands. The scent was just as I remembered it. This is that scent."", 'I\'m usually not into citrus fragrances but This one is a standout. The opening is absolutely amazing with a ""desweetened-candied"" orange note that is one of the best around joined in a while by a moderate rose note reinforcing the scent and giving it some complexity and depth. The drydown is quite austere and woody but still very comfortable. Bigarade Concentr√® is one of the few perfumes in which I can stand the Rose note. it\'s functional, kind of an orange adjuvant and never dominating or overwhelming. BC has all the JC Ellena hallmarks and for a few aspects it made me think of an expensive and precious prototype of Terre. Marvellous. Rating: 8/10', 'UPDATE: having purchased and worn it for over a week, I have an enlightened take on this frag: Jean Claude Ellena\'s use of the Seville bitter Orange extract is like NOTHING you\'ve ever experienced: The opening of BC is fresh and life-like, right away you pick up the bitterness- which is altogether expected considering it\'s NOT blood oranges we\'re dealing with as with Atelier, Le Labo or other houses. It is not sweet, a bit dry, but still gloriously mood lifting. Trust me when I say this: For a citrus(notes include Bitter Orange, Rose, Hay and Cedar) this is a very complex fragrance, there is more going on that just taking the notes verbatim as we see them on paper. No run of the mill, linear citrus frag here- yet it us linear in certain aspects, but not as you\'d expect given the note composition........... The heart is well balanced and developed which is what one would expect from a frag resulting from the nose of Jean Claude Ellena! His DNA is all over this one and IMO, he takes it a step further in another later creation (which I\'ll touch on later). This fragrance has a lot of presence and staying power..... One KEY point: This is one of those VERY VERY RARE fragrances that actually smells BETTER as you you to-and-fro than it actually smells on your skin.......... The sillage is magnificent! Better put on your glasses frag community, because this is a 3D masterpiece........!  My only caveat is this: for those of you who NEVER put your nose to this- There\'s a soft cumin note that creeps in and out during the dry down... For some, this evokes memories of the jock older brother who has a morbid fear of the shower and finds it funny to stick his smelly armpits in your face after working out..... If that aspect of this fragrance scares you away - then don\'t even bother...., because some of you will have an aversion to this ""body-odour"" aspect of the frag..... The solution.... Please try by any means possible to get your hands on Bvlgari Eau Parfumee au The Vert Extreme....... It\'s EVERYTHING this is- less than controversial cumin note... He substituted it for coriander I believe and it\'s a much mire palatable note- IMO...', 'It takes incredible restraint to remain civilized around this scent - I want to roll around in it like a dog on a particularly compelling patch of lawn. I NEED this smell on me. Bright, bitter, spicy, salty, funky. Lime peel rubbed over sweaty armpits in the best, most addictive way possible.', 'Is there a cheaper alternative to this? It‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous but outrageously expensive for what it is.', ""Beautiful and pure fresh orange scent. I love it for 30 seconds and it's gone. Way too light a fragrance for me. Too bad, as my bottle is signed by Fredric Malle personally. It's a great fragrance for a lighter skin type do not want something imposing. Great for the office."", ""Just a sour, pungent armpit note. That‚Äôs all. It's horrible"", ""A very weird, unique citrus. It is a citrus but sweet and dry/bitter at the same time. The hay, grass and rose combine to give it an odd quality with a vintage vibe. It's not trying to be Shalimar but is that kind of classic weird citrus frag. Not floral is projecting. Interesting. Wouldn't want a full bottle or wear it regularly but definitely interesting to sniff."", 'A friend had given me a decant of Cologne Bigarade because it didn‚Äôt suit them. I really liked it, apart from its absolutely non-existent longevity. I finished the decant and moved on. Then, somewhere along the line, I had read that this was basically the same fragrance, only stronger. ‚ÄúHow wonderful!‚Äù I thought to myself. And on paper (like, when sprayed on literal paper) yes, it is exactly that. Really lovely! Citrusy-tart but not ‚Äúfruity‚Äù, summery and green, really easy going‚Ä¶ not life-changing, but still, really nice! Ugh. But when my skin is thrown in the mix‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, man‚Ä¶ there is something in there that is absolutely wretched on me. There‚Äôs just like, a *tinge* of something that‚Äôs gone off, or B.O., or even like‚Ä¶ something ever-so-slightly wet-diaper-adjacent. An undercurrent of something very rank. I dunno. Maybe it was just me? Maybe I just smell? Maybe I got a bad bottle (is that a real thing?)? It‚Äôs expensive and this kind of fragrance is usual enough that I‚Äôm willing to just cut my losses, but yeah, kind of a bummer!', ""All I can smell is the caraway which gives me the body odor smell.

I discovered the champaca flower on a trip in Indonesia (they use it a lot for offerings and also for massage oils, incense etc.) and completely fell in love with that flower smell. I was hoping to find that same sweet, almost honeyed nectar smell but this perfume is actually really green. I would agree with some reviews and say it‚Äôs a green fresh floral perfume. It‚Äôs soft and not offensive, but not what I was looking for, it‚Äôs missing some punch and some sweetness in my opinion. I‚Äôm not a big freshie girl, and even tho I still find it soft and clean-shampoo smelling ( I think it could work for some occasion where you want to smell fresh and feminine), the longevity and sillage are not great so I don‚Äôt think it is worth it.', ""I really don't like it on me. When I test it, I can smell sth very fresh, peppery and citrusy. Little do I smell any flower. For me it's like a cleaning product and it gives me a headache. Do not recommend buying without testing."", 'Ormonde Jayne Champaca is a light, sheer scent based around the tropical white flower known as Magnolia champaca, said to be the tree under which the Buddha achieved enlightenment. The flower has a swoony, tropical, narcotic, almost fruity scent, but here it‚Äôs treated in an ethereally fresh and subtle manner, with clean green notes in the opening, and a dry green-tea background hum, as well as some milky toasted rice in the heart. This is actually as much a rice scent as a champaca scent. It makes me think of a shady tropical verandah. Deep in the drydown there‚Äôs a spiced, sticky note that I assume is the myrrh, making this into a mild floral-rice-pudding dessert. It‚Äôs all very polite, and I can usually take my white florals quite a bit bolder than this; I‚Äôd love to try a full-bodied, epic champaca fragrance sometime, with all the nectar-dripping indoles intact. But I can‚Äôt really call Ormonde Jayne Champaca ‚Äúboring‚Äù either. The sticky rice note is unusual, as is the green tea; there are no cliches here. This would make a really great bridal fragrance, I think. White florals have the kind of lush femininity that goes well with the one day in your life you‚Äôll wear a poofy dress, but this one is light and transparent enough not to offend a crowd of guests.', 'I tested this in a perfume boutique without looking at the notes first. I had no idea what champaca was at the time. It smells really fresh and clean and has a wonderful balance between green and slightly floral. I should have known when I fell in love with it that it also has a tea note, because that seems to be my favorite lately. This is absolutely full bottle worthy and I will be reaching for it a lot this spring.', ""8/10 i consider this more freshie than floral, which i love. if i was to put the accords on fragrantica from my perception - it would fresh, then maybe green (bamboo, tea, and neroli feel green to me), then floral i love freshies but a lot of the notes used in them can be super screechy and headache inducing to me. i feel like this is the first freshie to actually work for me completely! this one feels very natural, and gentle.. and its also so feminine without the typical sweetness or fruitiness you might expect from a feminine fragrance. its refreshing without being citrusy, or bracing but if you're trying this for the first time - make sure to let it dry down. because with the neroli and pink pepper in the opening, it was too sharp and spicy for me. but after about 5 mins, that faded and the gentler notes started to appear.  the tea and rice note really make it stand apart. i often find tea notes to be too bitter - this is not! just fresh and gentle. forgive me for using the same words over and over  i think the rice is what helps to round this out, and smooth any harsh edges that you also sometimes find in freshies.  i was surprised to see moderate longevity and sillage in the votes on here. for me so far the performance has been pretty poor, but i dont mind because i love the scent. it turns into a skin scent on me after an hour or so. if i want to smell it on myself without putting my nose to my wrist, i just re-spray throughout the day every few hours"", 'Blind bought a while ago and I had no idea what to expect. I have to say, the more I wear it the more I like it. It‚Äôs fresh without being citrusy. It‚Äôs like a smooth, elegant freshie and I really like the rice note. Makes it more unique.

Just random flower notes, no rice.', ""Ormonde Jayne Champaca is a very pretty, fresh, shampooey scent. It's the opposite of annoying or overwhelming and you could probably safely wear it around all but the most scent averse folks. To me, it's in the same genre as Gucci Bamboo, Calvin Klein Truth, and the classic Elizabeth Arden 5th Avenue. While I definitely like it, my tastes run more toward more perfume-y perfumes, in general, and if I'm in the mood for a fresh, shampooey scent, I'd just as soon wear CK Truth or the slightly more perfumey EA 5th Avenue, both of which are incredible bargains, to boot."", ""Save yourself about $250 and buy yourself a bottle of Elizabeth Arden Green Tea.

I don't really notice the musk but I think I get a quick whiff of the pepper."", 'Beautiful blend, a tad too sweet for my taste . I love the bamboo and rice and how it blends with the neroli. Though imo theres a lot going on and doesnt let the champaca shine !', 'A transparent bright and light fragrance consisting of almost equal amounts citrus, light florals and tea with the green tea being slightly dominant to the other notes. It‚Äôs quite linear and fairly short lived on the skin, with a moderate sillage. The lemony magnolia perfectly mirrors the citrus notes in this and there is very little contrast or drama within these notes, it‚Äôs a smooth as glass and pretty fragrance that will appeal to anyone that likes the Asian style of much more restrained, refined, and minimal type scents. Although I like this I will probably gift the travel spray I have to my daughter who loves Versace Bright Crystal. I feel like this one is kind of in that family, that light sparkling style of pretty and inoffensive scent.', 'Just recieved mine and I have to say this is stunning. It opens up warm, a tad green (due to the bamboo), spicy and fruity. Suits the summer season perfectly.

I had higher hopes based off the notes like rice and tea but got a very generic 90s clean floral smell through and through. Opens with a very strong bamboo note and a hint of rosy pink pepper.

It initially opens with a contrasting combination of soft neroli and sharp pink pepper, before the champaca itself becomes present which is sweet and a bit fruity.

However, I‚Äôm not sure how you can really vote for the notes of bamboo and rice, who even knows what they smell like?  Overall, this fragrance is very pleasant on the nose - gentle, clean and inoffensive while still remaining fairly interesting. For me though it‚Äôs simply too weak, disappears very quickly and isn‚Äôt very memorable unfortunately.', 'Opens with a bamboo and a peppery freesia, then calms down to creamier florals on a safe musky base. The faintest champaca possible (really just an undistinguishable florals for me), not in a good way - really underwhelming composition.

I have a sample of this from a set that I will happily enjoy, but I don't see myself buying a bottle of this. Edit: After revisiting this a year after, it's actually quite grown on me.

The projection is nonexistent so this makes an excellent bedtime fragrance. This is a sweet and creamy yet fresh floral fragrance. This fragrance smells good but it is so generic and bland.

I heard so many good things about this brand so I was excited to try some of their fragrances.

Has the screechy freesia note from Lanc√¥me's Miracle combined w/ Champaca and green and spicy notes. Very strange combination and not a true pretty floral. This is a unisex floral, very unisex actually leans masculine. Why can't Niche companies make real feminine floral perfumes? Even the perfumes I like from this brand lean unisex. All except Frangipani. If you want a pretty champaca floral that will not let you down and really smells like champaca but has a sweetness of nicely balanced fruity notes and a pretty lactonic and soft spicy dry down, try Jean Patou's Sira des Indes.

Initially I get a wonderful hit of champaca and neroli, which rapidly dissipates into a vague powdery scent (rice and freesia, I assume). After several hours I begin to get whiffs of champaca again. Unfortunately, the bitter and spicy elements I love in this perfume don't even linger as a skin scent - I have to shove my nose into the clothes I'm wearing to get any of the tea or myrrh.

I highly doubt anyone else in the building will be wearing it when I do! I have family members that can be overwhelmed by scents/perfume but this does not bother them. This is one of the few perfumes I own that truly feel like they can be worn year round, day or night. To me it doesn\'t lean super hard into a season or situation and is what I put on when I don\'t know what to wear.

This has a crisp, pink pepper-green bamboo opening. Maybe a touch of Neroli at first but on me neroli mostly stays in the background.  After about an hour, the pepper fades and the sheer, dewy magnolia heart emerges. It\'s well-blended and has a bit of fullness, perhaps from the basmati. Basenotes are soft, a little sweet and a touch fruity, which I didn\'t expect. I thought I wasn\'t going to like the musk/myrrh/tea base, but this is really quite nice. It has a smooth quality similar to sandlewood, but a bit sweeter. As florals go, this seems fairly unisex. And on me it does not warrant either the ""sweet"" note or the ""amber"" note in its pyramid.', ""At first wearing of my little sample, I swear I could not smell it on my skin. I had applied unscented lotion after my shower, so perhaps the lotion absorbed it? On second try, with no lotion, I could detect it and it is fantastic! Fresh, green, woody, spicy. In the drydown it gets a little sweeter and more floral. It's a very light, uplifting and comforting fragrance. Could wear this anywhere, anytime.

I think the rice note smooths the edges. My nose can\'t really pick the notes apart, it almost smells watery and fresh but it doesn\'t cross the line like you would expect others in that category to smell. I read other reviews below calling this ""generic"" and not very remarkable, don\'t let those influence your choice to try this. Its delightful. I find it extraordinary, I don\'t find many florals I can\'t live without. I find most florals, especially white florals too loud and screechy, that is not the case here. Even though it\'s an eau de parfum, this scent on my skin pulls in close after first 1/2 hour and stays there for 4-6 hrs. It is a bit pricey but I bought the biggest bottle so that I may reapply at my leisure.  On a side note, I was on a quest to find a gardenia scent I could enjoy. And although most say they smell nothing alike, my mind and nose is satiated currently. This is a beautiful scent. Addendum: I\'ve been wearing this more frequently since obtaining a full bottle and I was wrong about longevity. It lasts at least 8 hrs easy, wafting in and out and on textiles it lasts for days.

Relatively this is a bamboo forest - bright green on top and musty and pale brown and green on the bottom - with little white flowers and a clean stream of water running through it. Beautiful and it achieves what it is trying to do, without being dull. It's just not my favorite scene."", ""Ormonde Jayne's are outstanding; you must recognize that they're so well constructed and so well blended, that you can even justify the steepy price for those fabulous little bottles.  That said, Champaca is not my favourite of the line (so far, this prize belongs to Tolu & Tai'f and second best, Woman) but without doubt this is a masterfully done floral. Quite prominent on the initial notes (read: it is strong), I can smell white flowers, orange blossom, Jasmine and Champaca, Tiar√©, Magnolia - while I do not get neither the basmati rice nor the green tea notes.  Probably the flowers are a bit overpowering... The base is resinous and musky.  It has a better staying power than the other frags in the line.  As I said it is not my favourite, but it is surely an unusual floral that deserves to be tried at least once."", ""Too much freesia for me. Champaca OJ smells fresh, floral and perfumey.

So I got one of the 8ml Travel Lab sets, Champaca was among the ones I wanted to revisit and turned out to be one of those 'Me in a bottle' scents.

I do enjoy it, though."", ""Champaca is head and shoulders above the smellalikes listed, but it's fair to say it does share similarities with some of the shampooey, fruity, ozonic fragrances from the early 00s, at least in its dry down. It's very nostalgic for anyone who discovered fragrance for the first time in the late 90s, like I did. It specifically smells like something I wore to school, which had a pearly bronze plastic cap and was in a round bottle, and cost about a tenner from Boots.  However, it's done very well. Incredibly balanced, with a delicious fruity heart and a pleasing halo of soapy, clean white florals. This is a very beautiful scent - definitely on the feminine side - which would suit a Gen-Z barefooted bohemian in white cotton as much as an older CEO or TV presenter.  I enjoy the fact Ormonde Jayne florals are so wearable. Yes, they are expensive, but often I shell out on a niche fragrance that in the end is a bit too odd, quirky or difficult to wear often."", 'I have three perfumes with champaca in them, and they are all unique: I Miss Violet by The Different Company, Sira des Indes by Jean Patou and Champaca Absolute from Tom Ford. I have travelled through India and parts of Souteast Asia where champaca is native, but am unaware if I have ever come into contact with the real thing, though I am sure I have. In perfume, champaca has this distinctive buttery, waxy smell to me, and it‚Äôs lightly spicy. Each of the perfumes mentioned above uses champaca in interesting ways. Unfortunately Champaca by Ormonde Jayne is the least inspired of the perfumes I have tried with champaca. I can pick out champaca, and it‚Äôs blended well so that nothing else is obvious, but I don‚Äôt care for it. There‚Äôs nothing exotic or intoxicating in this blend, and I don‚Äôt have an answer as to why.  Not a down vote but it is a pass.', ""Perfectly good treatment of the note - but IMHO not as inspired or as lovely as many others from Ormonde Jayne, and some of its other white/yellow flower scents (Frangipani, Sampaquita) seem a bit more ebullient and special to me than this one. Champaca can be seriously strong - even overpowering - but while the usual OJ seasoning of pink pepper and extra notes does calm things down, and keep the whole mix from cloying, it somehow doesn't get all the way to the opulence I'd expect for OJ prices. For me, for once, this treatment is less long-lasting and a little less impressive than CDG's Luxe Champaca. Really down to skin scent only in only 2 or 3 hours and only the most discreet whiff of loveliness thereafter. Still borderline unisex, but about as femme as OJ scents really get. So not out of this world, but then, a mediocre Ormonde Jayne is still more excellent than many other houses' top-of-their-game winners. Polite applause, but not a wild screaming fan club, for this one I think. ETA on another wearing on a crisp cold day: no, I was wrong - this is great! Really strong, convincing pepperiness makes it both richer and pricklier, more exciting, than many an over-sweet go at the note - the bamboo and tea also coming across more clearly. Still not the very top of the house's game but really intriguingly spicy, teasingly herbal, and convincing throughout. Longevity also stretched a bit further in the cold, oddly - going pretty strong for 4-6h."", 'A beautiful and delicate fragrance. Such a shame that it is so fleeting on me. Within a couple hours it is gone entirely.', 'This is a lovely perfume but not OJs best. I think I would have been more excited about it had it not smelled exactly Lubin Jardin Rouge.', ""Disappointing.  It smells like a wrapped paper grocery bag with lemons, orange, tea bags and wafer bars inside. You know - paper, wafers, tea and lemons mixed together. Very long lasting.  It bears some resemblance to Eau De Rubylips. I don't know champaca's fragrance, but once I had champaca essential oil and it was very very similar to Truth by C.Klein (wax-y green, tea like, masculine). And Champaca by Ormond Jayne is more kitchen-type of scent."", ""I used to grow Michelia champaca before I moved, but I didn't care for the fragrance of the yellow flowers as it was very strong. This perfume smells nothing like it and is soft and lovely. I currently grow the white flowered version, Michelia x alba, which is a amazing fragrance, which I would love to see captured in a perfume. This is nice but not full bottle worthy to me. The longevity isn't great as I could barely smell anything on my skin a couple of hours after applying."", ""This has an awesome scent like true to life daffodils. I suppose champaca smells like that. It smells like you're smelling the flower itself. However, sillage is weak while longevity is only moderate. Also, it leans very feminine. 3.5/5"", ""I am surprised at the negative reviews. This is hands down my favorite perfume and I could just bathe in it...It is a unique combination of fragrance that I have never smelled anywhere else before. Also, I am very sensitive to most popular commercial perfumes and sharp smells, and get headaches easily, which means I can't wear most perfumes for more than an hour. This one is just divine. It has a warm, creamy, well rounded floral / fruity feel, with a fresh scent of pepper / bamboo thrown in somewhere to pep things up, but is definitely not too sweet or cloying. It is a bit of a warmer, heavier perfume for me, so I tend to wear it in the winter or in the evenings. Sophisticated, layered, lasts a long time.  Other perfumes I enjoy and can tolerate are Il Bacio by Borghese, Chloe (though the powdery finish is a little too old for me) and my day to day favorite, Versace Pour Femme - which is also a warm rounded fruity floral, but on the lighter, elegant side, so I wear that to work."", ""This is a calming, comfort scent to me and I truly love it and douse myself in it on hot days. Primarily it smells like a toasted nutty rice tea, with a citrus twist. The floral aspects don't really stand out to me on their own, but may act more as a watery floral tea essence. It's soft and light but lasts quite a long time on my skin. I'm so curious about the Cacharel Noa Perle now! Too bad it was discontinued because I'd blind buy it just to compare."", ""Don't believe the votes; it's more like a (bamboo heavy) minty tea."", 'Champaca has been my go to scent for a very long time. This perfume suits all occasions. Somehow this manages to be mildly sweet, but green and refreshing floral with good lasting power. I love this and also Frangipani from the OJ line.', ""Agree with other reviewers who have noted this as a safe scent. I don't find safe to be disagreeable though. I love this one for springtime, and quiet or low-key events like a friend of a friend's house party or memorial service. Something were I want to wear scent, and want to keep it light, pretty and unique. I haven't smelled much else like it. I find it to be one of the more ethereal fragrances in my collection.  I do agree that the pink pepper can be intense, but I have not experienced this every time, just once when I wore it to work (maybe it had strange interference with the HVAC system? who knows with these things!)."", 'I love champaca, frangipani and ylang ylang but these are demanding, loud hothouse divas that need to be handled with care. I think I can say with some confidence that this exists here in OJs olfactory translation of this potent note. The myrrh and tea really compliment this diva by taming her with a touch of smokiness and dryness so she doesnt holler too loudly. Once again pepper, neroli and freesia add the pepperiness the act like accents to this three dominating notes. Towards the end the myrhh and tea stay to the end of the performance. Its very nice but again weak like many of the OJs creations on me.', ""I've had a 10 ml decant that has lasted forever because it never made me want to reach for it. It's nice. That's about it. I want something that I want to waft every once in awhile...that I adore. This isn't it."", 'I bought 5 samples from Oromonde Jayne and this is my least favourite of them. It\'s not an unpleasant perfume - in fact it\'s very nice - but it\'s just so boring. I struggled to have any kind of reaction to it at all.  It opens with a blast of pink pepper, then it becomes a fruity floral with a nice touch of bamboo. It\'s hard to say what the florals really are. It\'s more just an approximation of ""floral"", like you get in many mainstream perfumes.  The bamboo is nice, it offers a lovely greenness to the composition.  I can\'t say I really get anything in the way of champaca or freesia. To me, this is orange, pepper, \'floral\' and a hint of bamboo.  It\'s nice, it\'s safe and it\'s not in any danger of offending anyone, but it smells like every other mainstream fruity floral out there, except it costs twice as much.  It\'s a great crowd pleaser, it would make a great celebrity perfume. And I\'m not saying there\'s anything wrong with that because there isn\'t at all. It\'s just the price that\'s the problem. Niche comes with an unspoken promise of something a bit different. We\'re told we\'re paying for the higher quality ingredients, and that may be true (but let\'s face it, often isn\'t), but what we\'re really shelling out for is to not smell like everyone else. We want something a bit different to what\'s readily available from mainstream perfumes. This fails to offer that.  Soft sillage and 8 hours longevity.  Perfectly nice, but you could easily find something that does the same thing at half the price.', ""First, I must admit that I know nothing about the scent of champaca- but one thing is for sure-someone used a really heavy hand with the pink pepper shaker on this one- to the point where any easily discernible floral notes are almost completely obliterated- although I think I smell some freesia, maybe...  I get some sour citrus notes here, too- reminiscent of Serge Lutens' Nuit de Cellophane Fortunately, the scent softens a little as it enters the heart phase, and the longevity is admirable for a niche scent"", ""CHAMPACA = ECLAT D'ARPAGE (Lanvin) + PEPPER + NUTMEG?? Upon first spray, i was immediately reminded of Eclat d'Arpege. You know, that creamy & crisp sweet lilac + green tea combo. This impression lasts for about 5 minutes then i get a whiff of bright sparkling pink pepper. Then I detect a sweet jammy pear with nutmeg and soft incense notes. At one point in time I get a really beautiful orange blossom note peeking through, but not quite strong enough to throw off the sweetness. One hour later I get fresh figs, soft suede leather, peppercorn and stewed fruit. At this stage it reminds me of a fruity pipe tobacco (perhaps my favourite part of this perfume, unfortunately this phase is rarther short-lived). The changes are subtle and the perfume stays linear and close to the skin. The main theme is a slightly spiced Eclat d'Arpege. CHAMPACA is very soft and never harsh, with average longevity and low sillage. It is not bad but certainly isn't FB worthy. While being finely balanced, it lacks the inspiring and intriguing qualities which are often expected from niche perfumes."", 'Doc Elly called it, ""the elevator music of the perfume world.""

I put it on, got busy with things, and completely forgot about it. By the time I remembered that I had it on, it was more or less gone, so the only thing I can say is that, to me, it‚Äôs a not very memorable floral that only lasts a few hours - the perfume equivalent of elevator music.

It reminds me of a fresh, green, tea-infused soap in the opening. Very expensive. Very rich. Yet very relaxed and natural. The slightest whiff of powder turns up midway, mingling with a sultry floral. The fragrance actually seems to change on me, becoming warmer and earthier, even a bit smoky. It's comforting and beautiful, but for whatever reason, it does not awe me. It smells faintly of something else, but I cannot put my finger on it."", 'My primary experience with champaca has been in the form of extremely potent soaps with which I was scenting my drawers (some of them may still be there, but the smell no longer wafts up everytime I walk by!) Given this experience, I donned Ormonde Jayne CHAMPACA expecting a pretty hard-hitting oriental perfume. Instead, what I have found is a soft, creamy, light floriental with a perfect dose of champaca on initial application. CHAMPACA opens beautifully with a scrumptious melange of creamy rice, light champaca and green tea. I would adore this perfume if only this stage lasted. Alas, it fades all too quickly, leaving behind only the faintest layer after an hour or so. The composition is truly gorgeous but all too shortlived... It would be nice to try this creation in perfume concentration.', ""I was so excited to try this as I LOVE Champaca. The Ormonde Jayne store is SO hard to find too but I did hehe. This is slightly underwhelming for me. It's slightly spicy to me, in the way that carnation is spicy. This has that spicy/floral this going on. It's also fresh and slightly masculine, bit of a weird one and I wouldn't say..beautiful..it's spiky!  I was hoping for something more complex than this as this was the first Ormonde Jayne scent I've smelled.

I read other reviews below calling this ""generic"" and not very remarkable, don\'t let those influence your choice to try this. Its delightful. I find it extraordinary, I don\'t find many florals I can\'t live without. I find most florals, especially white florals too loud and screechy, that is not the case here. Even though it\'s an eau de parfum, this scent on my skin pulls in close after first 1/2 hour and stays there for 4-6 hrs. It is a bit pricey but I bought the biggest bottle so that I may reapply at my leisure.  On a side note, I was on a quest to find a gardenia scent I could enjoy. And although most say they smell nothing alike, my mind and nose is satiated currently. This is a beautiful scent. Addendum: I\'ve been wearing this more frequently since obtaining a full bottle and I was wrong about longevity. It lasts at least 8 hrs easy, wafting in and out and on textiles it lasts for days.

Very clean smelling and surprisingly approachable with a particularly pleasant sweet creamy soapy woody accord alla Dechafour, no coffee though, as far as I can smell.

Kyoto gives me pause and I can feel it in the air around me, it places me somewhere calm."", ""I have a longer review praising this below, but I want to update on 2 things.  One is just how fresh this is for a woody incense fragrance. It's got a light, soapy, clean feel that is just as prominent as the woody and incense components. I think it makes it a great daytime fragrance for when you are looking to have some meditative zen to your day without being too chilled out. It's uplifting and energizing without being shouty, aggressive or too business like.  The other is the performance. A lot of the notes in this are subtle and sit close to the skin by nature, but there are some aromachemicals (that I must be sensitive to) that project big time in the first hour, and linger for 12+ hours on skin, and days on cloth. Whatever is producing the sharper, clean side of this is also behind the strong performance.  I think performance complaints come down to how sensitive one is or isn't (or completely anosmic) to some of the molecules in this. I know iso-e super is in it, which causes noseblindness for some, but the performance for me is on the strong side.  Your mileage may vary, just be aware!"", ""This is a wonderful take on Japanese incense, in that it smells EXACTLY like what Japanese incense smells like, or, the incense they recommend to you in butsudan stores, even when you say you're looking for something a little less generic. It's the smell of incense sticks gaijin get offered ALL THE TIME, and there is NOTHING wrong with them at all, I love these and have HEAPS of these already, but it's the smell that Japanese incense stores THINK foreigners want to smell. It's so weird, and a little bit frustrating. The equivalent of being taken to a western fast-food chain when you're in Japan, but I digress... This scent has all the hallmarks of Japaneity, and more specifically, how Japan expresses itself in a select type of incense -- woody, green, demure, not flashy and not obnoxious. There is a LOT more to Japanese incense than this, of course, as much as this might shock Japanese customer service staff, but it does tick all the boxes at the same time. The hinoki gives off a green-woody element that forms the backbone of this scent, and whilst the smoke is a big part of the architecture here, it is NOT the first thing that hits your nose. So, in closing, yes, this reminds me of incense in Japan, but the kind of incense they shove at foreigners almost all the time..."", ""This is one of the greatest incense fragrances I have ever tried. The meditative incense combines beautifully with the crisp cedar and grounding vetiver, they sing together. Overall it's a very atmospheric fragrance and I feel like it creates a kind of a cool, calm and collected aura around the wearer. But at the same time there are some sultry notes in the background which give it a sexy and seductive edge. Longevity is also good for me, especially on clothes.

It‚Äôs supposed to evoke a Japanese temple but I find its woody incense notes come across like a really nice shaving cream‚Äîmasculine but not aggressive. Combined with the hint of coffee, the vibe is that you‚Äôre a guy who has a beautiful apartment in Kyoto (maybe your high rise has a view of the temple), tastefully furnished in Danish teak modernist furniture. Your stereo system is hi-fi; you make your coffee in a Moccamaster; you have a subscription to Monocle. You‚Äôre waking up on a sunny day in a great mood because your creative projects are coming together just as you planned. You‚Äôre excited to get to work.', ""I'm biased toward CdG Kyoto as it was the first perfume I bought. When the notes touch my nose I'm overrun by waves of nostalgia. It opens with a sharp cypress note, which has that slight touch of bitter citrus peel, amber and incense. It is restraint; it invokes peace. What's impressive is how it's fresh while harbouring an underlying mystery, like stumbling upon an abandoned temple in dense pine woods. After a couple of hours the sharp cypress is toned down for warmer incense notes, but by this point the fragrance has already begun its retreat. This is where the frustration sets in. Kyoto's composition deserves more staying power to match its subtle, meditative ‚Äì even masterful ‚Äì\xa0opening. The only solution is to take a meditation/spray break every four hours."", ""Opens up with mostly incense and cypress while maintaining a soft woody cedar base. Everything is really well blended however, I don't catch any other notes listed as to me this is pure green woody incense. smells fresh and perfect for more colder weather.

A ritual that reminds us that life is fleeting, that all things must come and go, that nothing is ever permanent. Kyoto is a similar exercise. A meditation that evokes the same feelings of peace and detachment. A piece of art that allows us to bask in its beauty, but only long enough to realize how much we will miss it once it's gone.  Like the monks, let us not be disappointed by what was lost, but rather remember: what is most important is embracing the beauty in the present. The beauty of the moment.

Like the smell of a fresh stick of incense after taking a warm shower on a cold, rainy day. Simply stunning. As it dries down the woods and incense both really start to really fill out with addition of dry cedar and clean vetiver. In the deep dry down you get a very small twinge of dusty immortelle to help backup the cedar and vetiver once the cooling incense and freshness has disappeared. I wear this when cleaning my house, hiking, or just need a grounded, calming vibe. Truly a one of a kind woody fragrance that is easily one of the best fresh & woody fragrances on the market right now. It‚Äôs so easy to wear, and while I wouldn‚Äôt see myself reaching for this on the hottest days; this freshness of it helps with work very well in the heat (number of sprays permitting). Truly stunning and a must try if a fan of the woody or incense genre, or just stepping foot into the genres. A top 5 for me. 10/10. Masterpiece. Signature scent worthy. Song vibe - Timeless by The Weekend and Playboi Carti TLDR - Clean, cooling, fresh cypress, incense, and teak wood mixed with woody cedar and vetiver.

I would say that Kyoto is much sweeter and where Avignon has a lit incense with a lot of smoke, Kyoto is more unlit incense.

Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, there‚Äôs smoke‚Ä¶ but not as much as Avignon. This fragrance is very nice.

There are notes some people mention that I don\'t detect at all (menthol? pine?) and there are other notes I detect that I don\'t see represented here (there\'s a quite prominent floral note that isn\'t immortelle that I can\'t pin down, maybe some general synthetic ""floral notes"" component?), but I also find this to be quite feminine. I enjoy wearing it, but it\'s not what comes to mind when I refer to something as unisex, probably because of this soft floral note. This is also the character that separates it most distinctly from Avignon in the same series of fragrances, and that scent *is* purely unisex in my experience of it. Both are gorgeous but Kyoto has a bit more longevity than Avignon. Kyoto has a ""wet"" impression that feels very distinct from the ""dry"" impression of Avignon. As a consequence, Kyoto feels only vaguely reminiscent of incense to me while Avignon, by comparison, clearly conjures that experience of walking into a dusty chapel where frankincense was burned an hour or two before I arrived.', 'another incensey cdg fragrance from this collection', 'All I get is mentholated shaving cream..', 'Fresh and woody incense blended to absolute perfection.

I don't get anything like incense from it and I own quite a few incense-based fragrances (also CdG Incense Avignon, which I love). I find it a bit on the expensive side for what it is, but if you can get a good deal it's certainly worth a try for a simple, fresh/musky perfume that leans somewhat masculine in my opinion."", ""This is a dry cut cedar bomb at the start, then making some room for the patchouli, cypress, and mild incense as it dries.

Very beautiful and zen. I\'ve never truly been in a buddhist/shintoist temple but I am ready to believe this is exactly how they supposed to smell like. Kyoto is a calm brother next to its slightly more performative sisters Avignon and Zagorsk, and the third fragrance from Series 3 that I got. So far all of them were fantastic and I am looking forward to trying Jaisalmer and Ouarzazate next.  As for Kyoto, It mostly reminds me about times spent alone in a forest on a cold rainy day, maybe somewhere close to a sea even. Minimalistic, reflective and composed perfume with a gorgeous incense drydown. It feels like a good thing to wear while sitting down to write a novel in your private cabin at the edge of a forest. A must have for incense lovers.', 'It was the summer of 2010, I was dancing in a club, and a handsome man approached me to flirt. He was visiting from Spain, was arty, and smelled so good. I asked what it was, and he told me it was Comme des Garcons Incense Kyoto. I took him home with me, had a great time, and his scent was left behind. I was so hooked I needed to buy some of it for myself. It became a no. 1 go-to scent for several months thereafter. I loved how it smelled so calm and clean, meditative and grounding. This was such a contrast to the turbulent life that I led at the time, with so much escapism, sleeping around, and untended wounds. I long since ran out and never replenished Kyoto; I am almost afraid it will transport me to that time, and I am not so sure I am ready for that. But I do look back fondly, and can still smell it in my mind.', 'driving to work through the morning rain and fog and wearing a hoodie and i get to my desk and realize i am kind of sweaty and overdressed and it looked colder and harsher outside than it actually was. the dark skies make the inside of any building feel a little bit cozy masterpiece. everyone i show this to loves it. smells like being in a coffee shop while it‚Äôs raining. the incense is so warm and nice', ""like sexy, masculine bug spray. i love it... not sure i would purchase it for myself but i'd definitely gift it to a boyfriend"", ""In terms of the genre that is incense I've had no issue finding wonderful fragrances among the heavier concentrations that offer both complexity and performance, but it's been much harder to find something lighter for everyday wear. What I also didn't want was something that felt like a watered down and simplified version of something that was meant to be expressed in the highest possible concentration. Incense: Kyoto checks all tose boxes for me, but not at the cost of character.  To me the incense here comes across dry, smoky and ashy even. It's the incense molded into sticks and cones, and lacks anything that I would associate with dense, syrupy resins evoking an amber accord. It is certainly green and woody, perhaps a little cold even. It's also quite unique in this line, compared to the other four that share some similarity (a more directly resinous quality). It is a much more meditative fragrance to me, than something that I necessarily only associate with religious rituals or spaces. The distinction is unnecessary, even though it does conjure up my memories of the temples and shrines of Kyoto in the winter. It opens with smoke and birch tar and develops into a smooth, green mixture of cypress and cedar. I don't really agree with most of the comparisons drawn in the 'Reminds me of' section. There is nothing overtly masculine about Kyoto. It is very much a true unisex in the sense that the composition is balanced and harmonious. The vetiver here acts mainly as a fixative (it is literally present in most fragrances, even when not listed) and is overreported in terms of the note pyramid in my opinion. It lasts a long time on clothes, but is not as long lived on skin. But after all, this is kind of the point and something I appreciate, because it enables me to have this meditative scent cocoon around me when something much stronger would be inappropriate. It's not linear, but it also doesn't go through a drastic change throughout its development. It has that same comforting feel about it throughout its entire development."", ""Kyoto is one of my favorites, and is a great example of what Comme Des Garcons does best. Producing thoroughly modern, artistic scents that playfully mash up synthetic and natural elements. Somehow they remain very wearable despite (or because of?) the avant garde leanings, and even though this was made in 2002, it feels completely at home over 20+ years (!) later.  After so much societal turbulence globally, in the form of pandemics, political fuckery, and accelerating technological change, etc. Kyoto remains a beacon of calm that transcends it's time of origin.  Similar to Wonderwood, 2 Man, and other CDG classics, Kyoto has some amazing natural touchpoints, mixing with a futuristic molecular side keeping things from just smelling like a straight essential oil blend. Kyoto leans a bit to the natural side, but there is some airy modern chemistry working some magic here too. It could be completely lab created aromachemicals, but the feeling and notes come off pretty grounded and nature inspired to me.  Without paying too much attention to the listed notes, some themes here are definitely the sweet, damp woodiness mixing with a fresh yet warm soapiness. A meditative airy, Japanese incense swirling around ties these two sides together. Many Japanese incenses are very low smoke and gentle, and that is what you'll find here: low smoke, subtle, nothing campfire, headshop, charred or sooty here. Extremely pleasant and it's somehow calming and cozy while staying uplifting, energizing and clean.  Thankfully, performance is actually way better than expected for me. I think it's easy to go noseblind if you smell this one up close too frequently. I'm able to smell this for days on fabric, and the fresher soapy note and light incense really cuts through the air for me. However, some of the denser woody notes (that are fantastic) sit close from the get go and only reveal themselves upon closer inspection. At no point is this a projection or sillage monster, but I do get solid yet subtle hints of it throughout the day, which I think serves the nature of this conceptually.  The last thing of note, is this is pretty unique smelling, even if the overall concept has been done many times over. I haven't smelled anything quite like Kyoto. Nothing on the reminds me of list comes close, but out of them all Bon Parfumeur 602 has some crossover with it's soapy, incense and wood notes. Not a replacement though.  Hwyl, Hinoki, Encre Noire, Loewe 7, and Azzaro Visit all feel quite different from each other and from Kyoto, although they share a common theme and fall under the same genre. If you love meditative and introspective leaning blends, none of these would be redundant to own as they all bring something different to this very chill table.  While some might find this to be simplistic, I think therein lies the beauty. This one is about the notes not played, and the ample white space left to give room for thought."", 'Oh, boy. It‚Äôs been a while since I felt this disappointed. This fragrance is by one of my all-time favorite perfumers, and it‚Äôs turned out to be a complete letdown. It could be because of my high standards, a natural development after spending so long in the fragrance game, but something seriously went wrong with this creation. I understand that the incense used in Japanese culture differs from that in Oman (particularly in Amouage perfumes), but I‚Äôm 100% sure it doesn‚Äôt smell as bland as this. TOP NOTES Kyoto smells dry, meditative, and serene in the whole spectrum of things. It opens up with the green and fragrant scent of cypress. What I also get immediately from the start is this churchy incense, which I have smelled a thousand times before. Not terrible, but truthfully, nothing that would have made me say, ‚ÄúWow, this is spectacular.‚Äù The best words to describe it would be just above designer level or, better said, bland. HEART NOTES Here, incense continues to play the leading role but is grounded with cedarwood and dry vetiver, which begins to show its face even before the scent reaches its dry down. The notes are well-blended, and to be fair, it does not smell like a cheap and random product. I expected a more exciting development, quickly transitioning into the linear dry down. BASE NOTES As the scent transitions into its base notes, a blend of incense and woods remains. It‚Äôs alright; it can be pretty enjoyable, especially during the fall and winter, when this fragrance finds a fitting ambiance. However, I haven‚Äôt detected any patchouli or amber elements that could have enhanced its complexity and made it more interesting. OVERALL Kyoto was one of those fragrances I didn‚Äôt struggle to decipher, unlike more multi-dimensional and expensive-smelling counterparts. It is what it is‚Äîa simple, calming scent that is highly unlikely to leave you in awe. It‚Äôs suitable for beginners who are just embarking on their fragrance journey. Read the full review at scentgrail.com', ""This was what I thought Le Labo's Gaiac 10 was going to smell like! Although that one was pretty decent, Incense Kyoto has more character to me. In short, this isn't smokey as you'd expect but rather it's more like unlit incense and clean woods. Quite calming and pleasant!"", ""This is outstanding perfume. Other fragrances in CDG's incense series capture typical church incense or uplifting spicy incense, but this is incense for meditation and contemplation. It smells of deep, dark wood with slight floral and citrus reinforcements. Opens with a slight soapy edge and gets darker and woodier as it dries down. This is also the most wearable of the incense series. Instead of smelling like a cathedral or a spice rack you smell like comforting, reassuring wood. I could see this being the daily wear of some sort of classy professional type."", ""Logical but soft, balanced, meditative. Refreshing, deep winter fragrance that leans into a savory blend of woods to complement the incense. In not doing too much, it does everything it needs to. Definitely favorite of the series 3 family I've tried."", ""This one is my favourite of all the series 3 fragrances. It's very unique, relaxing type of scent, that's giving me great feeling when I wear it. Can't wait for colder months to start enjoying this fragrance.

Though they are all pretty dry and bitter (and this is in no way actually a sweet perfume), there‚Äôs something about the coffee, the woods or the immortelle in this that round it out, it even gives me the illusion that I might be smelling a freshly opened bag of aromatic rolling tobacco behind the incense, that sort of sweetness. It truly feels ‚Äúmeditative‚Äù as in it feels ‚Äúsilent‚Äù, I am even getting something aquatic from it which is what gives me the meditative vibe. It also smells the most ‚Äúcontemporary‚Äù of the line, or maybe just more ‚Äúoutdoors‚Äù. I‚Äôve never actually visited a Shinto or Buddhist temple to know if it‚Äôs realistic or why that is but this somehow smells the least ‚Äúdusty‚Äù. Really an all year round scent imo. My favourite one to wear from the incense line.', 'Kyoto is one of my favorite city in Japan and I basically visited there many times when I was living in Asia.My most favorite place is Kiyomizu-dera temple so this incense Kyoto is reminded me of old wooden zen or Shinto temple or shrine that the Japanese monks frequently burned some incense pray and pay respect to the lord Buddha just peaceful,Calmly and quiet when I was there all I can smelled was Pine or cedar wood that they used for builded the temple and lightly smoky incense (which is not that strong compared to incense in Catholic Church )to me this fragrance is breathtakingly realistic and really can take me back to those temples I wish is last longer on my skin.', ""Kyoto is the 'Far Eastern' entry in CdG's Incense series.  It starts off with a mixture of frankincense, cypress and cedar, before the incense slowly reduces to lingering smoke and a vetiver core reveals itself. It's like a slightly more restrained version of Encre Noir, but there are hints of something floral (maybe that's the Immortelle). It dries down in a pretty linear and speedy way after that, so I am guessing, like Encre Noir, that this relies a lot on the Iso-E. But I don't mind that: if it smells good I don't care how it's achieved. PS: A final note to all those fantasizing about Japanese temples and forests, I've spent a lot of time in Japan, and there is nothing 'Kyoto' or even particularly Japanese about the smell so far as I can tell. Imagination is a wonderful thing..."", 'This work is based on Japanese Shintoism. The bottle is dark and surprising in appearance, but it tastes very good. A woody fragrance that fits the theme. It\'s not the smell of a real shrine, but it can guide your mind and make you agree with ""this is Kyoto"", this is Japan. I have tried some of the famous religious works, but Kyoto still has a place. Dust particles of cedar and patchouli, mixed in a mild and round incense, accompanied by a little coffee. The appearance is linear, with all kinds of changes implied in it, sweet, bitter, cool, dry, every feeling is clicked until it is right, and it is closed when it is good. The most direct association of Kyoto should be incense ash and incense sticks.', ""This makes me think of the countryside in the cooler months after rain early in the morning. The incense is not over powering and not the hippie type either. it is fresh type of smoke. there is a touch of clean vetiver supporting this and roasted coffee beans adds a touch of warmth. Not  a coffee that's already brewed to drink. The patchouli is light in this fragrance for those that do not like too much patchouli, Projection is good for the first 4 hours then sits closer but a bit more than a skin scent. Lasting power is 6-10 hours in the cooler months, so guessing summer time this will last more like 4-6 hours. I always use 3-4 sprays on the neck as this is a EDT. Age range imo would be anyone over 25 Pricing of this fragrance is a little on the expensive side, since if you wanted to buy a 100ml bottle and save some money it won't be possible as it is only made in 50 ml bottle. so 100ml of this juice will cost you ¬£130 but still worth it nonetheless.

It's forestry mountain air in a bottle. The incense in this is not the main player- it's distant, calming and slightly cold. More prominent is the woods and greenery. It's photorealistic of a peaceful quiet forest with distant smokiness. None of the notes in this dominate but work quite harmoniously together to create a peaceful feel rather than a specific scent profile. If Encre noir is rolling around a forest floor after a thunderstorm, this is going for a 6 am walk through a pine forest on a cool cloudy day. My issues with this is the performance is terrible. I mean really really bad. I get 20 mins of projection and a total life of around 2 hours. The projection is also minimal. I've seen a lot of people below describe this as a meditative type of scent and I completely agree, but I'm not sure I would like to spend ¬£65 on a 50ml bottle of juice I'll have to get super close to enjoy.

There's a certain restraint and intentionality to Incense Kyoto. It's almost minimalist in nature, there's no fluff or flair.  Can be worn anytime, although I would suggest moderate weather. This performs very well, so a hot day may be too much. We all wear fragrances for different reasons but this is one is definitely for the wearer. Others may enjoy it but this is for a certain headspace. It's contemplative, meditative, natural wood beauty.  Around $95 for a 50ml is a pretty good value. I can see this lasting me at least a few years, one of those I rarely wear but really enjoy when I do. I stumbled upon this one and decided to blind-buy...I'm lucky the gamble paid off. I consider this a gem in terms of 'collection' rather than 'function'. I used to own 2 Man by CdG and it was too strong, that church incense was not for me. If you're looking for incense, be careful, this is almost undetectable in comparison."", ""Super realistic notes - does exactly what it says on the tin. On the sweet side, and very natural. Piney and smoky but mostly a soft, realistic mix of woods.

It absolutely smells like the notes: very strong incense, deep woods like cedar and cypress. As it softens later on, I get some vetiver, patchouli, and amber. It really smells like being in a Japanese temple deep in an ancient forest. However, if you don't like incense, you definitely won't like this one, it is pretty strong. I know other people are saying the longevity sucks, but I used a dabber sample and it lasted 8+ hours easy, with good projection. For me, this is a fantastic scent, but maybe more suited to a candle than a perfume. I love the smell of being in an ancient temple, but I'm not sure if I want that temple following me around all day... My only gripe is that the bottle looks like a generic room spray. For a perfume this price, I expect *at least* a standard-looking glass flacon. In any case, it is different than anything I've smelled before. Do yourself a favor and get a sample of this, it's worth it just for the experience alone."", 'I received a 5ml decant and, with few preconceptions sprayed it on my wrist. Waited...Inhaled.  I‚Äôve never written a review just minutes after my first sprays but I instinctively felt familiar with Kyoto. Like we had been close in another life. I‚Äôve never had this instant connection with a fragrance before, and have enjoyed many. Imagery instantly painted in mind... Dusk. A gnarly cedar forest rises to envelop me, edging a meandering path. The air is cool, still, and damp. A bluish smoke gently billows from deep within the mossy floor and rises to form a peaceful apparition that beckons me to follow, all the while moving further and further away, lost beyond the curves ahead.  Kyoto is quiet, introspective, and calm. I agree with others that it should be be projecting a bit more, but it can be forgiven because this composition is designed to whisper, and does so like a proper ASMR.  I think this fragrance could make almost anyone feel calm and centered. Colour: Spirulina  Song: kiyomizu-dera by Matthew Halsall', ""This is my signature. First whiff and I was in love. This fragrance is like a magical forest in Japan. It's mysterious and is more of an emotion than simply a scent for the office, dates, dinner parties etc. It lasts maybe around 3-4 hours and sillage is very close to the skin. Now I'd like it to project more but I like how it's a skin scent for me personally as I like when I'm in more intimate settings people feel quite comfortable and somewhat intrigued. However, for the price (¬£65 50ml) I do expect more sillage by a tiny bit more at least and more longevity. I feel like this is my signature till it runs out and then I will move on to finding a new one - the price for the performance puts me off rebuying, even though this is one of the most interesting scents I've smelt. I say buy a sample off ebay or something before buying as this certainly isn't a blind buy! - I hope CDG make a stronger version that's worth the money because they have some gems!!!"", 'I didn‚Äôt expect this to be so quiet and subtle. It‚Äôs like a whispering Encre Noir. I‚Äôve put loads on now and only when I smell it millimetres away that I get a spicy, smoky wood. I want more bang for my buck. #NotMyScent', ""- Beautiful soft incense and woodsy fragrance. It's very light and airy like you're in a quiet cypress forest in winter with a small bonfire going in the background."", ""I already wrote a review about Kyoto, but I feel it is only right to write it again, now that I know the perfume better.  This is an amazing fragrance in my opinion. It opens with a light, smooth, gentle incense and cypress. It is very green and slightly damp, unlike say Avignon, which is remarkably drier. It doesn't evolve much, I do get some occasional whiff of coffee and vetiver. Unfortunately I am not familiar with teak and immortelle. Performance-wise, it is light and airy, a bit more than a skin scent, but it does last a few hours on me (I usually do one or two spritzes max). Even though it is incense-based, it is safe to say that most people will like it, I have yet to find someone who dislikes it. Totally unisex. On a personal/emotional level, I love this perfume because it makes me think of dreams. I know it sounds weird, but the atmosphere/feeling of this perfume resembles a lot the atmosphere of my dreams, in their stylized reflection of reality. For this reason, I find it highly relaxing :)"", ""Kyoto still manages to amaze me with its fine smoke, elegant cypress, and its stunning woodsy immortelle cacophony. Immortelle should be ranked higher, which leads me to believe most people don't know what this particular note smells like. It's actually the star of the show here, backed up by incensy teak wood. Refined, elegant, unique, mysterious. In the same vein as Bois Marocain, but distinctive enough to be able to own both. Easily my favorite of the incense line. Overall, this and Wonderwood are simply the best CdG has to offer before you catch on to their repetitive molecule base they seem to want to use time after time again."", ""I sampled all of the CdG Series 3 Incense and Kyoto is the most ethereal, the hardest to pin down but possibly my favorite? Not sure yet but it's very beautiful, light and herbal. Doesn't smell like a perfume at all really, it's so natural."", 'A wooden saisen box at the Shinto temple. Spot on. Well done CdG.', ""Wow, initial reaction was that this is literally one of the best openings I have ever smelled. This is in my top 5 of 50 fragrances I‚Äôve recently sampled. One of the most stunning scents I've ever had the fortune to encounter... quite a bit like of Un Jardin En Mediterranee without the fig and citrus. But thats not where the story ends... Drydown is good but not as impressive. Plenty of Iso E in here, feeling myself getting anosmic as it dries down, reducing wearability for me. The cypress is sharp and a little austere, reminding me in part of CDG Hinoki. I don't get much coffee which I would have loved because coffee with cypress would have been amazing. Composition is simple and linear, making it very zen but a little boring on skin.  Tantalizingly close to a dream scent, but in the end it underdelivered. Cypress is one of my favourite notes after a few years in this hobby. Going to try a lot more cypress fragrances, and compare with Hinoki to find my favourite. Like I said, I love the opening but the composition is very dry and a little scratchy and synthetic with the Iso E and it underdelivered in some areas, leaving me with mixed feelings so I might go with Hinoki..."", ""This is my favorite out of the incense series. It sets the scene for chilly, rainy days in the woods. It's mountainous, airy, clean (but not clinical). This smell came from nature, chopped wood and dew-dappled leaves. It's peaceful, and magical. A hedge witch would wear this."", ""The entire CdG Incense series is fantastic but Kyoto is a real stunner. It's a beautiful floral incense fragrance that has an airy feel but also contrast and depth. It opens with a bright, and realistic, hinoki note. Then it gets a little toasty and warm before merging into a blend of cedar, incense and mountain flowers. I find this fragrance to be quite calming.  It has moderate projection and good longevity on me. It has great lasting power on fabric, and I like to spritz it on a scarf in winter.  The nose behind Kyoto, Bertrand Duchaufour, also created Avignon and L'Artisan Timbuktu. They are all gorgeous takes on incense and worth a sniff if you like Kyoto."", 'Kyoto is another wonderful incense scent from Comme des Gar√ßons. I own Avignon, but over the years my taste has become more refined and I like Kyoto better. Still very linear, but somehow sweeter and softer with cypress being the dominant note. Being an EDT, I get about 3.5 hours longevity with 90 minutes or more projection in the opening. No complaints, and I can imagine even wearing Kyoto in warm weather as long as it‚Äôs sprayed lightly.', ""Absolutely beautiful. I am becoming increasingly afraid I'm gonna have to buy all these bottles. This doesn't read to me like an incense, but that's not a bad thing, I just lack that cultural awareness to know if it is. I've tried Japanese incense before, and I find them to be very unique, herbal-y and green. This is green to a certain extent, but it's more dry, spicy and just plain woody. In the best way possible. I really love this fragrance, it seems to be a bit more powerful than Avignon. While I don't love it as much as Avignon, it does preform better. Overall, gorgeous. 8.5/10"", ""It's difficult to pick my favourite of the CDG incense range; I really do think they're all exquisite, and a few cuts above for mid-price fragrances. But Kyoto is the one I feel I can wear every day, anywhere. I get a very warm, bone dry cypress note with a hint of clean smoke behind it. Cedar can sometimes be too sweet or overpowering for me, but here it's perfection, working in harmony with the other notes. I don't sense much amber at all here, just a hint, and cleaned and tamed to a very gentle whisper. The whole effect is uniquely calming and soothing. It doesn't feel temple-like at all to me (and doesn't remind me of Kyoto), but rather like an abandoned wooden cottage on a warm day-- no heavy church incense, no religious indoctrination, just pure relaxation. I've given Incense Kyoto to a few friends, male and female, as gifts, and all have fallen in love with it- and I must say it's one of the most consistent fragrances in terms of body chemistry; it seems to smell about the same on everyone, and equally seductive."", ""Very linear, very bold. I think it smells just like Terre d'Hermes. Did Hermes and Jean Claude Ellena copy this?"", 'It does not resemble Le Labo Gaiac 10 at all...beautiful in its own way but definitely not a dupe for gaiac 10 Kyoto is a beautiful Incense that is very wearable and not offensive and makes a great first or safe incense scent. The only down side is very little projection and longevity is no more than 2 maybe 3 hours and you have to sniff for it to find it on your skin, it is an Eau De Toilette not EDP afterall so short longevity is expected.', 'Along with the rest of the colossal Incense series, Kyoto remains a landmark release which brought back incense to the mainstream. All were great and moved around slightly varied incense accords (to match different religions). Years have passed since then and the formula has definitely been explored further and improved but the quiddity of the genre is retained. Kyoto is a calm, sophisticated woody-incense that plays a gentle frankincense note along cypress and other discreet woody notes (cedar more prominently) for a stylish, urbane scent. The whole structure relies upon a hefty dose of ISO-E Super which is used cleverly to make the composition breathe for hours. It may seem simple and it is, but it is not simplistic and the idea and drydown although now ordinary when first released were totally novel and profoundly ground-breaking. Terre D‚ÄôHermes, Encre Noir, Bois D‚ÄôEncens, Sycomore and many more modern woody wonders but also countless banal woodies owe a great deal of gratitude to Kyoto, one of the contemporary pillars of the woods category. MASTERPIECE', ""I don't think I can say anything that hasn't already been said. I really, really like Kyoto, but I won't buy it again because it disappears in less than an hour on me. I've heard it comes as a scented candle as well, might go for that instead :)"", ""I smell lots of cypress oil and a touch of maybe smooth black pepper in the incense accord that's blended into the wood accords to give it a sort of a wooden hut in the forest type feel. It's good on top but after a bit I feel it falls a bit flat, collapsing into a slight soft maple syrup skin scent."", 'Wow! The juice is crazy good x5', ""The ingredient list shown above is a vicious deception.It's nothing but citrus scented cough balsam (lemon wicks) Utter disappointment for me and biggest shame for CDG, whose other wonderful parfums we still adore (wonderwood, wonderoud, CDG2, CD2 Man and black pepper)"", ""I was saying to my sales associate that the CdG fragrances cater to their clothing line, and its wearers- that is to say pretentious... hipsters. Not always a bad thing.  Then I sniffed this. Wow. Truly beautiful, authentic. Fascinating. I've never been to Kyoto, but I assume the brand know a thing or two about their land.  This is, at least, a very fun and enjoyable take on incense. A series addition that seems to be focusing more on green notes and pine notes than the presumed incense. Very lovely. A bit of cedar... lots of fir. Wonderful!"", ""This may be the nicest in the incense series. It's a fresh and bright incense, the Cypress note is different from most Cypress, I guess it's the Hinoki wood that's very aromatic. This is similar to B Duchaufour's Timbuktu frag, a brighter softer incense."", 'This is a beautiful light cedar, cypress and Vetiver combo with a smokiness that is light and gives it an airy incense vibe. I think many commenting below have no real experience with insence and therefore have unrealistic expectations. Incense comes in many scents itself, just have a look at the insence the monks from Mt Athos produce. All incense is not going to smell like a Catholic Church, nor is it exclusive to a church. This is a nice quiet fragrance for relaxing at home, or even as a light office scent. It‚Äôs very tranquil. Beautiful creation.', 'The Assassin by Hsiao-Hsien Hou 2015 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Pine forest by IVAN SHISHKIN 1878', 'zesty_calco below has it right on. Woody, but I get hints of stick incense. Interestingly enough, this reminds me a lot of the Nobu in Ceasars Palace in Vegas. I bet they pump in a very similar scent.', ""Soapy incense. A pale, minimalist notion of incense. Very transparent, even for Duchaufour - despite pouring this all over myself this is basically a short-lived skinscent - but the fragrance itself is coolly earthy and a bit soapy. What's funny to me is that this doesn't smell like Japan to me. It doesn't remind of things I smelled in Japan (except maybe a Japanese bath due to the soap note); for that, I'd recommend ELdO's Fat Electrician, which opens with grassy tatami and ends with the distinctive smell of a Japanese bookstore; or CdG's own wood based Sugi or Hinoki. Kyoto does, however, capture the *feel* of Japan; the quiet, meditative, Zen Japan of imagination. Tranquil and restrained."", 'Harmless clean soapy very short-lived incense.', ""Incense, dry woods and maybe some coffee to smooth it out. To my nose this is more of a woody fragrance than an incense. The incense smell in Kyoto has a wood smoke vibe rather than a Nag Champa or Catholic church incense. I can smell the cedar, cypress and vetiver. It does have a peaceful meditative effect. Reminds me of Kenzo Tokyo in many ways but higher quality.  Sillage and projection feel a little weak. Lasted for four hours on my skin before becoming soft. Unisex, more mature and for cooler weather. Kyoto feels a little more versatile because it's a woody fragrance. Appropriate for everything except date night as I don't find it sexy. Maybe it's because I was raised Catholic but I prefer Avignon to Kyoto. For the price I expect this to perform a little better. Still, a nice scent."", ""I need more of this! I want to bathe in it! It does feel calming, but I'm not sure it lasts very long. I wish it was a little stronger. Smells like a temple packed with pencils, sexy pencils."", 'A peaceful and meditative incense perfume. The perfume opens with notes of immortelle flower, cypress and frankincense. It moves to heart of coffee, teak and patchouli. The perfume dries into an ambery cedar. Moderate in sillage and projection, this is a powdery unisex perfume with fair to good longevity. This entire series from CDG is a must for incense lovers. Enjoy!', ""I think some batches are more straight up cypress because sometimes I love it and reminds me of Japanese incense, other times it smells almost boring... That's why I haven't bought one :/"", ""I tried this on today whilst out shopping with my fume buddy and though I grew up going to catholic masses at least weekly, this is not the incense from the churches I frequented! My friend said it reminded him of south east asian temple incense and that made much more sense to me. This is floral, smooth, resinous and woody to my nose, the drydown is warm and enveloping. More meditative than incisive or awakening, a nice wear on a cool winter's day."", ""When I purchased Avignon from the incense series, I thought it's the best one and wouldn't get any more. A review perked my interest and got Kyoto. I like it more than Avignon, growing up Catholic, it feels weird wearing Catholic incense, allthough it's nice allso.  I like Kyoto best because it's more woody. The cedar note is the best making a great woody accord with the cypress. There is a very unique smelling woody note that I never smelled befor, I think it's the teak wood note, very aromatic and pleasant. There is a nice soft grassy note maybe the immortelle. It softens some of the coniferous woody sharpness. So I surely get the incense, but this has more unique aromatic woods than other purely incense frags like Montal's Full Incense. This is something in-between Wonderwood and Avignon, with more softness, a toasted bread immortelle note. If you love woody fragrances and cypress, this a great one. Rating: 8/10 God bless. John 3:16"", '6/10', ""If there is incense out there that smells like this, I'd love to know what it is called because it's lovely. Personally, I've never smelled incense that resembled Kyoto.  I get cypress, cedar, vetiver and something airy/camphoric on top. I'm not sure what that is. Maybe that's a smidge of turpentine mixed in there. I don't get any coffee at all...zero hints of coffee.  Very similar to Hinoki in composition, but less concentrated, perhaps more versatile, with overall airy feel. If you like incense fragrances, you might also like Hinoki too. It has a nice, lasting dose of olibanum."", 'To me, being a Japanese, this fragrance wouldn\'t remind me of Kyoto at all - it is more like ""Kyoto that Westerner would think of"". Please don\'t misunderstand - the smell itself is really gorgeous, but only a bit too floral. I think this is the reason why I don\'t associate the name of Kyoto with this fragrance..... If you would like to reminisce about your trip to Kyoto (or Japan), why not try CdG\'s ""Wonderwood"" or Diptyque\'s ""Tam Dao""? These two are much closer to real ""incense"" smell when you visit old temples. Once again, the smell is really nice - just the name \'Kyoto\' is misleading.', 'I read somewher that Kyoto was smilar to Mary McFadden, an almost imposible to find masterpiece. Not even close. All I get from Kyoto is cedar, vetiver and cypress, no incense, on a modern chemical base. Mary McFadden on the other hand is a true perfume that transports me to an inmemmorial hidden temple.', ""I lived a number of years in Japan and often return to visit my in-laws. I'm used to going to the family shrine (Shinto) for New Year and other celebrations, as well as occasionally to Buddhist temples. All I can say is that CdG nailed the aroma of the incense sticks, which are usually either purple or forest green in color, used at these sites. Of course, the sticks themselves are composed of many different floral and wood ingredients in addition to incense resins.  This fragrance smells wonderful and, even better, it transports me to our family's shrine in Japan. I find it completely unisex. Sadly, however, the performance is mediocre."", 'At first this smells reminiscent of my dads old gillette shaving cream. It smells discordant--a fight between freshness and earthy notes. Something far off in the backdrop makes me feel sick to my stomach. I think it is the coffee note.. I kind of hate this. Funny how something can look so good in theory and then just be a huge mess in reality. I wish this worked on my skin, but oh well.', 'Cool moist cedar and other woods, with just a wisp of sweet stick Asian-style incense. I adore cedar (and for that matter incense), so I\'m loving it. And I bet if I think of this as ""the scent of the spirit woods in Avatar: the Last Airbender"" (the awesome animated series, not the movie everyone hates), I\'ll love it even more.', 'Growing up Catholic, I am not really with the whole church incense as a fragrance to wear. This is far from it as it should be, as Avignon takes care of that quite well. This is a nice wearable great smelling fragrance. I think the coffee, teak and patch really come together and make magic. This is my favorite incense from the line 9/10 Great and highly recommend!', 'As a Heeley, Avignon, Tauer incense lover this is a bit light in comparison. All the notes are evident, save for me, the immortelle and amber which are really in the base at a very low pitch. The fragrance is exceedingly light, airy and like the reviewer below me, I could not even smell it at first. I thought I was completely anosmic to the scent so it may be that the cedar and woods are super Iso E though it\'s not heavy or irritating. I like the scent. It is not a scrubber. To me it\'s more of a cedar/woods/cypress hint of incense scent and I\'ve got Serge Lutens Cedre for that. So this is ""faint praise."" If you want to smell of woods, a very light whiff of smoke with the steam of bitter coffee, a forest of cedars and cypress, a cool mist running though it all, you may like. I enjoy it, but don\'t think it\'s my first incense choice, but it is calming rather than opulent and seductive. As a reference, I\'m glad I have a large sample. Longevity is moderate and silage is close to the skin even after heavy application (so very low and light).', 'Wasn\'t initially certain about this one upon receiving it in a sampler pack of ""Incense Fragrances."" To me, Kyoto wears more like a straight Oriental Floral versus an Incense fragrance. Despite not being what I expected and as time wore on, I grew to adore this scent. It\'s funny \'cause upon application, I essentially smell nothing, really...blank space...it\'s odd. Within a few minutes, a blanket of pine forest grassy green takes over, which isn\'t at all my thing. Soon afterward, a combination of resins, amber, vanilla, some smoke, woody teak, etc rises...but not a lot of incense. Frankly, the wafts of smokiness managing to rise are almost offensive...ashtray like. But the hours and hours of dry-down are my favorite development. On me, Kyoto morphs into the sweetest, subtlest resinous woody floral one might imagine. The fragrance is almost ethereal and meditative. Wafts of amber, teak, sandalwood combined with everlasting flower play for hours...some patchouli. Truly the beautifully balanced sum or combination of the parts is what works for me. Not yet certain but this may be full-bottle worthy at a cost of approximately $95 for 50 mls (1.6 ozs). Surprisingly, I like this fragrance a lot. In many ways, CdG Kyoto reminiscently reminds me of Serge Lutens Vetiver Oriental, a fragrance I loved \'til it was discontinued (may be in reproduction).', 'ÿ±ÿ®ŸÖÿß ŸÉÿßŸÜ ÿπŸÑŸâŸë ÿ£ŸÜ ÿ£ÿ±ÿ≠ŸÑ ÿ•ŸÑŸâ ÿ¨ÿ≤Ÿäÿ±ÿ© ŸÜÿßÿ¶Ÿäÿ©ÿå ÿ≠Ÿäÿ´ ŸÑÿß ÿ™Ÿàÿ¨ÿØ ÿ£Ÿäÿ© ŸÖÿπŸÑŸàŸÖÿßÿ™ÿå ŸÅŸÑÿ±ÿ®ŸÖÿß ÿ™ŸÖŸÉŸÜÿ™ ŸÖÿÆŸäŸÑÿ™Ÿâ ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿπŸÖŸÑ ŸáŸÜÿßŸÉ ÿ®ÿ≠ÿ±Ÿäÿ© ÿ£ŸÉÿ®ÿ±ÿåŸàÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿ∑ÿπÿ™ ÿ£ŸÜ ÿ£ÿ≠ÿßŸÅÿ∏ ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿπŸÇŸÑŸâ ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸÑŸàÿ´ÿå ÿ•ÿ∞ ŸÖÿß ŸÖŸÜ ŸÇÿµÿ© Ÿàÿßÿ≠ÿØÿ© ÿ£ÿ≥ŸÖÿπŸáÿß ÿßŸÑŸäŸàŸÖ ÿ™ÿ¥ÿπÿ±ŸÜŸâ ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿπÿßÿØÿ©‚Äù  ÿ£ŸÉŸäÿ±ÿß ŸÉŸàÿ±Ÿàÿ≥ÿßŸàÿß ŸÉŸäŸàÿ™Ÿà / ŸÉŸàŸÖ ÿØŸä ŸÇÿßÿ±ÿ≥ŸàŸÜ / ŸÖÿ¨ŸÖŸàÿπÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿÆŸàÿ± 3 / ÿßÿµÿØÿßÿ± 2002 ŸÉÿ´Ÿäÿ±ÿß ŸÖÿß ÿ™ÿπÿ¨ÿ®ŸÜÿß ŸÇŸäŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿ´ŸÇÿßŸÅÿ© ÿßŸÑŸäÿßÿ®ÿßŸÜŸäÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ™Ÿä ÿ™ÿ™ÿ∂ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÉÿ´Ÿäÿ± ŸÖŸÜ ŸÖÿπÿßŸÜŸä ÿßŸÑÿµÿ®ÿ± ŸàÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ£ŸÖŸÑ ŸàÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÉŸÖÿ© ÿå ŸÉŸÑ Ÿáÿ∞Ÿá ÿßŸÑŸÖŸàÿ±Ÿàÿ´ÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿ´ŸÇÿßŸÅŸäÿ© ÿ≥ÿßÿπÿØÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿµŸÖŸÖÿ© ÿßŸÑŸäÿßÿ®ÿßŸÜŸäÿ© ÿ±Ÿâ ŸÉŸäŸÉŸàÿ®Ÿà ÿ®ÿ™ÿ£ÿ≥Ÿäÿ≥ ÿØÿßÿ± ŸÉŸàŸÖ ÿØŸä ŸÇÿßÿ±ÿ≥ŸàŸÜ ÿå ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÇŸäŸÇÿ© ŸÑÿØŸäŸáŸÖ ÿ£ÿ≤Ÿäÿßÿ° ÿ™ÿ™ÿ≥ŸÖ ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿ∫ÿ±ÿßÿ®ÿ© ŸàŸÑÿßÿ™ŸÇŸÑ ÿπŸÜ ÿπÿ∑Ÿàÿ±ŸáŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿ™Ÿä Ÿäÿπÿ™ÿ®ÿ±Ÿáÿß ÿßŸÑŸÉÿ´Ÿäÿ±ŸàŸÜ ÿÆÿßÿ±ÿ¨ÿ© ÿπŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ£ŸÑŸàŸÅ.

A fresh, pleasant smell, sure, but it doesn\'t fulfill the brief. The incense -a fizzy, transparent, \'laundry soap\' variety found in Heeley\'s ""Cardinal"" and Fueguia\'s ""Misiones""- is too clean and metallic, with not enough sandalwood or smoke to sell the \'Japanese temple\' idea. The wood notes also have a synthetic feel, with none of the outdoorsy ruggedness I was looking for. I don\'t smell any immortelle or coffee either. It\'s just too safe and lacking character. After an hour, all I can detect is a sweet, watery dill note and some pencil shavings. Definitely the weakest in the line. At least ""Jalisamer"" has some bite to it.', 'Sweet, airy, soft incense. Serene and pretty; no smoke, no harshness, just cool calmness. This is enormously nostalgic for me: it smells just like the 90s in that clean, fresh, androgynous style that CDG itself embodies.  It is the most feminine of the Incense Series, and softly floral. It feels powdery blue, like the pale sky in the background of Japanese landscape prints. I tend to like my incenses more, uh, incense-y than this and I would wear it more as a soothing, clean, skin scent than an incense. But, it is lovely, and eminently wearable.', ""I'm not sure why it just posted this under a guest account, but let's try this once more with feeling :D The opening of this scent is gorgeous.... all sharp green cypress and vetiver, like having a steam sauna in an extremely fragrant forest. However, the opening gives way to a combination of cedar and patchouli with the volume turned up too high, and the smoky dryness I tend to associate with good incense gets a bit lost in the pile of hamster bedding and head shop sweetness. It feels unbalanced to me, and the middle section would be better if both of these notes were a bit more subtle, and worked in better harmony with that delicious opening. I don't smell any coffee in this, and as a chronic insomniac, I can usually detect even a molecular level whiff of coffee(in raw or roasted/brewed form) at 50 paces. Thankfully, this doesn't have a lot of longevity, and by hour three it had dried down to a pleasant, if a touch simple spicy wood. This isn't a bad scent, and it is made of quality materials, but I did not get nearly as much incense or Japanese influence from this as I would have liked. More of a posh hunting lodge sort of vibe, to my nose."", ""I received a sample of this yesterday and immediately fell in love. If I'm going to find a signature scent, this must be it (I thought..) I get a prominent sandalwood note, like a lighter, airier version of Tam Dao. I haven't yet checked if they have similar notes, but it does remind me somewhat of Ormonde Jane woman, except much more sheer and subtle. Perhaps it's the green notes, I'm not sure. As many have said before, it's incredibly grounding and calming and just beautiful. BUT...five minutes after application it's gone. Nothing. Not a whisper of a scent remains, even with my nose pressed hard against my wrist. This has seriously put me off buying a full bottle as it's fairly expensive. I notice others have said the sillage and longevity are pretty good - perhaps my sample is a bit old? Has anyone else has this problem?"", 'So wonderfully green. Not that sharp grassy green that usually scares me away, but fresh, rich, and well rounded with the coffee, amber, and immortelle notes. Not sour, very lightly sweet cypress that seems *almost* minty. Not too smoky/ashy either. Refreshing. Very beautifully balanced and quickly becoming one of my favorites. Can be worn any time of year. Very unisex and universally delicious.', ""wow...this is *almost* five star this scent. almost. the vetiver is just a little too strong for my likes. vetiver mixing with the cypress makes it a little too green for my tastes, but all that considered, it's an awesome scent. lovely...reminds me of 'my time' in japan. the traditional houses are made of hinoki (ones built around temples/shrines) and they smell kinda similar to this scent. it's marvellous, i ALMOST love it. i just wish it was less green...8.5 / 10..."", 'Kyoto is a very spiritual soft perfume. You feel a suspension of time . . . all of the notes seem to have their edges smoothed out. The incense is there, but an underlying sweetness saturates the woody accord - almost floral but muted. It reminds me of an exotic sachet I used in the past. As I opened my drawers a lovely soft scent would drift up. Kyoto has that delicate otherworldly presence. Lasted about 3 hours on my skin.', 'Opens sexy and mysterious but the dry down is just warm/fresh spicy and rather boring', 'Im not sure if its just the fact that everyone that reviewed this was looking for a incense smell, or maybe I just had bad skin chemistry with this scent. But the amount of love for this one is pretty surprising to me.  Again this is coming from someone who has no real bias towards incense or anything just a random guy smelling and trying something else out on a pokemon sorta journey of gotta smell them all, but I wasnt to impressed.  I guess it kinda reminds me of incense but I think more so than that, I was kinda was reminded of like... Pet bedding. Like the stuff I used for my guinea pig or hamster when I was a kid. Almost even kinda like walking into a pet store almost. Thats kinda what I thought of lol Anyway performance wise it was light, and I was kinda bummed it wasnt more smokey from reading the other reviews. Longevity was good though. Personally for me I think at least looking at the notes wise or thinking of the vibe of the fragrance a woody sorta bit of green freshness with the cypress some warm spiceyness to go along with sweet aspects.. Well... I think the more recent pure wood does this better.  So ya I guess it was ok, but mostly lost on me myself. Ill have to try it another time.', 'A remarkable frankincense scent. You feel a fresh blast of minty cypress at the beginning. After a while the scent warms up from woods and incense. Then it becomes slightly sourly in the base as vetiver begins to interact more with cypress. With some imagination you can picture Japan (comes from the chosen name by the creators). For me, it‚Äôs definitely a meditatively-thoughtful scent, not for everyday use. As it‚Äôs a classic of incense and a piece of art, it‚Äôs a recommendation for lovers of (somewhat stronger) incense scents!', 'This is probably my favourite scent in the world - it‚Äôs austere and meditative and calls to mind a dark prayer in a cool, shadowy forest temple.', ""Kyoto is the holy grail of the incense series. While the others work masterfully at capturing exactly what it is they claim to capture, Kyoto does the same while still managing to be quite wearable.  This is a sweet, serene, soapy incense that brings to mind Japanese hot springs. It's slightly coniferous and very calming. The incense is far less aggressive here, appearing more like a damp, peppery, wood. A brilliant composition that also works well on clothing. Interestingly, there's a coffee note listed, but my nose is still searching for it.  Great for a contemplative mood, post rain, or simply relaxing indoors. Not only the best of the incense line but also holds its own as one of the greatest Comme des Garcons scents. A masterpiece."", ""Kyoto starts with a clean, well-rounded vetiver and cypress, green and almost electric feeling. i'm not detecting cedar in this at all, though that is probably my own fault as i wear Diptyque's Tam Dao on an almost daily basis. the cypress in this is gorgeous and the vetiver is in no way acrid or unpleasantly sharp. Kyoto allows me to enjoy vetiver without feeling exhausted by it. about 3 hours in the incense started coming through for me. it is a cool, vaguely earthy, floral-ish incense with something soap-like in the background. ever so slightly smoky though mostly dusty with occasional hints of powder (but not powder by western standards.) interesting. i can absolutely see why this is popular, it is grounding and somewhat meditative. this particular blend of cypress stands miles above many other fragrances featuring it. Kyoto is more of a skin scent; it feels very personal. projection and longevity do not seem to be strong points of this fragrance but i actually think that *works* somehow with Kyoto. it is meant to be an unusual, delicate, reflective, carefully timed experience."", 'Kyoto is very artistic creation, one of those rare fragrances that awakes an emotion and takes you places. To me it brought very Zen, calm, safe, earthy feel. Kyoto is woody fragrance - wet forest, smoky burning sandalwood. An Asian temple filled with some smoky, incense aroma and a musty, exotic, woody interior smell, caused by high humidity of the tropics. Somehow all those associations give an illusion of serenity. Beautiful!', ""This is a beautiful scent. The combination of incense, cypress and cedar is very nice and well made. The incense is not that overwhelming as it is in avignon and that is what makes it more wearable and safer. At the start it almost smelled like carots which was kind of funny. Can't decide yet if it's bottle worthy or not."", ""I haven't yet worn Kyoto around town or to work (sure, I'd wear this to work), but my impression of it after a few generous sprays from my new bottle is very favorable. There's a soapy note in the drydown that I like in this; I haven't encountered it much with incense scents. Not to say I'm obsessed with soapiness and demand it of all perfume genres, god forbid. I like some fresh scents but I'm certainly not obessed with them--my obsessions run more to the chypre/oriental genres. But I find the soapy effect in Kyoto interesting because it's surrounded by wafting incense; I like the contrast."", ""Kyoto for a moment reminds me of Encre Noire - because of the cypress note. But it's different in general. It's a mild and smooth incense. Very calming and relaxing(like Quarzazate, but in a different way), cypress and coffee pop out for a moment and I could feel them. Longevity is a little to little for me - around 6 hours on my skin. Possibly will update soon."", 'Yesterday during a semi-formal hotel dinner, I fell in love: There was this heavenly woody fragrance wafting across the table, reminiscent of viking-age Norwegian churches and mountain forests. The source turned out to be a generous perfumista who sprayed my wrist with Kyoto while giving me an on the spot review of all the Incense fragrances from Comme des Garcons.  Kyoto is simply glorious. There is such harmony between the wood and the incense, giving an instantaneous feeling of calm and serenity. Consider it a mental first-aid kit in stressful situations!', 'A lot of smoke and cypress. At times I caught a soapy smell coming from this. Other times I smelled too much Avignon-type incense. Pretty nice overall.', ""This is the one that I had been least looking forward to among the series. I'm not sure what it's missing that the others aren't, but it just doesn't speak to me. The first minute or so is a very bracing fresh wood aroma, but it fairly quickly starts to get older and mustier. For a while, I picture the ancient heavy wooden doors of a buddhist temple high in the mountains, but even that starts to decay into disrepair. After that, it becomes medicinal, like the wood is rotting into dirt rather than being smoky, and I think it's weaker than the others. (Strange, because I remembered it being fairly strong and acridly smoky!) It's not all that bad, but it's just so uninteresting after smelling CdG do the smoke/wood genre a hundred different ways, because I know how good they are at differentiating one from another. It is more organic than the others because of the living dirt/compost aspect, and it does this much less synthetically than other wet, decaying forest floor scents I know (He Wood and its flankers!). But finally by the end, a burning plastic vibe starts to appear, and that really puts the nail in the coffin as far as I'm concerned. Thumbs down because the others set the bar so high."", ""This is a special fragrance! Opens with a mystical chime of fresh cedar and cypress...then Bam!!! It's spiced beautifully with incense and has a slightly earthy quality from the woods and vetiver. This is great but you have to be brave to wear any incense scent and this is no exception. I'm tempted to add this to my collection because it's so unlike anything I've smelled before (in a perfume anyway) it would be interesting to try the Tom Ford which is listed as being similar on here."", 'I searched for the subtle notes everyone else seemed to enjoy but this turned out to be Eau de Irish Spring on me: strong, synthetic deodorant soap. All soap, no incense. Planning my second trip to Kyoto after Christmas. This time I will take more notice of what it smells like and see if I can square the city with the fragrance.', ""Just listen Air - Alone in Kyoto and you'll know everything about this one."", ""All the series 3 Incense is awesome. But each one makes you do a different trip. For this one, this is a relaxing, aerial one. Calm, peaceful, and beautiful. Soft woody base with a delicate incense touch. Less stronger than other like Zagorsk or Avignon, but not in a bad way. This one was made for people who loves calm, intriguing and atmospherical fragrances, whereas Zagorsk and Avignon (I haven't try Ouarzazate and Jaisalmer) are more deeper, earthy and warm."", 'Bought this recently. Agreed with previous reviewers. It is calm and a wonderful fragrance. There is a cleanliness, almost a somewhat medicinal quality a purity brought about by meditation. This is my first step into the world of incense fragrances. I love it. A beautiful fragrance and for me very calm and tranquil, like a tiny haven of peace, a cool forest, a temple, a waterfall or fountain - very therapeutic. Would certainly be interested to try Jaisalmer and some of the other fragrances in this range.', ""This is a amazing perfume. At first it's straight cedar with a touch of incense but in less than a minute the smoke notes begin to be noticeable . They get progressively stronger without ever becoming overwhelming. After about five minutes there is a faint hint of flowers. Basically it is a scent story of starting a cedar wood campfire & as it burns the smoke gets stronger with the smells of nature surrounding you. Oddly the incense which you would think would be very strong in this only shows up on my skin as a faint background note."", ""I am a big fan of patchouli, amber, vetiver and incense. This is a beautiful fragrance, but it's not for me. Kyoto does emanate a nice incense quality of a nice intensity for a few hours, but the longevity was ultimately limited. Your mileage may vary. On the other hand, there was a nice subdued subtlety to this scent, and it may be better to underdo this smoky quality than to over-do-- one would hate to smell like a freshly smoked brisket. This one strikes me as more masculine than feminine, but would be mind-blowing on the right woman, I think."", ""Having travelled a lot in Asia, it's a familiar scent for me. The notes will make you think that it's heavy to wear, well it actually isn't. I get a light flowery incense with woody notes in the background, really nice. The wonderful smell of buddhist temples, made wearable thanks to this fragrance.  Good stuff !"", ""This is a beautiful unisex incense fragrance, with a light floral and slightly sweet edge so evocative of traditional Japanese incense. Possibly a little more feminine than some of the other Series 3: Incense range, but as a man who doesn't mind something a little edgier I love wearing this. A subtle coffee note and cedar add a little backbone and warmth. Perfect for warm weather, or when something a little lighter and fresher is called for without going down the traditional citrus road."", 'The perfume\'s world is amazing,fascinating,glorious and sometimes disappoint us,the latter is not included this one.Kyoto is one of most well blended ever.I had opportunity to try out every Series 3 fragrances as well my desire is to have all of them.If I acting by heart probably I will but my effort consists only ""love"" fragrances.Avingnon and Kyoto are my choice while the former make me feel like all my Sins has been forgive,Kyoto makes me feel like I ever never committed one. In the air notes like incense,cypress and cedar are crispy and full of life ready to be burned,this time it kept ""virgin"" until the end but if you are looking for something more complex take your nose on skin then coffee/patchouli give us smoky sensation,something dark and spicy while surrounded by a little dose of amber,cedar lose its bitterness. Kyoto is a must to try although I`m always looking for long lasting the 5-6 hours in this mood,is plenty enough to my own.', ""The whole Series 3 is, naturally, about incense. But, while it's pretty much clean, pure and straightforward incense in Avignon, in the rest of the series it's combined with well chosen notes to represent the religion or area, and to add a new dimension to the sacred resin.  Kyoto is a well-structured, meditative fragrance, which somehow gives me the feel of Japan even if I never actually went there. Its incense notes are here, sure, and they lead the composition. This juice is incensy, but not in-your-face like Avignon or Jaisalmer. I'd rather describe this scent as a woody one, with two delightfully mannered woody notes, of cedar and cypress, and some vetiver in the background, only to add to the complexity. It is also rather dry scent, maybe even the driest one I've tried, after Encre Noire - which has cypress and vetiver too, but it's really not alike Kyoto. Kyoto is a fragrance you definitely need to try before you buy, but is much safer than, say, Avignon, which I adore but can be quite harsh on someone. Arguably, it's the safest Series 3 composition, along with Ouarzazate, but it blows the orange-lettered one in the secondary aspects, like longevity and projection. If you have no interest in finding an incense-heavy perfume, yet you don't mind if there's some, this thing is the best of the series. It's versatile and wearable pretty much anytime you want to. It evokes the spirit of the East, gives you peace and happiness. A definite must-try.  9.25/10"", 'A soapy incense opening with the smell of fresh clean cedar wood followed by the smell of cypress mixing in with the above. It is very smoky and balmy with a slight hint of coffee that I can pick up every so often though blink and you may miss it. This smells very nice indeed and it actually does smell like a high quality incense stick you use for meditation. Longevity is about five to six hours on my skin and it does stay close to you. Thumbs up!', ""Nice quality incence going on here. It's just a bit on the linear side. CdG has woods/incense mastered."", ""Incense Kyoto was next on my list of fragrances to test after smelling and loving Incense Avignon and Incense Jaisalmer.  I really like this fragrance, however I must say that it is possibly the most masculine scent from this incense series. It's very woodsy, aromatic and surprisingly wet. To my nose, it's the scent of a smouldering fire, with the ashes dampened by the rain. Realistic wood notes, (like the cedar, teak wood and cypress blend found in this fragrance), almost always smell better on a man's skin than my own. I feel somewhat out of place wearing Incense Kyoto, like a woman attempting to cross dress, but doing so unsuccessfully. Although I can detect a slightly smoky incense accord, Incense Kyoto doesn't automatically make me think of burning incense sticks. It tends to be more focused on the wood notes. Both this fragrance and Wonderwood, also by the same house, seem to have a lot in common. I know very little about Kyoto, or even Japan for that matter, so I cannot comment on whether or not this fragrance is a good representation of such an old and established Asian city. However I can tell you that this fragrance does smell good, and is made from quality ingredients. Both the longevity and sillage were impressive, however I found myself less than pleased by the expensive price tag. Comme des Garcons has become quite an expensive brand in Australia. It works out to be much cheaper if you buy through Lucky Scent."", ""To my nose it smells like a a very faint and mellow version of Coriandre by Jean Couturier or Terre d'Hermes. Pleasant but not original, alas."", ""I agree with teddito. At the begining, it smells just like 'medicated patch' with quite strong alcohol. About couple of hours later, I could find some cedar wood, green notes, and patchouli, yet still got medicated patch. This is not exact 'incense' but worth to try."", ""This is on the mellower side of several incense based fragrances I've tried recently, and it is one of the better ones. The incense is soft unlike some sharper versions that I've tried such as Montale Full Incense or James Heeley Cardinal. This helps it blend well without overpowering the other notes including cypress plus just a hint of coffee and other spices. Longevity is good (6 hrs max) but not great."", 'Very distinctive smell, reminds me a lot of a certain type of incense called ""Chandan"", wich is Indian, not Japanese, actually, if you smell the package of the incense it is pretty much identical, and i love it a lot! Very unisex, very good, next on my to buy list for sure! Edit: have it and love it, on my skin the sillage is pretty weak unfortunatly, the first hour it projects amazingly well, but after that it diminishes rather quickly, after 3 hours i need to bring my nose almost against my hand to smell it.On clothes and hair though it stays longer, but on my skin it fades way too quick. i wish it was stronger. This scent is a full 10 for me, it\'s unique (as far as i know), and it makes me happy and calm. This is insence the way i love it, floral, rich and mood enhancing, i\'m totally in love with it.', ""I have all perfumes from the Incense line, and I must say that Kyoto is the most soothing one among all. Jaisalmer being the mystical one, Avignon being the most captivating one, Zagorsk being the charismatic one, Ourzazate being the jarring one, while Kyoto is the calmest one.  It's a soapy wood plus incense fragrance. The sillage is close to skin but longevity is amazing. I think it embodies the true teaching of Buddhism, of which in general is close-to-the-heart and very least outspoken.  Kyoto doesn't necessarily have to remind somebody of Kyoto the city, but I must say it does encompasses the aura of Buddhism in a way that it's a clean, humble, earthy (down to earth), incense (spiritual) fragrance.  And most importantly, you can rest assured that the incense will burn all night long, safe and soundly, in the calmness of the night, reaching to the moon and beyond...  -Mr. Almond-"", 'Oh no. this is absoultly not Kyoto or Buddhism or Shintoism at all. Misleading title on the bottle... Soapy ending reminds me a small unit bath of business hotel in Tokyo.', ""Opens piney, soapy and slightly fruity. I get lot of cedar wood.

If you like Terre d'Hermes, you'll probably like this scent too."", ""Comme des Gar√ßons Incense Series 3 KYOTO is burnt wood incense perfume with a slightly less burnt drydown in which tea appears also to be present. The composition does not have an oily or resinous texture at all, unlike most of the oudh perfumes I've tried.  KYOTO seems to me sometimes like incense ashes liquified but also, in turns, crushed sticks of unburned incense. That's about it for the development trajectory, though, as this is a fairly simple affair. I do not detect any floral notes at all, just incense in one form or another‚Äîthere can be no denying that, as advertised, incense is the focus of this creation!  Despite the lack of a significant oily base, KYOTO has good staying power and fairly big sillage.

I can\'t compare it to others because I dislike them all and wear them so infrequently that I don\'t have enough memory to provide that kind of opinion. This one does feel softer than the others, though. UPDATE: Far into the drydown, it seems to become more complex, and interesting, but there is that ""metallic dust"" quality that some may not like. UPDATE #2: This began to smell similar to something else, and after a few minutes I realized what it is: Listen for Men by Herb Alpert. They are not identical; Kyoto is woodier no doubt, but if you are looking for the far drydown of Kyoto you should try Listen. The first few hours, though, aren\'t that similar.', 'This one starts out with a blast of incense followed by a cypress note giving a woodsy aspect to this fragrance. In the drydown the burned wood aroma still present and so, the fragrance stays until the end.

It doesn't even conjure up the imagery of far east particularly. Obviously that is because there are so many ingredients which are not instinctively/directly link to Japan. Especially it has an oily, a bit sticky, plastic feel of woody undertone that smells rather peculiar to me. It doesn't bother me but it just cannot create any image or emotion that I desire from a fragrance to touch me. However, my younger sister who is a very incensy girl seems to like it a lot. But she loves Avignon much better which is completely her Holy Grail. As my favorite from the line is Jaisalmer. Both of them are so true to what they are intended to depict. If you are looking for a scent which depicts Kyoto both emotionally and intuitively better, I will definitely pick Kyoto by Santa Maria Novella as my personal recommendation. It is strong, cypressy, woody, and incensy, cold and aloof with delicate charm of earthy iris & ethereal lotus at the beginning but ends in deep, warm, meditative woody-incensy sumptuousness. I can smell the air and mountain of Kyoto from the bottle literally. Definitely worth of a try."", 'CdG Incense Kyoto has a very calming, soothing and relaxing effect for me. I smell mainly the aroma of cypress oil, the green of vetiver and the wood of cedar. I found similar cypress and vetiver notes in Encre Noire Lalique which is darker and stronger.

I do get a dry sandalwood, but it seems covered over by a soapy floral which I find a bit ""lady\'s boudoir""-ish. By using immortelle (not native to Japan, as far as I know), they may be trying to replicate the kind of smoky scent of Japanese camelia (""tsutsuji""). Anyway, not for me, this one, but a lady of my acquaintance likes it quite well. It\'s more of a fragrance than an incense, if I can make that distinction.', ""A minimalistic masterpiece. Kyoto brings to my mind of the unscented incense sticks used by the Nichiren Shoshu Buddhists (the Japanese most practiced Buddhism branch).

At no point do I smell any coffee at all. I don‚Äôt smell much incense, either, or anything remotely resembling any of the Japanese incense that I have. As the mace goes away, the cedar and cypress leaves and woods appear.  I would like to be able to say that the overall impression is like walking down a sun-warmed forest path, and maybe it would be, but I just can‚Äôt get past the spicy smell, so the overall effect is more like a kitchen spice-drawer than anything out in nature. The actual scent is so incongruent with the listed notes and description that I have to wonder if my sample was mislabeled.  For the first hour there‚Äôs some sillage, but after that there‚Äôs only a subtle skin scent that remains linear. After 3-4 hours it‚Äôs mostly gone. It is, after all, an EdT, so lack of longevity is not too surprising.

I can smell no coffe, which again is a pity, `cause I love coffe scent in frags. The patchouli blended with the woods is very... hmmm... elegant, very appealing. Patchouli can be earthy and I like it then, but not here. There`s a sweet note, which I can`t track. All in all, it`s a very interesting scent. On the one hand, very masculine, on the other one, very sensual in its own way. Yet, my husband doesn`t share my admiration.

To compare with C.Lacroix's Tumulte, Kyoto's smoother, lighter, deeper, less masculin, while Tumulte is dry, stronger and edger. However, they are really similar to eachother. Onething that I complain about Kyoto: its longervity is not so good.  Anyway, Kyoto is really a signature incense scent. 8,5/10"", ""I have been wanting to try Kyoto for a long time and was not disappointed when I finaly did. This is a pretty, elegant, very wearable incense and cedar fragrance with a delicate hint of fruitiness. It's soft, round and ethereal.  It is of course tempting to make a comparison with another incense and cedar fragrance: Christian Lacroix's Tumulte. They are undoubtedly in the same family, but there are important differences. Tumulte, for instance, is much, much dryer and has a definite harshness in the top notes. Kyoto on the other hand opens very smoothly and even with a hint of sweetness. There is also a difference on the skin: Kyoto seems to be warming it, while Tumulte does not. On the whole I would say that Tumulte is more rugged and masculine, Kyoto more elegant and peaceful.

He was visiting from Spain, was arty, and smelled so good. I asked what it was, and he told me it was Comme des Garcons Incense Kyoto. I took him home with me, had a great time, and his scent was left behind. I was so hooked I needed to buy some of it for myself. It became a no. 1 go-to scent for several months thereafter. I loved how it smelled so calm and clean, meditative and grounding. This was such a contrast to the turbulent life that I led at the time, with so much escapism, sleeping around, and untended wounds. I long since ran out and never replenished Kyoto; I am almost afraid it will transport me to that time, and I am not so sure I am ready for that. But I do look back fondly, and can still smell it in my mind.', 'To me, being a Japanese, this fragrance wouldn\'t remind me of Kyoto at all - it is more like ""Kyoto that Westerner would think of"". Please don\'t misunderstand - the smell itself is really gorgeous, but only a bit too floral. I think this is the reason why I don\'t associate the name of Kyoto with this fragrance..... If you would like to reminisce about your trip to Kyoto (or Japan), why not try CdG\'s ""Wonderwood"" or Diptyque\'s ""Tam Dao""?

For a while, I picture the ancient heavy wooden doors of a buddhist temple high in the mountains, but even that starts to decay into disrepair. After that, it becomes medicinal, like the wood is rotting into dirt rather than being smoky, and I think it's weaker than the others.

It's not all that bad, but it's just so uninteresting after smelling CdG do the smoke/wood genre a hundred different ways, because I know how good they are at differentiating one from another. It is more organic than the others because of the living dirt/compost aspect, and it does this much less synthetically than other wet, decaying forest floor scents I know (He Wood and its flankers!).

It‚Äôs sweet but not overly so, with a toasted sugar warmth that evokes comfort.  What I love with this brand is the fact the fragrance does not evolve over time. What you get in the first spray remains consistent throughout the day. This could be seen as a limitation to some, but in my opinion and for my own taste, it‚Äôs a strength: a steady, indulgent presence that never wavers, never changes. Also, longevity on skin or fabric is great.

I\'m intrigued by the percentage of essential oils infused into each Profumum Roma EdP. And yes, the cost of these fragrances supports the exceptional quality of the products. So, I was REALLY looking forward to trying four, generous decant samples of Profumum Roma fragrances, Acqua e Zucchero was one of the fragrances among the four samples I purchased.

My generous samples were NOT inexpensive. And truthfully, I didn\'t really find a great ""match"" for the fragrance I am seeking with this house... And NOW, I must admit...after initially feeling beyond neutral about this fragrance, Acqua e Zucchero has GROWN on me! It really has! And I love it! Acqua e Zucchero wears a LOT like many of the similar fragrances on the niche market these days (and even some mainstream fragrances) that are fruity, raspberry, cotton candy, vanilla and tooth-achingly sweet. AeZ DOES wear a bit like the $18.99 Aquolina Pink Sugar, or Prada Candy, I suppose. But the highest quality of ingredients in Acqua e Zucchero and the way these ingredients perform together really make AeZ stand alone in its own lane. The opening is definitely super-sugary, pink, cotton-candy, bubble-gummy sweet. As it develops, the dry down is smoother, more subtle with remnants of deep, creamy, vanilla and something a bit sour (resinous), which is reminiscent of orange blossom flower (the stems and leaves more than the petals themselves). Then the dry down presents lots of mixed fruit (I detect raspberries, perhaps pears) and lots of sugary, sweet vanilla. I\'ll keep wearing it and see how I feel about the fragrance over time. EDITED TO ADD: After applying this several nights at bedtime and being lulled to sleep by the wonderful fragrance (as I snuggle into my arm), I am PLEASANTLY surprised to wake some 8+ hours later and still easily detect this fragrance on my skin.

I still absolutely adore this fragrance, what I get off this fragrance is just essentially a very well blended mix of like powdered sugar and vanilla. I personally do not get any notes of fruit other than at the start quickly wearing off. If you are looking for something fruity I wouldn‚Äôt buy this. I feel this fragrance could also be used to layer/compliment other colognes as it is just so linear but not in a bad way. It is also oil based so it comes with a decant and roller. 9.9/10 (it is a lil overpriced)', ""For those who are saying this smells like pink sugar by Aquolina, I agree, there are similarities in the scent profile... but just like the other hundreds of perfumes that have a similar scent profile... they are NOT the same.

The quality is unmatched (as with all Profumum Roma perfumes - which i own most of them) Pink Sugar was Launched in 2004, 2 whole years after AZ, so if there is one copying the other, it doesn't take a genius to figure out who.

Just by chance, I got my nose on it in a local, small-business-owned fragrance boutique. I had taken a friend there for her birthday with the goal of finding her a gift, and the owner was bringing us a wide range of options to test. At the end of the afternoon, my friend took home a wonderful Scents of Wood and I took home Acqua e Zucchero! I otherwise never, ever would have tried it (particularly since I just haven\'t clicked with any Profumum Roma before). I remember hearing in the mid-2000s that Pink Sugar was extremely popular, but I had never tried it and wouldn\'t have been able to pick it out or identify that scent profile. I think I\'m just late to the party on this one! Though AeZ seems suitable for year-round wear, I myself expect to wear this playful, flirty fragrance mostly during the spring and summer. The high quality of the ingredients coupled with performance longevity elevate the composition and keep it sophisticated, as ""girly"" as this scent can feel. Its simplicity is its charm. EDIT (7/5/2023): I can\'t stop wearing this. Already I\'ve made a huge dent in the bottle. And I\'ve purchased the corresponding body oil and body lotion....What is happening?? I still can\'t believe I like this so much. It\'s divine for layering. EDIT (1/20/2025): I still love this, although I think the better part of the tart red berries note has started to fade from my bottle. A characteristic of Profumum Roma, I think, is its powerful linearity. I mostly use this fragrance for layering these days, although I do wear it on its own for running errands and lowkey weekend activities. I really enjoy having a high-quality ingredient, high oil-concentration fragrance that is just an easy fun wear -- not something so precious.', ""I've never heard of Pink Sugar, regardless completely gut wrenching experience, sweet, fruity, powdery, intense, linear, quite oily smelling, absolutely not for me."", 'A more expensive, adult-y version of Pink Sugar. Not worth buying since I already have almost an identical dupe.', 'I‚Äôm on the fence about this one. I love vanillas, but something about this one doesn‚Äôt smell smooth on my skin.

I am someone who thinks licorice is a scourge on this planet so naturally I feel the same way about this scent.', ""The berries and vanilla clash with each other and it brings out a harsh sweetness I don't like. The vanilla also gives it a bit of a sunscreen quality. I think it has the potential to smell better on skin, but on paper it's a no for me."", 'It smells like Showtime Kylie Minogue! They are exactly the same. Identical!', ""This is Pink Sugar minus the licorice. They're nearly identical. I thought they wouldn't be as similar as people claimed since the notes are fairly different, but I almost can't separate them."", 'I just bought Pink Sugar bc of the comparisons to it here. Is it kind of similar? Yes. Are they spot on? Absolutely not. Pink Sugar at fist spray is very similar, but a couple seconds later the licorice comes in and ruins it. Even after the licorice calms down they still aren‚Äôt the same. There is also a HUGE difference in performance. This lasts all day with just a few sprays and lingers in a room for a long time. Pink Sugar is all but gone after 15 minutes, even with 12 or more sprays, on clothes and skin. I‚Äôll stick with this one, by comparison Pink Sugar is a waste of money. The 30ml of Pink Sugar I just got will be empty in about 5-7 more applications. I‚Äôve been using a 18ml travel spray of this one for months now and have about 6-8mls left. It‚Äôs more initially, but worth it imo.', ""I don't smell Pink Sugar at all, I get slighly powedery sweetness and then a sourness.

Not super complex, but a beautiful scent if you like sweet gourmand fragrances. The staying power and sillage are nuclear, and there's something citrusy buried under all that sugar, making it perfect for balmy summer nights as long as you don't over-spray it.

I'm not good with white florals. Of course my first thoughts were of the (in)famous pink one, and I was skeptical about a perfume similar to such a reliable cheapie, but the warm base gives it deep dimension and it grows more lovely as it dries down to a skin scent.

It is also a little powdery, like a dusted sugar kind of smell, which keeps this scent from being too juvenile. Great performance on skin too!', 'Love this scent! Big sillage and really long lasting. Sweet but would not agree with others that it is overly sweet. If you think this is too expensive, please try Pink sugar by Aquolina which is 90 % similar (but AZ is a bit more fresh).', ""Smells like a dryer sheet at first.

I can see a lot of people liking this one because of how casual it is."", ""The other day I was looking for an elegant scent with strawberries, which is very unlike me. The strawberries I mean. Because to me, this reads as girly, cheap, and deodorant-like.  They didn't have a real strawberry fragrance but what I encountered instead is this scent. I was immediately in love. They didn't have it in stock and today it finally arrived :D For me, it evokes pure joy and excitement. As if I'm sitting on a chain carousel and while flying through the air different notes hit my nose and become a delicious yummy pink-golden blur. First I'm hit with orange blossoms and a very deep sugary note: tonka bean/caramel? It's as if someone forgot their sugar in a pan and it's already starting to develop a bit of fume. Then there's a whiff of strawberry syrup. The other day, we had champagne and sugared strawberries for brunch. Cause I was still craving that strawberry note. I ladled the remaining juice into the Champagne glasses when the strawberries were gone. That's the note I'm getting sauf the Champagne. So far the fragrance could be quite sticky and sugary. But there is a high note, that floats atop the base like an overtone. It's not there to be acknowledged but to brighten everything. This fresh sour accord is owed to lemon blossom and possibly also lemon zest. The vanilla that's wafting over has a hint of creaminess to it. And then the forest berries become more pronounced. Like candied fruit. But also very authentically smelling of forest berries and a bit of woodiness. I'm getting wild strawberries and brambleberry; also the leaves of brambleberries, maybe even a hint of sandalwood.  As the swirling of notes quietens down a bit, there's a lovely scent of rose. But there's no pinkiness to it more of an apricot. It reminds me of those David Austin roses. And it's already withered and slightly decayed with notes of hay and peach. You know when you stretch out your hand to touch it or bring it closer to your nose, and the petals just fall into your hand soft like the finest suede and you are left with the inflorescence.  At the end of my ride, I'm getting a breeze of Cointreau and a bit of almond liqueur. Maybe this mixed with the caramel smoke is what hits people's noses as plasticky? Not to me though. There's nothing sharp. It's all so beautifully blended with the lemony glint to lend it freshness. Throughout this merry-go-round spinning, the orange blossom never loses its radiance. What started as a dark red and amber-coloured elixir ends in a warm, pink and golden swirl with the softest cloudlets of magenta. I want my life to be like this perfume smells: Joyful, exciting, comforting, sweet with a bit of darkness - a wistfulness. And filled with golden sunshine."", ""I had to see if it was true, and yes to me also it is very similar to Pink sugar. Sure it is more refined, less sweet, a bit more grounded (myrrh?). It's like the bougier twin sister."", 'I love this scent. For those that don‚Äôt know, it was released before Pink Sugar, making PS the dupe. I think this smells better and more uplifting than PS, being honest. The bottom line is, this fragrance makes me happy‚Ä¶ I wear it when I‚Äôm at home or when I‚Äôve had a bad day or if I have anxiety. The performance is great and it comforts me and soothes me when I smell it. I don‚Äôt care how much it costs.

Wonderfull! Smells very familiar, to the point that I realize not only do I know this scent, but I have it on the shelf too! Undeniably, Aquolina did it first with Pink Sugar! I smile, recognizing old flame and than I gigle, remembering the price and comparing the difference! To me the scents are identical and being honest with myself, I do not need Acqua Zuccero as it does not add anything new to this story. Given another example: All about Eve, by Joop - old and budget friendly, and La Danza del Libelullle by Nobile 1942 - new and more expensive, - I prefer to keep La Danza not only because it is very well done, better than the ""original"", but also because of the new interpretation of the composition, added ""omph and yam"". In case of Acqua Zuccero, I say:""Nice try"",- and keep walking :)', 'Basically, this is a powdery vanilla with tons of citrus in the top. No forest fruits detected. Pretty after the citrus burns off. Close to the skin and soft. Not what I expected for this price point. Smells cheaper at first. Dries down to a warm, cozy amber/labdanum mix that is pretty to run your nose through. On the sweet side but not gourmand.', ""I'm very conflicted about this fragrance.  I have been on the hunt for a new, sweet, gourmand fragrance that lasts and projects very well. I was so excited to get this in the mail -- along with Vanitas and Battito d'Ali -- and the testers for all of the scents came in today. I was underwhelmed by all of them (especially Vanitas, but that's another review) except for Acqua e Zucchero. This is a beautiful scent, no way around it. The opening is very strong on the orange blossom, with traces of Vanilla frolicking in the background. It's a very fresh sweet scent. I know that sounds like a bit of conundrum, but it is. The forest fruits come into play as the scent starts heading into the heart, and then finally it dries down into a very sweet fruity vanilla. It is definitely a very strong scent, as my sister told me she could smell me from down the hallway. However, my issue with the scent is not the smell itself, or lasting power, or sillage -- which would be the case with most other fragrances --- my issue with it is the cost for the price. I don't care what anyone says, this DOES smell like Pink Sugar. My younger sister owns a bottle, and when I asked her to smell each of the Profumum Roma fragrances, the first thing she said was that it smells like Pink Sugar. I have to agree with her. While this scent is definitely more of a quality blend, and not synthetic smelling in the slightest, the only difference I smell between this and Pink Sugar is that Acqua e Zucchero is fresh. There's a coldness in this scent that is not in Pink Sugars warmness. Acqua e Zucchero is a bit more creamy as well. It's funny too, but Vanitas ALSO smells like Pink Sugar if not more so. Actually, Vanitas smells worse imo. Vanitas covers the warmness that Acqua e Zucchero lacks. For this scent I prefer the opening and heart much more than I enjoy the dry down. The difference, to me, is not enough to justify purchasing this for almost 300 dollars.  Apart of me does still want to buy this fragrance because I do like the subtle difference it has from Pink Sugar, but honestly, I think the magic of this scent would be dwindled for me a bit because I don't think anyone aside from yourself and avid perfume lovers will be able to tell a very noticeable difference between the two scents. And I would honestly be annoyed if I spent $275 on a fragrance just to smell exactly like someone who saved $260 with Pink Sugar. If you do buy this over Pink Sugar, you will get a lot of wear out of this and the bottle will last you a long time. You can also wear this in warmer weather a lot more easily than Pink Sugar. If that justifies the difference to you, go out there and get it. But anyone trying to convince you that this scent has its own great space outside of Pink Sugar, might be a tiny bit in denial. Quality of ingredients can be higher, but that doesn't mean the scent composition is actually a justified $260 difference. Also this does not smell like marshmallows to me, which is what I was hoping for. It smells like candied fruits -- think Tanghulu."", ""Yes, it's sweet...but also surprisingly complex. And clearly made with quality ingredients. There is no way a $30 perfume could ever smell as good as this. Imagine a sweet vanilla and orange blossom-scented meringue. Would I want to smell like this every day? Probably not, but I'm glad I bought a bottle for those days where I want to feel comforted.

To me, unimpressive. 5.5/10 EDIT: Upon revisiting this, I can now appreciate the smoothness in the blend, the berries with powdered sugar, creamy to an extent, in the cooler winds this gives off a happy sweet joyful vibe, as it dries the plastic essence becomes more and more potent, anyways, I came to liking it more, and the performance is outright beastly. Revised personal rating: 7/10', ""Got a sample blind, and really liked it! Nice staying power, very sweet but also warm. Very cotton candy.

So, this fragrance is sweet and fruity, it smells really good and i can see the similarity to Symphonium but it doesn't have that beautiful cacao note or the woody base. It leans a bit feminine in my opinion and the performance is great. If you like your fragrances simple but beautiful, this might be a choice for you."", ""I absolutely agree with the Pink Sugar comparison, which I cannot stand because it smells like a mixture of cotton candy and laundry detergent. And not in a good way. Although I don't think AeZ is AS bad as PS (I didn't need to immediately scrub it off for fear of being sick), it's still too similar for me. And way more expensive. The good thing about it (if you enjoy this scent, that is) is that it's very strong and long lasting. EDIT: Never mind, it's as bad as PS. As soon as I posted this review I had to scrub it. AND THE SCENT IS STILL THERE.. It just kept getting stronger and stronger, just like Pink Sugar did for me, and I couldn't take it anymore. I've had to put on long sleeves just to get away from the scent. There's also a Victoria's Secret body mist that smells just like this.

Where Aqua e Zucchero is softer, and dries to a mix of sweet berries, vanilla and milk on my skin. It‚Äôs beautiful! Very long lasting.  The only gripe I have is the sprayer. It‚Äôs very cheap feeling. And for the price, everything about the fragrance should be more sturdy and luxe. Otherwise, it‚Äôs an absolutely lovely, sweet fragrance.', ""This hasn't been reformulated.

I have a recent batch and the longevity is outstanding."", ""I got Pink Sugar instead years ago when I used to get infuriated by overpriced perfume. But there is clearly a pact in the aromachemical companies to make the more expensive perfumes smell better because we all know that the perfume in a bottle is but a couple of dollars worth of blended aromachemical oils. Sugar is ethyl maltol. Vanilla is vanillin chemicals apparently there are several. There is no fruit extract and rarely any real ultra expensive flower extracts like rose and jasmine. I buy these oils and often smear them on before spraying perfumes that feature the notes. But I love abstract perfumes all the more because they aren't trying to copy 'nature'. This sugar water is a perfect sweet perfume. It's not overly vanilla or fruit. If there are any flower notes like orange blossom they don't tip over as in the gorgeous Kllian Love. Now hopelessly deep into these intoxicating sugar vanilla perfumes I just have to have them all. This one is a perfect sugar, and I have a brand new bottle just arrived today from Europe. It's deeply roundly sweet, not over vanillic, floral, perfumey, or berry, super long lasting, with fabulous sillage. if you want a sugar water, this is perfection."", ""When I first encountered the name of this fragrance I thought about the singer Zucchero, I used to love listening all his music and songs....I somehow has forgotten about it, I must put on some music today, so thank you Acqua Zucchero for reminding me about that music:-) Now, off to the fragrance: On my skin immediately after application it starts briefly with the smoke of caramelised sugar, the one I prepare for a much loved creme caramel, but that's really for a few first seconds, then all the forest fruits very clearly appeared and stay for awile, these fruits are so real, like I am in a forest collecting wild fruits and am surrounded by tall pine trees which aroma mixes altogether with the fruits, this is so real smell, just amazing, there is a very distant pine resin smell attached to the scent as well, it is very faint, however there.

This is *much less sweet* and not overpowering however it does smell yummy, and sometimes fruit sweet like an orange creamsicle, and sometimes cotton candy sweet with a caramel edge to it.

I wanted a nice summer scent that had some ""body"" to it. Not just a citrus-freshy. My problem with fragrances that have vanilla in it is often that they\'re too sweet for my taste. And thus also not very suitable for hotter weather. This one does not have that problem. The vanilla is there (and I love that smell!), but it\'s balanced out by the other notes. This makes it so that yes, you smell vanilla. And yes, it\'s sweet. But not too sweet. The intense edge vanilla can have is beautifully smoothed out by the other notes. The whole composition is quite delightful. Perfectly unisex (me: male, 37), but I can imagine that some men would find it a little too feminine. Vanilla will do that. Don\'t be fooled by the small number of notes. There are terrible fragrances created from countless notes and there are wonderful ones created from few. This fragrance is the latter. Performance is excellent. It stays and stays and keep projecting decently, but it\'s not overly present. Of course that\'s also a matter of how much you apply. I read that someone said that a little bit goes a long way and I find that somewhat true. Absolutely, a little bit will keep performing, but when it comes to projection, a little bit more may be necessary. The objective quality of the ingredients is more than adequate. The quality matches the price and thus you get something that smells natural and real. You will not find this synthetic. Generally the price seems a bit high, but I find it appropriate. You do get quality. I don\'t know if fragrances from this house are meant to be layered, but I think they are very well suited for that. I tested a couple and have looked up the note breakdowns of a few more and give the minimalistic approach, they are probably excellent for creating a signature scent by layering a few. With quality that is far above something like Jo Malone. But on its own, it works great as well. A wearable vanilla for warmer days. Worth sampling!', ""I have to agree with other reviewers, this one does remind me of both Soft by Al Rehab and Pink Sugar by Aquolina. That's not a bad thing, as they are all enjoyably sweet and lighthearted fragrances. This one is really smooth and is not headachey, but honestly for the price I can't see indulging in a full bottle unless there is really some note or accord in the Al Rehab or the Aquolina that you can't stand.

Plus, I do respect that mean snap of pink sugar. So the crazy thing about Zucchero is (I could be wrong) but from what I can see from perfumes that are like pink sugar is that Zucchero may have been the original. Pink sugar came out 2 years later. Could you imagine all the popularity Zucchero could have had if Profumum perfumes were more affordable and better known? Of course no one heard of aquolina till pink sugar came around in the states. It\'s kind of mind blowing.  So now Zucchero is a ""dupe"" of pink sugar, even though it\'s probably the original. So we should really all be calling pink sugar a Zucchero dupe. It\'s crazy. Now the only people who buy Zucchero are probably elitists or dislike the mean snap in pink sugar enough to drop 10x the price on a bottle of the original Zucchero.', ""Another fragrance much like Aquolina's Pink Sugar and Al Re-hab's Soft, only slightly more fruitier than powdery, imo.

I definitely get the gourmand but not so much the orange blossom. I have gotten many compliments and definitely the ""it smells like cotton candy"" (in a good way) comments.

I give this one an A+, one of the first ones from this outstanding house and one of the best!', ""Acqua e Zucchero is an unusual composition, but that's becoming normal for Profumum, that seems to artistically and boldly go where many fragrance houses seem not to, and AEZ is no exception, pushing the boundaries on what I expect fragrance to be, and what I expect to like. As usual, Profumum's note breakdown is pretty limited, at least in terms of what they disclose, so it's simply listed as vanilla, orange blossom, and some mix of fruit (berries, red fruit, forest fruit, something to that effect). It's sweet and vanilla-laden but light and fresh enough to be worn in warm weather. Not light as in weak on performance, to be clear, as it's still up to Profumum's standard performance that is very strong, the extreme of most houses. I'm not familiar with the Pink Sugar fragrance to which many seem to liken AEZ, but I'll offer that it doesn't smell of cotton candy to me, though some seem to think that's case. It's far more natural-smelling to me than cotton candy specifically or confections in general. Overall, it's a very pleasant scent that's unusually productive, not in my typical wheelhouse, but it's strong in several categories---performance (as expected), versatility, creativity, and fun. 8 out of 10"", 'I totally agree with RobBob.

PR is beginning to make me forget other fragrances that I love. Because I am, willingly, happily addicted to their perfumes. I don\'t take addiction lightly either! Acqua E Zucchero is a beautiful perfume that almost defies description. In their usual, abbreviated, short-hand notation, there are only three notes 1) Vanilla, 2) Berries and 3) Orange Blossom. I definitely smell the vanilla and the berries, the orange blossom, not so much (but I don\'t doubt it\'s existence). This has been called a very ""sweet"" fragrance. It is also said that it is a ""girl\'s fragrance"". One reviewer, a woman, even said that she\'s too ""old"" to wear this fragrance. I have to disagree with some of that. I\'m a man and my nose does not discern between male or female scents. My nose only directs scent to my brain. Then my nose and my brain tell me if I like a scent or not. Acqua E Zucchero goes to that pleasure spot in my brain that is right next to liking amazing food and good sex. When I wear AEZ my nose and brain are happy. I wear this to bed, because it then becomes part of my sleep. I dislike when people attach their interpretations of who should wear this type of fragrance. Until I bought a bottle of Acqua E Zucchero, I may have shied away from what I was told was a ""girls"" fragrance - not any more. Acqua E Zucchero has opened a whole new gourmand group of fragrances to me, that I now love. I\'m going to buy Dulcis In Fundo and Vanitas as well. As I said earlier, I\'m addicted. I can say with certainty that, in the near future, I am going to have at least nine bottles of PR\'s perfumes. I will indeed be a happy man with all my PR perfumes... Gentlemen, do not be shy to try this perfume. Let your nose tell you whether or not you like it. Reading the reviews I didn\'t think I would like this at all. I was wrong, I love it. Grazie Profumum Roma!', ""Acqua E zuchero is not a complicated fragrance, but what it does it does it to perfection. It opens fruity bit in a candy way, somewhat cotton candy vibe, like mixing the pink and purple and red ones together and you would get a similar vice to the opening. the opening also has a very nice orange blossom flower vibe in it that doesn't allow it to become overly sweet, it also gives it a fresh vibe, but not aquatic fresh, although acqua means water, there's nothing clear or cause about this fragrance. there's not much change , but to candidness does town down a bit and the vanilla starts to shine while the candy vibe sits more in the back. As you get more into the dry down the vanilla gets more creamy and almost caramel like. If you have ever smelled xerjoff lira, then it reminds me a bit of that caramel/vanilla combo that lira provides. Performance is great with this it will definitely not let you down in that department.

Pinksugar higher echelon version or something. But it wasn't - it was simply 1million. Then almost immediately, it's joined by a really well-done Skittles vibe.  This I liked, along with the sweetness that seems like a true watery-syrup but the orange-designer vibe never goes away and ruins the whole intention of getting out the clear, focused fruity sweetness.

Sadly, all I'm getting is sweet berries and some vanilla - too fruity for my liking and - may I say - too simple for this price."", ""Based on the reviews, I was expecting this to be a softer, more mature version of Pink Sugar (which I love smelling on other people, but on me the licorice note is sharp and too pronounced). As a lover of orange blossom, I was also hoping I would detect more of that note. Unfortunately, on my skin, Acqua e Zucchero smells EXACTLY like Pink Sugar and Delicious Cotton Candy...*sharp* from what I presume could be an unlisted licorice or anise note, and a bit *dusty* from the type of vanilla that was used. It doesn't soften, and no woody notes emerge on my skin like they do for other people wearing Acqua e Zucchero. My personal opinion, based on my own skin chemistry, is that this is way too expensive for what it is, considering Pink Sugar is so widely available and much more affordable. Pink Sugar has much better sillage, too. It was worth a test, though."", ""This is the fancy girl's Pink Sugar, definitely. It's the same general fruity, sugary sweet with vanilla scent, like cotton candy but warm with hints of tart berry. It's less cloying and more grown up than Punk Sugar, has a more complicated and wonderful dry-down, and lasts forever. I got compliment after compliment while wearing this, from women and men alike. Everyone seemed to love it - friends kept coming to smell me and my man kept telling me how wonderful I smelled. While yes, it's definitely an outrageous price for something that does smell an awful lot like the much cheaper Pink Sugar, if longevity and a quite a bit more class mean a lot to you, I say go for it. Or at least check out The Perfumed Court or Surrender to Chance to see if you can get a decant of it. It's a beautiful, sexy, comforting, sweet and warm scent, and well worth every penny."", 'Very berry and very sweet. It smells like a candy, a chocolate berry but artificial. Then it becomes strange, kind of medicinal smell. The opening is playful, like a teens fragrance but then it all turns cloying, overly sweet and annoying.', 'I tried to like this, but the fruity notes make it overly sweet for me. They overpower the vanilla which is the note I most enjoy.', 'Acqua e Zucchero is a potent gourmand. Oddly, the top notes seem to dominate: it has a fizzy, sharp, almost stinging effect on the nose. This undoubtedly comes from a burnt sugar note as well as some zesty citrus. It reminds me of sipping bubbly champagne while eating a piece of rich, caramel cake. To me, any hint of orange blossom is clouded by the effect of this sharp sweetness.  Others have compared this to Pink Sugar, and I have to agree. But, to be honest, I prefer Pink Sugar (perhaps this is a bit controversial). The top notes in Zucchero are a bit too shrieky and long lasting for my taste, whereas I feel that PS has richer, warmer base notes and a more sultry dry down.  If you are a gourmand lover, this is worth a sample, even if just to compare and contrast with your other foodie favorites. For me, It\'s yummy enough to be a ""like"" but not distinctive enough to be a ""love.""', 'Great perfume, if you love Paco 1 Mil or H&M, you will love this. This perfume starts as a citrus laced cotton candy. Then drys down very manly with woods and suttle spice. Love it! 10/10', ""Yep, I get Pink Sugar also. The drydown is a little less sugary, something a bit more woodsy in it and maybe a touch of cinnamon? But I can't get past that PS phase."", ""I decided to find and sample Pink Sugar to compare. Yes, the concept might be similar in prominent notes(vanilla, sugar, fruits), but the rendition is far different: A&Z smells natural and has greater depth and complexity- especially in the vanilla note where PS smells very linear. The raspberry note in PS to me smells synthetic- like a red #40-infused slush. A&Z also has an entirely-different base/drydown than PS. And then there is the difference in concentration... I would be able to tell immediately which was which! PS- though it is pleasant and has many fans which I don't mean to disrespect- does NOT compare."", ""l just tried it in a perfume shop today and got a sample. l was very intrigued by the smell. lt is very interesting, smells of red oranges and sweet. l kept on smelling the sample on my skin all evening and then suddenly it reminded me of Mugler's Angel which l used some years ago. The first impression is different but the base notes on my skin smell identical."", 'Similar (in a creepy way) to pink sugar (which I like, just, have been around town too much). Prettier though, soft woodsy sweet, cute in a childish way, happy and joyful in a mature way. Just a bit too pricy? Scenery: Cheesy beach kisses, long dresses, summer vacation, late mornings, marketplaces, a vespa.', ""Wow! I think this has to be the best-done fragrance of this type! The orange blossom is just there on the edge to add an ethereal sophistication, and does anyone else smell just a hint of linden-blossom? Caramelized sugar, vanilla, and a touch of fruit (there's more than just raspberries)- all balanced equisitely. For me, this screams summer and fairs- what could be better? Update: can't get this one out of my head! I know most of this frag's fans are women (I'm a guy), but I'm beginning not to care..."", 'A more expensive Pink Sugar. Very very very adorable. Pink Sugar is one of my everlasting favourites, I have it always in my perfume collection even thoug I don¬¥t use it a lot.  Acqua e Zucchero is the perfect scent for all sugar and cotton candy lovers and lasts for hours. But if you don¬¥t want to spend 150 Euros for 100ml you should choose Pink Sugar. 120 Euro cheaper than this and 99% the same maybe not that elegant and hasn¬¥t this genuine image. But: who cares? ;-)', ""Just tried my sample. I kept thinking, I have smelled this before, hum.....where....so familiar....then it hit me. My daughter is freakishly addicted to Pink Sugar. I will agree with others though, this is a more grown up fragrance, not the teenager locker room gym class spray after working out. I think I will have to get a FB of this. Yep I'm loving it. I used to love Pink Sugar until she took it over, and while it does smell good on her, this one is for mom :) I love this line."", ""I adore this wow as soon as I sprayed this I was in love. Really well done, soft, warm cosy vanilla with a delicate sweet hint of wild berry fruits. The sillage and longevity are great many gourmand scents don‚Äôt have much of either but this one is well worth a fb. It is expensive but you do get a huge bottle and the perfume is divine. If you like the sweeter end of the perfume spectrum, go for it. There is nothing not to like. I can make out the three main notes and feel they are nicely balanced. All in all it's a lovely sweet perfume to wear I'd give it 9 out of 10."", 'AeZ really does smell like burnt sugar, along with a fresh, sugar-cane like note. After a while there appears a fairly strong fruity-floral note along with the burnt sugar. There‚Äôs a good bit of sillage, and it lasts for 8-12 hours on skin, and is still present after a shower. Once the fruity-floral ensemble joins the sugar, things stay linear through the drydown.  This is a pleasant gourmand scent that, despite its name, isn‚Äôt cloyingly sweet. I especially like the burnt sugar note. I‚Äôve tried several fragrances from Profumum and liked them all. This is not my favorite, but it‚Äôs still unique and worth a sniff if you like dessert-theme scents.', ""Over-th-top, maybe, but oh so very addictive! Lots of vanilla sweetness but also a top note of some tingling fresh stuff - and the top note lingers for a looooong time. Aqua e zucchero is really strong stuff one doesn't need much of it to be noticed. It IS very much similar to Pink Sugar, which is only a little bit 'softer' and OK maybe less elaborate on the tangerine top note. And on the wallet. Although Pink Sugar evaporates a bit faster."", 'COZY COZY COZY!!!! Move over Pink sugar, you are play-school compared to this beauty! So glad to have discovered this high-end Niche.  It opens with a cheerful orange blossom/spun sugar/vanilla, and it lifts your spirits immediately.  I am also pleasantly surprised at how ""natural"" it smells, my nose does not detect any nasty chemical/synthetics, (if there are any, which I doubt, then they are very well hidden!) The sillage is not too overpowering, especially given a few minutes to settle, by then, you are surrounded in a pillow of comforting vanilla marshmallow.....HEAVENLY!', 'This is a really sweet but great fragrance. It has a great staying power as well and is not making me nauseous or giving me a headache. I usually am not that much into very sweet fragrances but this is an exception! It is also really expensive though, so I am looking for something else that smells alike. Pink sugar I heard is much simpler, so if anyone has other suggestions? I love acqua di sale as well, which is very different, but also fantastic.', ""I love this perfume so much I'm positively giddy and giggly. While I smell the cotton candy reference, it's at most peripheral to the most perfect balance of orange blossom and vanilla that I've ever experienced. There's very definitely a carmelizing sugar smell but it's more like the way cotton candy smells when it's being spun. After about half an hour of development you detect a sharp acidity that must be the forest fruits (whatever they are). The sharpness is close to the skin but makes this an adult juice. Sweet for sure but sweet the way wonderful French champagne is. I LOVE THIS STUFF!"", ""Just came back from rome... And finally bought aqua e zucchero, with showergel and lotion. IT IS FANTASTIC!! I was affraid it would be to sweet, but is is not, and you smell the quality, and I do not understand that some revieuwers ( at others sites) that they compare it to aqualina.NO WAY!! It is delicious creamy, and for me so far the only vanilla that is not getting boring 'only vanilla' I also bought the new profumumscent, batito d'alba, gorgious, I keep it for summer.A more friendly, classy scent."", 'WOW! This is amazing! Totally ADDICTIVE! I love it so much, it is so comforting, sweet and luxurious. In my large collection of gourmand fragrances, this very well might be the most delicious and distinctive. Luckyscent has sent me a few samples of this over the years, and it took me a while to really ""get"" it. My initial dislike of Aqua e zucchero is that it smells quite like pink sugar, which I hate. It is different though, obviously of higher quality- soft and well blended cotton candy, vanilla and berries instead of pink sugars screamingly synthetic straight forward sticky sweet cotton candy. The vanilla in this smells almost identical to the one used in the same lines Vanitas- another fume I love (which is for some reason not on this site). Maybe PS just didnt work on my chemistry, but Aqua e zucchero smells great on me. SS chia also has a similar smell, but once again, it does not smell good on me, but better than PS. I would suggest this to people who like pink sugar but want something a little more adult and frankly, worlds prettier. You obviously do not have to like PS to enjoy this one, but if you arent up for a dead on berry cotton candy scent that lasts for many hours, pass on this one. My roommate said when he smells this he can practically see someone twirling the stick for the fresh, gourmet berry cotton candy- and hes right! He made a comment about ps being watered down, and smelling more like old, wrapped expired cotton candy and once again I agree with his nose, although I pick up a ton of anise as well in PS whereas its totally absent in this. I love to wear this perfume, it makes me happy every time I wear it and my roommate and other guys love it on me, it really brings joy to those around you if they like sweet scents. Sometimes I spray my sheets, clothes and GLOVES! I sprayed this on my cashmere gloves and even when I smoke a cig with them on, theres always that sweet goodness that is Aqua e Zucchero. The lasting power of this is amazing on cloth, and pretty good on skin, too. I have tried mixing it with other fumes as well with great results. I love it with tihota, jalaines vanilla and Vantitas, Blue Sugar, Miss dior cherie, Coco Mademoiselle but my favorite combination is Elixir Charnel Gourmand Coquin by Guerlain and this. Its like a gourmet candy store on my skin and I cant get enough of it! It is a great scent to layer! This is not for people who do not like sweet, foody or gourmand scents. It seems every site has the liquid in this different colors, but now that I have gotten mine I can tell you it is light yellow juice (similar color to vanitas, but less pigmented.) The bottle is expensive, but also very large at 100ml. I would suggest sampling pink sugar, ss chia and Aqua e Zucchero if you love cotton candy scents. Aqua e Zucchero is flat out delicious and it changed my mind forever on cotton candy fragrances- I used to hate them, but Aqua e Zucchero is so perfect with high quality vanilla and berries mixed with some sort of expensive candyfloss. BTW the body products by pink sugar like the whipped moisturizer smell more like this and less like my unflattering pink sugar description and layer well with this scent :) Men go bonkers for this scent more than anything else I have tried. I have 2 half empty bottles, one in my living room and one next to my bed and I know I will never be without this fragrance, I think if it isn\'t the best gourmand of all time, its way up the list! I have tried thousands, and this is top 5, sometimes even my number 1, depending on my mood. I had to make my roommate a decant for his sheets, it\'s his hands down favorite out of all of my 200ish perfumes- and I make him smell them all! So the verdict between the men and my life and myself is the same, this perfume is amazing- if not the best, one of the best. Good luck UPDATE: I just had to order 2 more bottles :) As I said, I cannot be without this fragrance and mine are getting pretty low. I want to give him the half full bottle because he loves it so much on his sheets and I noticed his decant was getting low. I want both him and I to enjoy my fragrances to the absolute full extent, and that includes sheets and occasional air freshener uses. If I couldn\'t afford to use it the way I do, I wouldn\'t, but I can, and with that in mind I want to enjoy this fragrance all the time... I have never used a bottle so quickly lol! I think this perfume will be a life long obsession for my roommate and I. I can\'t imagine growing tired of its comforting sweetness and luxurious aroma. Still not a fan of Pink Sugar, this is worlds better after extensive testing on both fragrances. This is the ultimate gourmand comfort scent that everyone who enjoys should be allowed to experience at least once (even though I did not like it for a long time and many tests). It grew on me so much it became a favorite. PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT DISCONTINUE THIS! I would have to get 10 bottles if I even heard rumor of discontinuation, after Tihota got discontinued I am totally freaked they will stop making all my favorites. :(', ""First impression: Way to sweet cream cake filling, sugared berries, strawberry oil? Almond essence (like the one you use in cooking) in the background. Cottoncandy, that's it! Overly sweet pink cottoncandy without the burnt notes.  An hour into the drydown it's very powdery.  I wasn't gonna give this scent one more chance but then I got the soft and powdery drydown..  After that, I keep coming back for more.."", 'This delightful fragrance has - in spite of its strong character - something innocently angelic in it. It is very potent, don\'t get me wrong! Powerful and lasting, strong and sweet, yet it\'s also dainty somehow and as ""ossini"" says - fragile.

Delicious and inviting, this is truly magical gem - sumptuous and chaste at the same time. :-)', ""this fragrance is without any comparison. The simple ingredients-- orange blossom, fruits and vanilla are a complex composition that evokes 'La dolce vita' on my skin.Acqua e zucchero is analagous to 'the HAUTE COUTURE of fruity florals'. Expensive but I wear this regularly; its been over 3 yrs and I still have about 15 ml left...stunningly sexy .UPDATE; JUST BOUGHT ANOTHER BOTTLE"", 'Aqua e Zucchero is not simply ‚ÄúSugar Water‚Äù, its a high premium perfume, a very soft sparkling fragrance, very fragile, not gluey or sleazy.  Although its not childish it reminds me of being a child on the safe hand of my grandfather who always spoiled me by buying me sweets and little toys at the kermis.... Its like a memory of the joy I had on the little carrousels or the happiness I felt riding on a clumsy little Haflinger Pony. It also brings pictures in my mind of my smiling grandmother, who watched me eating Cotton Candy and caramelized roast apples in my good Sunday dress with the patent leather shoes. I would like to describe Aqua e Zucchero with the colour ‚Äúrose‚Äù or ‚Äúsoft light pink‚Äù.  It can be compared to Aquolina ‚Äì Pink Sugar, but its more natural, gentle, delicate, mellow, and higher premium. The delicious sweet smell of Cotton Candy will charm you. A fragrance that will enrich your life and brings delight into the life of people that will be so lucky to smell Aqua e zucchero on you.', ""Fragrance -Acqua e Zucchero Profumum Roma Bottle from - 2015 Acqua e Zucchero reminds me of the old Grimm's fairy tale when Hansel and Gretel got lost in the deep forest and found a beautiful and colourful house built entirely from cakes and candies. It's a sweet,warm,delicious,comforting,gourmand and well-blended scent(especially vanilla and sugar with orange blossom,forest fruits and citrus notes).I would say a sweet,orange vanilla with a hint of citrus and fruit and enchanted with a forest magic,if that makes any sense.  Longevity - 10/10(12+hours) Silage/Projection - 9/10(several feet away for the first 3-4 hours) Weather - for more or less any time of year.I personally wouldn't wear this on a really hot summer days.

Emotions - delicious,sweet,warm,fairy tale,comforting, seductive,intoxicated. Occasion - best for nights out,date and romantic evening.  You'll get compliments and LOVE with this one."", ""So in theory, yes I like pink sugar but there's a burnt, cigarette, cheap accord that is off-putting to me.  *This* on the other hand made me üòç It's a fun, yummy composition.  I've tried other fragrances that remind me of pink sugar but none were good enough for me to want to own them. I'm convinced I need a bottle of Acqua e Zucchero but I will finish my sample first. You know, just to be sure. üòè Wish I would've found it sooner!"", 'I love this scent. For those that don‚Äôt know, it was released before Pink Sugar, making PS the dupe. I think this smells better and more uplifting than PS, being honest. The bottom line is, this fragrance makes me happy‚Ä¶ I wear it when I‚Äôm at home or when I‚Äôve had a bad day or if I have anxiety. The performance is great and it comforts me and soothes me when I smell it. I don‚Äôt care how much it costs. I would buy it again when my bottle runs out.', ""The other day I was looking for an elegant scent with strawberries, which is very unlike me. The strawberries I mean. Because to me, this reads as girly, cheap, and deodorant-like.  They didn't have a real strawberry fragrance but what I encountered instead is this scent. I was immediately in love. They didn't have it in stock and today it finally arrived :D For me, it evokes pure joy and excitement. As if I'm sitting on a chain carousel and while flying through the air different notes hit my nose and become a delicious yummy pink-golden blur. First I'm hit with orange blossoms and a very deep sugary note: tonka bean/caramel? It's as if someone forgot their sugar in a pan and it's already starting to develop a bit of fume. Then there's a whiff of strawberry syrup. The other day, we had champagne and sugared strawberries for brunch. Cause I was still craving that strawberry note. I ladled the remaining juice into the Champagne glasses when the strawberries were gone. That's the note I'm getting sauf the Champagne. So far the fragrance could be quite sticky and sugary. But there is a high note, that floats atop the base like an overtone. It's not there to be acknowledged but to brighten everything. This fresh sour accord is owed to lemon blossom and possibly also lemon zest. The vanilla that's wafting over has a hint of creaminess to it. And then the forest berries become more pronounced. Like candied fruit. But also very authentically smelling of forest berries and a bit of woodiness. I'm getting wild strawberries and brambleberry; also the leaves of brambleberries, maybe even a hint of sandalwood.  As the swirling of notes quietens down a bit, there's a lovely scent of rose. But there's no pinkiness to it more of an apricot. It reminds me of those David Austin roses. And it's already withered and slightly decayed with notes of hay and peach. You know when you stretch out your hand to touch it or bring it closer to your nose, and the petals just fall into your hand soft like the finest suede and you are left with the inflorescence.  At the end of my ride, I'm getting a breeze of Cointreau and a bit of almond liqueur. Maybe this mixed with the caramel smoke is what hits people's noses as plasticky? Not to me though. There's nothing sharp. It's all so beautifully blended with the lemony glint to lend it freshness. Throughout this merry-go-round spinning, the orange blossom never loses its radiance. What started as a dark red and amber-coloured elixir ends in a warm, pink and golden swirl with the softest cloudlets of magenta. I want my life to be like this perfume smells: Joyful, exciting, comforting, sweet with a bit of darkness - a wistfulness. And filled with golden sunshine."", ""Sweet, sugary, long-lasting and cheerful.  Not super complex, but a beautiful scent if you like sweet gourmand fragrances. The staying power and sillage are nuclear, and there's something citrusy buried under all that sugar, making it perfect for balmy summer nights as long as you don't over-spray it. Regarding the comparisons with pink sugar, I find them 50% similar, but A&Z is way better. And frankly, who cares? Buy fragrances that make you happy. Thumbs up from me!"", ""This is all the ingredients for an Italian cream cake stored safely in Tupperware bowls. Vanilla for days, orange flower water, ground nuts, sugar, but with a note of plastic underneath. It's such an odd fragrance--too pretty, like the buttercream frosting no one will swipe with a finger for a taste so as not to mar the icing; the child with the best manners and cleanest white dress that no-one will play with, for fear of getting her dirty. Undeniably sweet and somehow slightly sad."", ""I don't smell Pink Sugar at all, I get slighly powedery sweetness and then a sourness. Too close to the skin and there's a chemical smell that really kills it for me. (Someone else said i smelled nice however)"", ""Scent like colorful gummy candies for children. Let's move on."", 'Sugar overload! Sticky, tangy lemon and berry flavoured candy, the kind that stains your tongue every colour of the rainbow. Be careful with the nozzle, if you over-sprayed this then I\'d predict you would fast become the most hated person in the room.  Similar to this is ""La Cautiva"" by Fueguia 1833, except I find the latter to be less sugary; a more green and natural smelling blackcurrant and vanilla.', ""Based on the reviews, I was expecting this to be a softer, more mature version of Pink Sugar (which I love smelling on other people, but on me the licorice note is sharp and too pronounced).

I find it interesting that people associate Zagorsk with snow because usually when it\'s winter and snowy in Russia, there\'s no particular smells around, let alone ""green"" smells or smells of wood. So for me this is more of a spring/summer memory, when the sun is shining and it\'s still might be a bit chilly in the mornings but everything is already blooming. CDG nailed it, I have nothing else to say. Lovely poetic fragrance which evokes the long gone memories of peaceful times in Sergiyev Posad (Zagorsk).', ""First of all this is not a Woody (oriental) its a Leather fragrance, you can very much smell the Isobutyl Quinoline blended in with the Birch. The French always do this with Birch & it sh*ts me to be honest, another example is Creed Aventus they did it to that too, they'll always steer Birch in a Russian Leather direction and make it smell like Cuir de Leder. And hey look thats fine and all but just say what you mean, mean what you say, don't just call it Birch because when I think of Sweet Birch which is mainly Methyl Salicylate I'm preparing to smell the likes of Deep Heat or Ice gel physiotherapy in other words or prohibition a.k.a Birch Beer. After all that lovely fragrance buy it, they'll never out do COMME des GARCONS."", 'I adore Avignon and this is harder to find. Worth it, very cold and I‚Äôm one of those who gets the clove and nutmeg on their skin but to no detriment it‚Äôs amazing.  Nothing cosy festival hippy incense about it and it‚Äôs a go to on days when I want to feel calm or even aloof. I will seek out samples of the others but am keen to try Heeley fragrances too but so far Avignon is still my favourite incense.', ""It smells like the Chiclet peppermint gum you'd find in Arabic countries or Arabic stores. Another smell that describes it well is the smell of conifers/pinetrees in the middle of the woods, with an added kick of fresh mint. As it settles on my skin, the incense smell comes out more but it's still overwhelmingly a smell of pinetrees."", ""Smells just like a Russian Orthodox Church on first spray, with hints of a Birchwood bonfire. Perhaps it's Easter they're lighting one outside. (Sidenote, do the Orthodox have a bonfire on Easter or is it just us Catholics?) Tries down to a fairly generic spicy cologne scent- what I imagine the Russian version of Florida Water smells like. Something you'd buy at a corner store. Lasts forever, decent projection. A little masculine, but definitely still doable for a lady like me. Thank you CDG for letting me live out my Russophilic fantasies."", 'Even more cyprussy than Serge Lutens Fille en Aiguilles. Spicy, then pine. Smells like a high school woodwork room. A little clove detectable to me, a bit masculine for my tastes. The smell of an orthodox church. I feel like Draco Malfoy or someone would wear this. 3.5/5', ""I was alter serving at a church one time and they had a collection of incense from Holy Cross Monastery. There was some downtime and I smelled each can of incense they had. I don't remember which one it was but this smells EXACTLY like one of them. Dry, unburned incense in the can. If you don't know what incense in a can smells like, this fragrance is very pine spicy with some green freshness, and it has a bit of a menthol coldness to it also. Winter, pine forest, inside a cold sauna made from pine, incense burning. This smells great, however this has a big problem. Incredibly poor performance. Its basically gone in an hour. I wouldn't want to spent 100 on a full bottle for this weak performance. I really do like it and would get a full bottle but its just so weak. maybe the M01 trick could work but idk. Wouldn't recommend this just because of performance."", ""This is the ultimate goth kid scent, especially if you're on the masc side of the spectrum and enjoy listening to Siouxsie and Depeche Mode. It's melancholic, dark, ethereal. While resinous, it's not too sweet like some church-y alternatives I've tried, and it fortunately doesn't have any weird Catholic priest vibe. Love everything about this except for its longevity. It's gone in a matter of minutes.  9/10"", 'Smells like Catholicism Was super weak lasting on my skin :(', 'Starts off as a sweet wood, lightly pine. Immediately intriguing since I‚Äôve never smelled sweet woods done in this manner.  Not long after, it transitions into pencil shavings mostly. Mildly sweet at this point. Some vague memories of incense. Overall, the good doesn‚Äôt outweigh the bad. It‚Äôs an okay scent.', ""Smells exactly like synagogue to me. I feel as though this scent does a very good job in accomplishing what it wants to, but unfortunately it's not a smell I particularly enjoy. If you find nostalgia in the smell of a seder in temple then this scent is absolutely for you. Very well formulated and light while also being very distinctive and reminiscent."", ""While I haven't visited many eastern European countries, this scent transported me back to a very specific memory: a misty/foggy day in June, standing in Vladislav Hall in Prague Castle. Further memories evoked: the prisons of the Doge's Palace in Venice on a chilly December day, the coldness of the walls and surrounding enveloping you. Not quite a sterile scent, but solitary, like you're in an old European museum or church looking at paintings, sculptures, and architecture centuries older than yourself. Your family is just a few steps away, but in that moment, you are simply alone. I like it a lot. I really didn't expect such a specific memory to come to mind when I smelled it. Lasted 6 or so hours on my skin, though the sillage is a little weak."", 'I was honestly surprised with how good this is. Incense, pine, green- typical Comme Des Garcon style fragrance, a little left of field but definitely able to be a daily wear for Autumn and Winter. Great value as well. Big fan.', ""As someone who grew up in a relatively small town in north eastern poland I've had plenty of contact with ortodox christianity. I have never been to an ortodox church though. I remain in an interesting close/fantastic relation with that religion. I find this scent to be very melancholic, reminiscent of woody, forsaken, old, almost magical interiors. And interesting birch note should be there because I smell/see that too. Birch is a fairly common view in these neck of the woods. This scent is like an early morning dew in a foggy birch grove."", 'Interesting, ultimately just too powdery on me to sit with all day.', ""It's a masterpiece. Usually I'm allergic to those over-romanticised ideas and backstories behind fragrances, but the execution of this one is just insane. Melancholic, solitary, harsh atmosphere of an old wooden church in the middle of snowy nowhere is undeniable. That's the first time the perfume brought me an actual vision of that kind, it's truly remarkable to me. In that case, details like sillage, projection, drydown doesn't really matter. It took me for a brief moment to the different time and place and it's far more than I ever expected from a little bottle of smelly liquid. -If you want to learn about my approach to reviewing, please see my profile bio-"", ""An incense-based fragrance with a soapy, then woody and rather pleasant development which has me coming back for more. Revisiting this today, I am struck by that fresh-out-of-the-shower-and-into-the sauna vibe, which belies all the talk of cold churches in snowy landscapes! On me it lasts much longer than its sisters in the CDG incense series and the woody note in the tail (recalling the same house's Monocle 1: Hinoki) creates a deliciously Nordic dry down."", 'people talk about this as a younger brother to avignon‚Äôs golden child, but i would consider it more of the brooding cousin. less resinous and more woody, this composition speaks more to the dense snowy forest outside of the church than the interior space within. like bergman‚Äôs 1963 winter light zagorsk is eastern european, melancholy, and emblematic of the rustic masculine set amongst the perfect soul-searching pain of the environment around him. more dense and woody yet somehow less commanding and far more subtle, wear this to meet your long lost son at a train station in keiv, and to look in through a stained glass window on the outskirts of st petersberg on the day of his daughters confirmation. you see a small blurry light, dancing with merriment, you smell fire, you smell incense, but most of all you are despairingly cold.', ""So far I've tried this and Avignon, and I expected the latter to be my runaway favourite. However, I think Zagorsk has a cleanness and contrast to it that elevates it slightly higher for me than the more sweet, straightforward notes of Avignon. My initial impressions were of sharp pine and cold smoke, and I'm obsessed with how it dries down. Perhaps I'm doing Avignon a disservice due to the very small sample I'm working with, but Zagorsk is still the one I keep reaching for despite having a similarly tiny vial.  While I'll likely buy a full size of both to get more used to wearing them, I can see Zagorsk remaining my favourite going forward and becoming a staple of my wardrobe in the colder months. It also makes me very curious about the Orthodox incense that inspired it, since I'm someone who was raised primarily around Lutheran and Catholic churches, so Avignon is far more similar to what I'm used to.  I'd recommend this fragrance to folks who want a less typical churchy incense and who enjoy sharp, woodsy scents... and for any in the witchy and gothic crowd that want a more melancholy (to use CdG's word) incense fragrance than the lighter and sweeter Avignon."", 'I really like this! It smells like taking a walk in a pine forest in the winter. A bit like damp rocks and soap on the dry down. I do wish that wonderful blast of conifers in the opening lasted longer, but this is a nice, clean and meditative perfume.', 'it smells deadly serious and gravely calm. church/October/pine trees/cemetery/damp marble. not a dark scent; more like a misty foggy morning, overcast day.', 'To me, this is a much more woody and less spicy version of Avignon. Based off my preferences, I wrongly assumed that I would like Zagorsk the most out of the three CDG Incense samples I tried, but Avignon clearly wins. Kyoto is a whole different scent profile from these two IMO but still not my favorite. Zagorsk has pretty good performance (about 6 hours) but the pine tree almost overwhelms all the other notes. I do still enjoy this one, because I always gravitate towards woody scents, but Avignon is overall more complex and unique to me. I was hoping this would be signature scent material because the packaging fits my aesthetic so well, but I think if I had to choose a full bottle purchase from the incense it would be Avignon over Zagorsk.', 'The opening is like getting into a beautiful forest where the green of pine trees absorbs you completely for a couple of minutes. It soon settles as a lovely woodsy note with a hint of incense. Very wearable, quite discreet. It could be unisex, although I see it better worn by a man. A gorgeous fragrance.', ""Not a typical incense fragrance. Feels more like a clean/fresh, subtly spicy pine scent, which I'm enjoying. Violet and iris are the surprising characters here and contribute an airy, open, and soft texture to the composition. Pimento is also rather uncommon but I can pick out it's prickly heat, and sometimes it feels like the juice you would get from a crushed pepper- crisp, alive, refreshing, and a little vegetal. It's good but feels like an experiment in contrasting notes that doesn't wow me. The pine and incense feel subdued and I get a wet-wood impression that I've smelled with hinoki and certain combinations of birch and makes it feel like a crisp, floral pepper."", ""Avignon gets all of the love... and it is a great perfume. But Zagorsk is my #1 from the entire CDG Incense series.  Actually, it's my favorite coniferous fragrance to date. Admittedly I haven't sampled very many fragrances in this category--and I'm not sure I really need to since Zagorsk appears to still be in production.  It works well in the winter, especially if you're of the opinion that cold-weather fragrances don't need to be weighed down with sweetness, oud accords, or both. There are no ham-fisted sugary afterthought notes thrown into this mix. The pine note here is ethereal and not the least bit heavy or tarry. It's from the mid-to-upper canopy, not the forest floor. For me it shines best and brightest in the summertime. But really, it's just all-out beautiful no matter which season."", 'If you‚Äôve ever put your nose in a bag of actual frankincense that they use in orthodox churches, unburned, this is EXACTLY how this smells. It doesn‚Äôt catch the smell of the woods or the myrrh or the wine or the bread or the gold and the velvets, but it smells exactly like the incense itself alone. I find this one to be the most ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù from the line, I really get the pencil shavings scent that a lot of people seem to talk about. I also find it to be the most simple and no-frills, straightforward incense. It‚Äôs cold, dry, bitter incense. There‚Äôs really something very enchanting about how simple and COLD this perfume is. No other scent has ever made me physically cold like this one! It feels like you‚Äôre in the middle of an endless arctic forest, though I don‚Äôt really see the embellished cathedrals of Zagorsk with this, it‚Äôs a more small modest middle of nowhere kind of church. I can‚Äôt get out of my head that this is how Tarkovsky‚Äôs film ‚ÄúAndrei Rublev‚Äù must smell. Not a safe blind buy, it smells so cold and dry and bitter and dusty that it‚Äôs hard to perceive it as a person‚Äôs scent, as incredible as it is.', 'My favourite of the line! So mysterious and enchanting!! Why did they discontinue this masterpiece?!!!', ""Perhaps my favourite of the Incense series (although I wear Avignon and Kyoto more often). I don't get carrot from it, but do get nutmeg, which I associate with carrot soup. I'm not sure this has been discontinued @nisz_snob. It is hard to get, but does come back into stock from time to time. I have been keeping an eye on the Selfridges and Liberty websites here in London and a single bottle just popped up on Selfridges (which wasn't there earlier this week) and so I grabbed it as a back up. The more niche CdG scents seem to come into stock in very small quantities, so you can easily miss them and then they don't reappear for months. Not sure what the supply issue is."", 'huge shame that is disconitued.. i love that carroty incense <3', 'wet rock and carrots and I like it', 'If I was to say this is a strange combination of powdery, piercing, herbal, milky and soapy, and synasthetically evokes a snowy white, as well as a sense of froideur and rather bleak, isolated, rocky, wintry snowy landscapes; and, at the same time, smells uncannily like raw parsnip ‚Äì well that makes this fragrance sound awful!  However, I adore it. Love at first sniff! I\'m going to buy a full bottle on the basis of a couple of sprays. I find this fragrance wonderfully soothing.  Subtle sweetness and leather dominate during dry down, which is of rapid onset, like, 10 minutes after initial application; beyond which point it is all perfectly linear, and not the less lovely for that. The powdery/milky/herbal clean soapiness continues to linger.  The ""parsnip"" note, obviously, is not listed. I swear it is there, quite distinct. I do find it a genuinely pleasant note, but then I do think raw parsnip smells quite good. Maybe I\'m a weirdo. This note seems to add some grounding to the sweetness and cold, piercing quality of the whole. It brings the blend together, kinda anchors it. My partner and I sometimes refer to this frag as ""the parsnip perfume"". And we both love it! Sillage and longevity both seem moderate to good, though bearing in mind I\'ve only worn this for a couple of hours so far. We\'ll see... love it, though, 9.5/10.', 'Fresh, clean and a whole lot of carrots. I get pine needles and fresh carrots. It is probably the iris that is the culprit. Not a like for me.', ""Comme des Garcons Series 3: Incense Zagorsk is the 'cleanest' incense in this line, at least to my nose. I don't find the composition overly smoky or incense-driven, to be honest, it smells like a herbal, fresh blend of pine, cedar, pimento, iris and olibanum. Although unisex, Zagorsk leans slightly masculine with dense woodsy accords and dusty, unsweetened floral notes. This fragrance projects a sense of 'coldness' and calm. It's not as ethereal as Avignon or as warm and spicy as Jaisalmer. Zagorsk brings to mind cold, smooth pebbles and crisp, wintry sea breeze.  Admittedly I prefer spicier, richer incense fragrances, however, I do appreciate Zagorsk for being a more versatile incense that can be easily worn during Spring or Summer. Perhaps the only downside to Zagorsk is its lacklustre projection on the skin. The scent stays very close to the skin and dissipates quickly. Occasionally I catch wafts of it as it comes and goes, but for the most part, this is a relatively intimate fragrance. I am not enamoured with Zagorsk, but I find it oddly soothing and relaxing. I don't follow any particular religion, so the fact that it is said to replicate the incense used in Russian orthodox churches doesn't mean much to me. If anything, I find it quite 'outdoorsy' and clean."", ""a fresh clean woody soapy incense the opening smells pretty natural to me, like freshly cut woody shrubs oozing sap  after a couple hours it goes a little synthetic, which wasn't my favorite phase  in the late dry down the woods reappear and it also smells a little mossy"", 'Zagorsk is one of my favourite cold weather perfumes. It is peaceful, transcendent, unique. Comforting and loving, present but not dominant, nostalgic in a way. There is something extraordinary about this perfume that transports me to peace, tranquility and hope. Best during colder months, especially winter.', 'The opening is GREAT. Very nice and attention-grabbing, with pines and incense feel. But in the drydown it becomes a bit too subtle and a bit carroty. Still somewhat comforting though. If anyone knows of a perfume that smells like that opening all the way through, please PM me! :)', 'This is a masterpiece: it\'s a real olibanum, and yes, it brings a vivid feeling of visiting an ortodox church in the cold season.  It is exactly because of this direct association with a church I had some doubts about this fragrance before the very first purchase. But on a skin it gets some warm shadows, and does not sound too ""spiritual"" :).  It also has some therapical effect, as it calms the mind and keeps your head clean. I have bought a second flacon of it.', 'I sampled all of the CdG Series 3 Incense and Zagorsk was the coziest, most powdered, almost clean soap like to me. There is a lot of orris root in here. Reminds me of the interior of an old quality handbag.', ""Another beautiful incense fragrance. Darker, deeper, cooler, wet and kind of dirty. I didn't really know what to say at first and I thought about it for a long while. I think I love it as much as Avignon, but for a different reason. Avignon is for me a nostalgic perfect recreation of my favorite smell in the world. Avignon isn't very powerful or long lasting, but it's accuracy is incredible. Here, with Zagorsk, I wasn't sure what I should expect. I have been to an Orthodox church before, but not while it was being incensed, so I didn't have a memory bank of information to go to when I smelled it. It's green, woody, a bit smoky and quite dark/cool. It warms up a bit as it sits, but really for me this is an angsty fragrance. A bit bitter, contemplative, aged. Definitely agree with alfarom's review: it's dark, green and cold. Really mysterious. Evokes for me the idea of Orthodox monks living in the forest alone, contemplating God. I think it's beautiful. 9/10"", 'A woody gently smokey incense scent. I find it very calming and contemplative in small doses. Would appeal to a Bulgari Black lover', 'This is how I wished Iris Silver Mist to smell like. Beautiful pale melancholic scent.', 'Not my favourite in the lncense line. A strange carrot-like note that floats above and dominates the otherwise beautiful woody base ruins the whole composition for me. Incense is nowhere to be found.', 'I agree with others who state Zagorsk doesn\'t present as a ""true"" incense fragrance, certainly not the type most Westerners are accustomed to. This fragrance smells very herbal, almost harshly so (at least to my nose...certainly upon opening). So, the opening notes are quite intense where I perceive lots of cedar, cypress, pine and some sharp berries. Zagorsk does open like many typical fougere fragrances with lots \'n lots of forest, greenery, fern & pine...small, faint elements of dry incense intermittently break through upon application and throughout the first 5 minutes or so. Mid notes emerge within 5 minutes and absolutely morph with and change the original opening notes. I like the middle phase of this fragrance. Unlike the other CdG Incense Fragrances I\'ve tried, (or smelled), little floral whisps of violet try breaking through the mass of pine and cedar throughout the middle phase of this fragrance. While extremely faint, the fragrant violet is a pleasant & balancing element and one of the more pleasing aspects of this fragrance, IMHO. Finally, like many ""incense"" fragrances, Zagorsk settles at base with woody, birch, rather typical ""wood"" notes. Some incense notes pop through on occasion. Not at all resinous, like what one might come to expect with an incense fragrance, Zagorsk is a bit powdery and cloud like. As incense fragrances go, I think Zagorsk is a relatively ""easy"" fragrance to wear. And I like this fragrance, I do. However, similar to all the CdG Incense Series fragrances I\'ve smelled and/or sampled, Zagorsk is not something I would ever purchase, or wear on a regular basis. While on my skin, Zagorsk is the most femininely appealing, or ""unisex"" of all the CdG Incense fragrances, I still think Zagorsk (and all the Incense Series fragrances) is decidedly masculine. While I love the CdG ""Incense"" concept and I appreciate many of the ""Incense"" fragrances and notes, none in this CdG series have worked for me. For me, every CdG incense fragrance I\'ve tried has just been to ""church-y"" for my tastes and definitely way too masculine leaning. And for the price point (and like the others Incense fragrances), Zagorsk has limited silage, limited longevity and minimal staying power on my skin. It\'s expensive stuff and I like it but it\'s just not my style.', ""I do really adore this scent...BUT.....the performance is awful. Just inexcusable -- and thats really a shame. Its a stunning mysterious contemplative combination of pine and cedar and birch. There is an incense smokiness that lingers after the opening and i find it just seductive. I was raving about Olivier Durbano's Heliotrope the other day...and this ...sort of counter intuitively....reminds me a bit of that. Maybe its the chile/pimento thing. I dont know. But you have to hurry to figure out these notes because in twenty minutes its all gone. There is a sense of church, of the ceremonial and sacred....and if there were even slightly better performance Id buy this again in a second."", 'Is anyone else getting ‚Äúcarrot soup‚Äù note?', 'Really nice, but it‚Äôs like Guerlain Vetiver 90%. Hard to complain, but I wanted to smell a Hinoki wood and birch.', ""In the quest for the perfect incense fragrance, Zagorsk often gets recommended. The raw, lemony-smokey incense that most people in Western countries are used to (Avignon, Sahara Noir) is not to be found in Zagorsk. Instead, a pine-like, cold, crisp, resinous (almost powdery) accord is what Zagorsk offers, which is quite accurately described by the accompanying marketing. The scent is supposed to immitate a snow-covered Russian Monastery in the city of the same name. It remains quite linear throughout and develops little to my nose. The Russian-style incense is totally justified in my opinion, so most Orthodox people might feel at home with this scent. But this is no 'one size fits all' incense. However, it may well be one of the most appropriate cold-weather scent in a long time: one that is zero sweet and a million miles from oriental ambers or ouds. Comme des Garcons should be praised for their objective to create a fragrance for each of the world's largest religions, although I wouldn't associate Russian Orthodox with everything Orthodox Christian. That said, this scent is one of the closest things a fragrance can get to without actually burning anything. Therefore, it gets the thumbs up from me. Other similar scents to check out might be Polo RL for the pine note (although quite different to Zagorsk) and Amouage Jubilation XXV and Breath of God by LUSH for incense in general."", 'I am getting a strong clove note, but I know that it is not listed in the list of notes. Maybe the incense note is clove incense? but there is also a coniferous chord..... b-flat. Just heavenly.', 'As I liked the Kyoto scent of the same line, I was eager to try ""Zagorsk"" when I read the ingredients, conifers, woods, and iris combined with incense - sounds fantastic. When I sprayed it on I first really liked it, as there really were conifer trees, birch, a hint of incense smoke, very nice. But sadly, after 10 minutes, this scent turns in an almost pure vetiver scent, I mean a real vetiver bomb actually. I like vetiver, as one of my husband\'s favourite scents for years has been Guerlain\'s ""Vetiver"". And Zagorsk actually turns in a Guerlain Vetiver twin. So, this is a really good scent, but I\'m a bit annoyed that vetiver isn\'t even listed in the ingredients while it is the dominant part in that scent. And for me it\'s definitely a masculine scent, a Guerlain Vetiver-clone and I just don\'t want to smell exactly like my husband\'s EdT.

They are such different fragrances. I‚Äôm Roman Catholic, and smelling this makes it hard to believe Orthodox could be even remotely related. I get no frankincense at all, and it really smells nothing like any other type of incense I‚Äôve ever smelled. It‚Äôs not a bad fragrance, but it wasn‚Äôt what I was looking for.

I tried to draw my arm and a most melancholy voice sobbed \'let me in- let me in!\' .....\'Who are you?\' i asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself. \'Catherine Linton\'!! ...it replied shiveringly, \'i\'m come home:i d lost my way on the moor!\'....\'let me in!!!!\'.... \'Begone!!!\' i shouted, i ll never let you in, not if you beg for twenty years\'. \'It is twenty years\', mourned the voice:\'twenty years....I ve been a waif for twenty years......\' "" Emily Bronte, ""Wuthering heights"".', 'Woody from the very beginning, slightly smoky note of birch revealing a hint of green pine needles. I was expecting the typical refreshing resinous pine outburst but in reality this note only gives you a general feeling of green plants releasing their smell in the woods while you are stepping on thin wood and leaves. Then the olibanum kicks in with some sweet resinous hint. It makes me think slightly of incense but a very woody one, not the typical incense they burn in Catholic Churches. All in all an interesting fragrance although I would not know when to use it. The smell of wood is very good but in this fragrance it can become slightly stale after a while.', ""It's a mistake to assume that every CDG Incense is, like Avignon, an attempt to replicate the actual smell of a given church; not that I'm familiar with Orthodox churches at all, but Zagorsk definitely does not give off an indoorsy vibe. Rather, thanks to the dominant pine sap note in particular, it feels distinctly natural, full of the sort of at once robust and mysterious smells you'd imagine accompanying a druidic ritual. The incense is really not what you come to see with Zagorsk, but it's the perfect foundation to tie it all together.  That said, it does the same thing after about an hour on my (relatively dry) skin as every other CDG I've tried thus far, which is to fade away into a soft, incense-y shadow of itself. I suppose some people might welcome this, if they're inclined to think of the opening as too strong, but for my part I always find myself hoping that a nominally niche fragrance will be more resistant to settling down so safely. That's just me, though; those of you who don't want to reek like they've rolled around on the forest floor all day long will probably be fine with it."", ""Zagorsk is not my favorite cdg incense but it's damn good. I picture a russian church, blanketed in snow, surounded by coniferous trees. The opening is very interesting. There is spiciness but overall it smells remarkably cold to me. Almost slightly metallic, like cold metal. The pine incense combo creates a strangely transparent, almost clovey airiness over top. This opening lasts a very long time, almost hours but eventually the pepper and other woods emerge from hibernation and it becomes much more inviting. The drydown is interestingly contradictory. Theres the cold airiness of the opening but theres also a spicy coziness. In the opening you're trudging through the freezing taiga. After hours of walking you finally see in the distance a large, gothic cathedral. The drydown comes as soon as you enter it and slam the large, heavy door closed. You can still sense the cold, biting air outside, but it is muted by the heavy wooden door and the warm scent of incense and a cozy fire within. While I love this, for some reason I dont feel the urge to wear it very often. Maybe it's a little too serious, lacking in charm. Performance is on par with the other incenses, being above average in both duration and sillage. All in all this gets a 7.5/10 from me for its transportive, if overly sombre qualities."", ""Overall: 9/10 Here's Why: Sad. Rustic. Dreary. Slow Burn.  I've never smelt something like this before.  It's transporting. It tells a story.  The Pine and pepper linger behind a strong birch and frankincense. Iris and Violet take the backseat.  It's masculine, but young. fresh and stale at the same time.  It's a beautiful and polarizing smell.  The juice is wonderful, and it tells a story. It's deep and layered, bitter and sweet. It's full of contradictions and it shouldn't work. for my skin, it was magic.  Does not play well with others.  A little too morbid to wear daily, but it's special."", 'dusty old book of magic in a greeny English fern secret garden. i can still sense Comme des Garcons stamp in this.', ""A deep, austere, slightly sweet scent that brings to mind a snowy, Russian forest. My second favorite behind Kyoto, but like most of the incense series, Zagorsk isn't an easy wear. I'll be sure to reach for it if I ever want to sit in the woods and read Dostoyevski."", ""This one is better for the colder seasons, I think, but it's surprisingly fresh for a scent with this much (frank)incense. Those smoky notes dominate on my skin, but they dominate subtly, if that makes any sense; they're balanced out so beautifully by the greener notes. The smell evokes a walk through a nordic kind of forest in the fall: lots of pines and birch trees and dark wet earth, and somewhere nearby someone is burning incense. It's great, cold and warm at the same time. So I guess I'm experiencing this like it's meant, maybe with some help from the suggestion of the name: it does remind me of (an idea of) Russia or northern Scandinavia."", 'I don`t know about the other commenters and their experiences, but this scent is so nostalgic to me, and smells exactly like churches of my childhood in my homecountry -- the insense mixed with the cold stony smell of the old church walls...to me it hits the nail on the head with Orthodoxy. I love the scent, but I am not sure if I would really ever wear it; this is for someone really bold and confident to be worn as a perfume, but then again, that is what the Comme des Garcons perfume philosophy is all about - avantgard, excentric, unexpected, unusual. I think I will eventually purchase it and experiment with wearing it.', 'I like Zagorsk, but what I feel in it is not listed in the official notes breakdown. First spray on my skin and... Cloves. I feel like I\'m at the dentists at the moment sitting at the chair. Strange, isn\'t it? It\'s somewhat similar to ""cloves factor"" in Loewe 7, but less synthetic, or rather less in your face, I\'d say. It soon gets softened by mild florals(I guess these are iris and violet but I might be wrong). The pine is there too, but it\'s not one of the main compounds, it rather plays supporting role. Later on incense swoops in, but it\'s also very ""7-ish"". I know that Zagorsk was released first, but I know 7 longer. The later, the more I\'m starting to feel ""Coca-Cola"" like smell. Weird, isn\'t it? Coca-Cola, pine, cloves and incense. Strange and interesting. Well, I attend to the catholic church each week and smell of Zagorsk in not ""that"" type of incense, for sure. Will update soon.', ""Great review below from Dr Kool. :) I have no idea what authentic Orthodox Russian church incense smells of? I'd assumed CDG had done some research? maybe they had? Perhaps the sample churches they chose smelled like this? or maybe a cock up and this incense range was labelled incorrectly? maybe zagorsk is supposed to be jaisalmer as he suggests....I love this one all the same and has been a recent addition to my wardrobe but I can't wear it yet as for me it's not warming enough for winter...will be lovely in spring I reckon."", 'This is possibly the best of the pine fragrances I\'ve tried so far, which include Sugi, Fille en Aiguilles, and Hinoki. By ""pine fragrances"" I mean the ones that have very prominent pine or cypress notes. In this case, the perfumer has managed to prevent it from smelling like household cleaning products. Regarding longevity, I put on two sprays one morning and my girlfriend could smell it when I got in her car 8 hours later. As good as this fragrance is, it doesn\'t smell like Russian Orthodox incense, and I will explain: Russian monasteries use a lot of benzoin in their incense, which is why it\'s so sweet. The benzoin is added to powdered frankincense resin and whatever oils are in the particular blend they\'re making. These include rose, honeysuckle, lily of the valley, cinnamon, and many others. In fact, Comme des Garcons Jaisalmer (the Hindu fragrance from the same series) smells almost identical to Russian Orthodox incense (and smells nothing like Indian incense!) To be fair, I suppose we shouldn\'t assume it was the perfumer\'s goal to mimic liturgical incense. Also, the birch and pine notes do reflect the trees found in Russian forests, although a truly Russian fragrance would also have beeswax, honey, and castoreum, which were some of the Kievan realm\'s main exports in Medieval times I should also mention that this is cold pine, which is probably the effect of the iris note. This is a solemn fragrance. If you like pine but want it warm, go for Fille en Aiguilles.', 'Being a Russian Orthodox Christian, living in the US for many years, I miss the scent of my church in Moscow and tend to look for it in perfumes and aromatherapy. I was so excited to find out about Zagorsk. But it fell somewhat short for me. Initially I smelled gauze bandages, now the most prominent scent is beeswax candles that are used in Orthodox church, however, that is not how my church smells like. Maybe Zagorsk (now Sergiev Posad) monastery smells like this, I do not remember (I only visited it once). Seems like a tiny village church might smell like this. I like Zagorsk enough to keep it, yet, it is not reminiscent of my Orthodox church experience in Russia and I do not crave it. Edit: despite all that, Zagorsk became my fragrance of choice to wear to church. It seems to be the most appropriate scent from my wardrobe, most perfumes seem out of place there.', 'Boy, tough break for Zagorsk considering how much everyone loves the other four! It\'s definitely got the deep, dark pine forest going on right from the first whiff...makes me think of Polo almost. I find it to be a very natural, organic confer scent, even after it moves indoors, into the log cabin, losing some of the brisk coldness after a minute or two. This is what life smelled like in remote Hudson Bay Company forts in the wilds of 18th century Canada, pipe tobacco and all. It\'s slowly getting sweeter, with a single sweet note, almost like grassy vanilla, that stands out like the spring shoots reaching up through the last of the snow in March. But after the woods from the top notes dissipate more, this grassy vanilla note does get a bit one-dimensional, almost like a He Wood flanker. The dynamic, fresh-hewn log cabin smell ages a few hundred years to leave that sweeter but heavily-worn remnant that you smell when you visit that same old fort today, on a tour at a national park. If you took all the gourmand elements out of Zirh Corduroy, or maybe even out of Rocabar, you\'d be left with something like this. It\'s much less ""my thing"" than some of the others in the series, but I\'ll still give it a thumbs up because I think it\'s well-balanced for the sweet antique wood genre.', ""This is a serene, peaceful fragrance...the pine and birch tar perfectly complement the frankincense, this is the last stop on my CDG Incense trail and it's been an eye opening, whistle stop tour around the world.  I've reached the conclusion that I love incense when surrounded by other notes in complex compositions the likes of Amouage epic, memoir and interlude. Another reason I like them is they have a smokiness, I honestly couldn't describe any of these as being smokey with the exception of Kyoto and Zagorsk which have a mild smokey texture but I was expecting more.  Again, not that I'm complaining this collection has more than delivered and educated me about different faiths and the smells associated with them. Hats off to Comme de Gar√ßons!!!"", 'This peaceful fragrance is perfect for an aromatherapy, especially when one needs concentration, as it keeps the mind clear (actually, it\'s an effect of olibanum, which could be purchased as an oil or in it\'s pure form). The question is, where to wear such a ""spiritual fragrance"", as an association with the church is too evident (especially for those who live in the countries with dominating Orthodox or Catholic churches).  So I just enjoy it as an abstract aroma, not as a perfume.', ""Wow... Give me few minutes. I take a slap in the face, and then, I'll review it ! O_O"", ""An old stone church deep in the mossy woods just after a rain. I put my nose to the lichen-encrusted stone wall. How can a perfume smell like damp stone? I don't know, but it does. There is light smoky incense there too, but it is the damp stone that stands out for me. Not something you would buy to wear around town or to work, but wonderfully evocative and I must salute Comme des Garcon for releasing such a unique scent."", 'Violets and birch tar and young pine needles. And frankincense ‚Äì rather light and therefore not really typical for an idea of truly depicting an atmosphere of orthodox church. This is for me a smell of an abandoned village church ‚Äì slightly musty and dusty, a truly melancholic smell of neglect and desertion ‚Äì and I‚Äôve had a vast experience with Russian Orthodox churches ‚Äì both grand and neglected.  Nevertheless, I do like Zagorsk: it is much more original compared to Avignon, the projection and silage in both is equally rather moderate on me.', ""I am standing in a forest: it's a cold, overcast day. The smell of smoke or incense is wafting from somewhere in the distance...I decide to put my nose right up to a birch tree and take a big whiff!! I'm not sure why I would stick my nose up to a tree, but that is exactly the sensation I get with Zagorksk: cold, dry, in-your-face birch wood. As it dries down, more of the sweet frankincense emerges. The dryness of the top note along with the sweetness of the incense note call to mind the contrast between the spirituality of nature and spirituality found in a place of worship built by human hands. It smells very sacred...and a little eerie...I don't think I want to be in this cold forest by myself anymore... Overall, I feel the same way about Zagorsk as I feel about Annick Goutal's Encens Flamboyan -- a very intriguing scent that evokes strange places and pensive moods, but not something I want as a personal fragrance."", ""I have never been in a Russian Orthodox church, but I used to attend weekly Catholic Mass with my family and sometimes the priest would burn incense on certain days. This reminds me a lot of that scent, which I found very pleasant and comforting. This conjures up memories of being a child and sitting cozily between my mom and grandma at Mass. It also reminds me a lot of a cold winter day, and sometimes I will get a whiff of what smells like a campfire. It's very smoky, but on my skin, no pine scent really appears. I like this quite a bit for its originality, but I agree with the reviewer who said this is a scent she'd wear at home for herself and not out. I don't think I'd have the courage to wear this in public, but at home it's nice and calming, especially before bed."", 'Peaceful, transcendent, unique - perfect perfume for colder months, especially cold winter. It reminds me of snow, cold, frost, pines, small wooden church somewhere in the forest.  On my skin, unfortunately, too much violet and flowery notes appear. Moreover, some people say they smell carrot.', 'This indeed smells like Russian churches, the smell evokes fear in me, some kind of melancholy. This is a great fragrance but not for outside use, only for your self at home.', ""I love the incense range! This is just beautiful! On me it's absolutely a comforting scent. I smell the pine, the resins and sap of trees, I smell frankincense and the earth of a forest floor. It's very sweet too, I do get the iris on me, but thankfully no smokiness. Want one now!"", ""The opening smells smoky, bit like Guerlain Vetiver type of smokiness. I also get tones of pimento. After few minutes there is a woody smell, rather than the common fragrance wood such as cedar wood or sandalwood, you'll smell the same type of wood that you would smell when you open a furniture kit from IKEA. Pretty unique scent, but I can't relate it to incense nor see my self wearing it."", 'I tried Zagorsk several months ago and thought ""meh, mace."" My least favorite out of all the CdG incense. Opinions aren\'t interesting. Observations are.  Here is the scene from last night: an American and two Parisians are sitting in the guest flat in for an international artist residency in a remote concrete suburb of Yerevan, Armenia. Littering the table around which social life revolves are boxes of cigarettes, coffee cups, a plate of chopped tarragon, a colander of radishes, eggshells, a 100 gram bag of what appear to be little quartz rocks purchased from the battery and pencil section of the local supermarket, and a roll of cylindrical basalt-colored briquettes that beckon from an open package cryptically bearing a single line in English: ""charcoals without problem."" Ah, Russian. Your literal translations never cease to enchant.  A briquette is placed on a cast iron dish, as if it were an after-dinner mint one were preparing to offer a pot-bellied stove, and this is placed on the table. A sprinkling of the quartz rocks tops the charcoal that is thought to be so unburdened by worry and a match is struck and held close. We wait. Defective? Suddenly sparks fly and a column of white smoke erupts toward the ceiling as we all dive for cover. Windows are flung open and the smell hanging in the room is Zagorsk.', ""Something about Comme des Gar√ßons Incense Series 3 ZAGORSK does not sit well on my skin‚Äîor in my lungs. There can be no denying that this is an incense perfume, but it hits me quite a bit differently than KYOTO. ZAGORSK, too, is not very oily or resinous, but the wood of the incense seems more bitter than burnt and slightly rubbery as well.  Like KYOTO, ZAGORSK is also devoid of detectable floral notes, but this composition seems quite a bit more masculine to me. The sillage is rather big for a masculine scent, but this will be perhaps welcome to those who like the peculiar quality of the composition, although I'm wondering how many people would really want to be around other people who smell like this.  I do not mean to suggest that ZAGORSK is repellent, but on the other hand I myself do not find it very appealing at all, and my distinct impression is that, if over-applied, this fragrance might have a mildly suffocating effect‚Äîsomething like breathing at high altitude where oxygen is in short supply or inhabiting an old building with traces of asbestos in the attic. D√©sol√©e."", ""One word - pews. And why not? There's nothing wrong with pews. I like perfumes that transport me somewhere else. It's lovely but not as easy to buy as Avignon which is sweeter- very nice too but personally I find zagorsk more enchanting."", ""I don't know if this perfume reacts in a very peculiar way on me but I smell almost none of the listed notes, and smell a whole lot else. Firstly I do smell pine, and possible cedar too, but instead of any of it's floral notes what I get is constant and intense smokiness. I get hints of birch tar and burnt paper, and also a strong wiff of freshly extinguished matches. I don't get any Iris or violet. After a while this perfume (which despite it's oddness I do rather like) becomes damp and mouldy smelling, like an old mahogany closet in the attic. There is something haunting and weird and elemental about Zagorsk which it took me time to adapt to. After a while it transported me to some tumbledown ancient wooden orthodox church in Siberia where the trees crowd about darkly, and the snow melt dampens everything and where wood and the smells of charcoal, earth, lit tapers and clean dirt and dust fill the air. This is a very unusual and very magical scent which is worth owning even if one cannot wear it often. It's certainly not as wearable as Avignon (which I adore), but it's a hell of a lot more interesting than Kyoto or Jaisalmer. Like the rest of this range it's sheer and light and its sillage is only fair, as is its longevity, but the bottles are a handy size to carry about so you can always re-apply."", 'Wintery. Cold, damp earth in the middle of a forest.', ""On my skin I mainly get birch and carrots, not much incense at all which surprised me. It's a silent, cool scent that tells a story in a way, it calms my nerves. I come from the northern parts of Sweden, so I totally get this minimalistic call of nature. It reminds me of climbing trees as a child, the woodsy, sappy parts of this scent really resembles the woods where I come from. It also reminds me of my mothers homegrown carrots, pulled from the soil, brushed off and piled in the fridge. The smell you get from snapping an ice cold homegrown carrot in half is right there. Zagorsk is an amazing composition of scents that really touches my heart."", 'My ex boyfriend wore this one...to me it is like an evergreen, fresher and less sweet Avignon. Love the collection, but Avignon is the absolute, quintessential incense out there. Zagorsk smells clean in all of it smokiness, but something sterile comes from it that leaves me totally cold.', ""It's quite an intense incense fragrance. I smell a lot of olibanum, cedar, and pine, but I can also feel a subtle sharpness from the pimento. Fortunately, I don't find the pimento to be a prominent note on my skin, and as an olibanum lover, I appreciate how this intensely woody fragrance makes me feel grounded. There is also something unexpectedly cool and fresh about incense scents in the intense summer heat. I suppose they remind me of winter!"", 'My favorite. Sring. Summer. Fall. Winter.', 'If you like the hinoki cypress smell I think Zagorsk is a much better interpretation of the theme than it actually is Monocle Scent 01 by the same house. A dark-green coniferous base (pine and hinoki) mixed with the most chilling and stark frankincense around. Minimalistic and austerely distinctive but incredibly compelling as well. One of my favourite incenses of all time. Highly recommended! Rating: 8.5/10', ""I must have a skin chemistry issue here because I mainly get chilli, but more vegetal than spice. The incense is smoky and reminiscent of the forest camp fire and is just lovely. I only wish I had more of the pine resin others speak of. Interesting comination but I like my incense perfumes to be cosy. This on me is too unbalanced so I find myself somewhat distracted by it rather than comforted. Thanks Scorpiosheep for this sample. It's been a great ride!"", 'All about pine and fir balsam with a tiny curl of incense smoke, the opening notes of Zagorsk really do evoke the image of a tiny Russian church in the middle of a huge dark fir forest on a cold snowy night. As the scent warms a little it becomes greener and the image changes to the inside of the church, constructed out of fir wood, decorated with freshly cut evergreen branches, and scented with the smoke of a small amount of subtly spicy incense that‚Äôs being burned for a ceremony.  As time goes on, it warms even more, revealing a soft violet/iris scent that‚Äôs still very green, becoming progressively sweeter and spicier. To me, this phase evokes pastel colored violet flavored candies. There‚Äôs quite a bit of sillage, especially in the violet phase. Zagorsk does a complete about-face, evolving from a cool and stark evergreen-laden woody incense to a violet floral that‚Äôs sweet and soft, although it does maintain an undercurrent of evergreen leaves and wood. I love the first act, with its woody incense, but the second act with its sweet violets becomes cloying after a while, especially since it has amazing staying power.', 'This one went all the way where Prada Infusion d\'Homme chickened out. It is based on the same bitter herbal note (which is parsley to me), but this note is here complemented by manly and sophisticated mixture of leather, tobacco and incense. The tobacco note here is definitely the one of smoked tobacco rather than dry leaf (read ""cigarette butts"" - but in the best possible sense).', 'I am underwhelmed by this...not because of the quality per se but probably because I put it on too high a pedestal in my expectations. Honestly, at first it reminds me of classic ""Grandma"" perfume - omnipresent cough-inducing sweetness. After a while I could almost sense the ""snow/cold"" note a lot of people mention - but it was so fleeting I didn\'t know if it was my imagination. Incense, yes...especially in the way it pervades everything around you like a veil of olfactory fog(you can almost see the smoke when smelling this). But the only ""Russian"" association I got from it was mens\' aftershave from the soviet union. It\'s not unpleasant by any means...just for me feels absolutely nothing like the description.', ""Classic incense, right down to the resin and smoke.

One of my favourite incenses of all time. Highly recommended! Rating: 8.5/10', ""Avignon gets all of the love... and it is a great perfume. But Zagorsk is my #1 from the entire CDG Incense series.  Actually, it's my favorite coniferous fragrance to date. Admittedly I haven't sampled very many fragrances in this category--and I'm not sure I really need to since Zagorsk appears to still be in production.  It works well in the winter, especially if you're of the opinion that cold-weather fragrances don't need to be weighed down with sweetness, oud accords, or both. There are no ham-fisted sugary afterthought notes thrown into this mix. The pine note here is ethereal and not the least bit heavy or tarry. It's from the mid-to-upper canopy, not the forest floor.

Reminds me of my time in NYC in my 20s when I was reckless and everything was fun, especially at night. Hear a lot of complaint about the synthetic nature of this scent and I don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs as sexy now as it was when I bought my first bottle blind at Barney‚Äôs on the Upper East Side . Dark, but not standoffish. Mysterious, but not obtuse. Unique, but not so eccentric it‚Äôs a freak show (looking at you Aedes de Venustas Signature).  This one still turns heads and gets compliments and gets you laid. More people ask me what I‚Äôm wearing when I wear this than anything else.

It's somehow green from the tea and davana (?) but also dark and grounded, leathery. Not for me, but an intriguing scent."", ""This is very green, unique scent with old school influences. The big bold spirit of 80's: Cinnamon, bergamot, tea, hibiscus and ambers are the ones that stands out the most. 80's barbershop start, herbal floral dyrdown and pure, soft amber finish.

I thought maybe I try it again because she has done 180s with other scents but no. Every time I wore this she knew exactly what I was wearing. Now it's collecting dust. So interesting because I think this is one of the best from the house and one of the best tea note based fragrances on the market that doesn't get any hype whatsoever.

It may have been COVID, or the bottle or my nose developing, but this one did. At first I needed to immediately scrub it off, but after more than a year in storage, an AMBER-WOODY beauty emerged. Scent Intense has a thick, resinous and incense-y amber with a sweet tea & hibiscus note in the air. (Benefits from dark storage after first sprays to really blossom and sweeten - a year or more). Contrast to Bentley for Men Intense: These are different but similar with the thick, resinous amber. The tea note in the air sweetens as it dries down coming close to the plum-y rum note in BFMI.  Contrast to Ambre Lumiere Molinard:  These are different, but again the thick, sweet and resinous amber is similar. AL doesn't have tea or hibiscus. Contrast to Ambre Sultan Serge Lutens: These are different, but the amber is similarly thick and resinous. AS has the standout bayleaf instead of tea & hibiscus. Contrast to Armaf Niche Oud: Another Amber Fougere, these have some similarities while they're still quite different. Similar thick and resinous amber but Armaf Niche Oud is spicier and lacks the tea-hibiscus combo.

It's an amber forward fragrance but not a gooey sticky amber (which I don't like). To my nose it's leaning masculine. It has a pleasant smell. Very well balanced.

I personally enjoy my other CN fragrances much more than this one, but it is a very safe, comforting, appealing fragrance for anyone to wear.

I get an opening mix of green tea and bergamot. The sandalwood, like it does in Homme EDP and Parfum, hits you almost immediately. The amber, patchouli and leather combine beautifully.  Definitely a unisex scent. I think it leans slightly more masculine, but that‚Äôs my DNA talking. I could see the Mrs pulling this off just as well.  Projection isn‚Äôt overly strong. Between moderate and strong. Longevity is bang on. 8-10 hours on 3-4 sprays. Any more and you‚Äôre overdoing it.

But, you know it's kind of spicy, kind of creamy, and kind of floral. The main stanout for me is the gorgeous, sleek amber.  I think this is very versatile and straight down-the-middle unisex. It will work on anyone. Even though I think it would work in most situations (even the office), Scent Intense makes me think of fancy things, like limousine rides and deluxe hotel suites. Love this stuff."", 'Absolutely beautiful! Green notes clash with spices, fall on an ambery bed. Spicy cinnamon teams up with soft woody sandalwood, and mix with a green accord of tea, bergamot, and sweet apple, all wrapped in an amber fossil. Spicy, lightly-sweet, lightly-woody, ambery, lightly-green. Scent Intense is difficult to describe. A lot of notes clash here but the cinnamon & amber standout, which are freshened up with green notes. This is a gorgeous cold weather wear. I can easily imagine how knee-weakening beautiful this would smell coming off a wool or cotton jacket on a cool evening.

I bought the new male release I(taly) , which appealed to me the most out of the male fragrances. Once home I was pleasantly surprised with Scent intense. Great floral fragrance which reminds me of the Tuberose based Jill Sander no.4, which I own myself. I bought that one after adving my wife to test it. She liked but as she said, not for her. So I bought it for me. Love the combination of animalic and soapy Tuberose. Scent Intense is supposed to have Jasimine instead of Tuberose, still I liked it a lot. Later I bought (Beastmaster) Pour Homme, by far the longest lasting frangrance of the 300 I own, and Soul.

If uniqueness is one of the facets to judge a fragrance then this one takes the prize. At first scent I find this fragrance to be very alluring, sort of like a wild orchid in the raw. The top notes are fleeting, the tea leaf note merges homogeneously with the florals representing the mid notes (Hibiscus and Jasmine, I don't for the life of me know what Davana is) and the dry down takes this fragrance to another level. An ambrosian mix of amber, patchouli and olibanum done right. This is one of the stand out scents in my collection solely due to its distinctiveness. All seasonal scent? No, better suited to fall and winter, but can be used for evening wear in spring time also Unisex? Its marketed for females, but better suited to men IMO Performance? Good, longevity of 8 hours and moderate projection. Blind buy worthy? I wouldn't think so, it might be amber heavy for some people and it is very different, so better to sample before.

Another example of that tried and true principle of not judging a book by its cover... The scent itself is hard to describe, because it\'s so smooth and well blended that it\'s hard to pick out any individual notes - although if pressed I\'d say I get amber (obviously), tea, cinnamon, leather and a hint of bergamot. It\'s a comfortably elegant scent, warm and sweet and perfect for winter, but rather subtly so, very harmonious. Unisex isn\'t a word I\'d use to describe it, but there\'s certainly nothing girly about it, and I believe the reviewer below me when he says it works for him.

Opening is ripe red fruits and abstract dusty spices which together form a red wine accord. The fruitiness stays and soon joins a smoky floral heart with unsweet amber. The mid transition slightly reminds me of CDG2 because they both seem to share a futuristic blade runner jam-like rose note. On paper instead, the heart reveals no rose, but has a very distinct citric black tea accord. Amber is somewhere there, but I have a hard time smelling it because it comes off as ultra dry and only vaguely sweet. Nearing drydown a camphorous balsamic sandalwood-leather combo seals the composition with a powdery finale. Sounds complex, but all this happens with minimal edges and overall the scent feels very linear. Many have mentioned a sweaty quality, but to my disappointment couldn‚Äôt find it‚Ä¶ maybe I‚Äôm anosmic. The scent seems to constantly disappear and reappear. Most of the time I can‚Äôt smell it whilst wearing yet occasionally I get a loud burst of dry powdery spices and vanishes to nothing in a millisecond. Also, I‚Äôm uncertain with whether this is long lasting or not. Like others have mentioned, Scent Intense does indeed feel quite unnatural and emotionally void, almost like an artificial intelligence was given the task to prepare a sexy oriental fragrance. However, Scent Intense isn‚Äôt as contemporary as it sounds. There is a certain powdery and balsamic ‚Äúsandalwood‚Äù base which I feel is also present in older frags like Lanvin Oxygene and Escada Magnetism Pour Homme, but not in the newer ones such as Santal 33 (which use another unfortunately disgusting synthetic). In other words, SI was hypermodern in the beginning of 21st century and very relevant still today, but one can feel it‚Äôs from an earlier era, which is not a bad thing by any means. Kind of like the movie Fifth Element which is surpassingly dated today yet we are still in love with Leeloos‚Äôs orange hair and suspenders. Not bad, but I think Scent Intense could‚Äôve been more. I recommend Lanvin Oxygene for a more out there, brighter and milky scent of the same structure.

The fume hits you in waves - sometimes it's a pleasant amber, sometimes it's a humid patchouli, and other times it's a dense smoked woodscent.

It drifts somewhere between masculine and femenine and it comes off as more of a beautiful/sexy scent on me - it is amazing if that's your thing!

This comes about 7 hours after the start and sits around doing the metallic humming that such bases often do. The top is a soft and translucent smoky tea + jasmine combo that blooms very nicely.

The perfume had start to smell! It smelled old lumber and wood combined with ""wood-oil"" like paraffin that you use upon wood. It reminded me a lot of my friends father, who is working in the woods with machines and lumber. It had the same dirty unclean forest smell with a hint of regular oil as well, just the way he smelles after a long day in the woods. NOT the way I want to smell. Very unik though, but pretty awful.

Scent Intense is strongly masculine in nature, it deliberately stays that way on my skin. My innate one-hundred-per-cent-pure-girl cannot compete. The handsome and alluring bouquet of male incites the aroma of closeness with the opposite sex even to my nose. At no stage during the evolution do I not smell like a proficiently sexy guy.

But instead got something a little crude, slippery and gently sour with a sweet undertone. Giving in to suggestion and stretching my imagination, I decided I thought I could smell sour hibiscus blossoms, but then it didn't seem floral at all. Amber? Maybe a salty accord created with botanic ingredients. At one point I also thought I caught a whiff of an old, dilapidated wood jetty infused with salty beach air, perhaps some agarwood (oud)--even then I was pushing way too hard for the reported notes to make sense. Directly to the brand's website I went. Amber and cystine are the notes mentioned. Cystine? Apparently a sulfurous amino acid found in human hair, skeletal and connective tissues and digestive enzymes. No wonder people here are smelling sex, sweat, flesh and devils. That in combination with a transformation into a gentle, sweet sandalwood and amber drydown actually makes for an incredibly magnetizing fragrance if you don't think too hard about the notes. And if you just embrace the effect--it might even turn you on. I think this fragrance also functions much like a mood ring, transformative and dependent on the aura you're projecting; very reactive to your unique chemistry.

Scent Intense, is not only an intensified version, but an entirely different composition altogether. I immediately detected the patchouli in the opening which had a rather dusty and leathery feel to it. Beneath the strong, almost masculine notes, a sweet, milky jasmine note rises from the darkness bringing with it an interesting coziness.  Although bold and dark, Scent Intense does have a rather feminine smoothness. Some are saying it smells a bit like incense and I somewhat agree. However I think it smells like an inclosed space with the scent of stale incense rather than the burning, smokey kind or the incense stick itself. Despite its rather gothic approach, I find this fragrance elegant, feminine and sophisticated. Perhaps even at times a little clean and powdery. While the patchouli and amber tend to dominate this fragrance, there is also a tar-like note blended with a 'raisin-y' tobacco note that only adds to the intrigue and the warmth. The sillage and lasting strength are highly commendable, however I wouldn't expect anything less. It seems to be that Scent Intense is quite a popular buy on the niche market which pleases me greatly. This fragrance is kind of geared towards women that want to smell a little bit different, steering clear of smelling like a bouquet of flowers or fruit juice."", ""As most of the fragrances from Chypre group, Scent Intense on me starts cold, with lovely patchouli dominating. Actually I've always thought that I dislike patchouli in perfume, but as it seems - I just didn't start with the best patchouli.  Soon the hibiscus appears together with tea note and start's to remind iced red tea, for me this ansamble is very enjoyable. This could be a perfect, sophisticated fragrance for hot summer nights when you just need something elegant, but cold enough. The scent itself is very feminine and classy. I love the part when jasmin starts to show it's face as then the fragrance becomes sweeter and even a bit smoky.  At the end of the heart phase the scent becomes a little bit warmer, I suspect from amber and sandalwood.

They assume I have been intimate before work: having to tear myself away from the passionate embrace of my hot metro-sexual lover. Often not the case sadly.  Scent Intense is strongly masculine in nature, it deliberately stays that way on my skin. My innate one-hundred-per-cent-pure-girl cannot compete. The handsome and alluring bouquet of male incites the aroma of closeness with the opposite sex even to my nose. At no stage during the evolution do I not smell like a proficiently sexy guy. This stuff is awesome!', 'Well, that was weird. On first sniff I would have sworn Scent Intense was a rose oud combo with added ""peculiar"". All good so far. :) A minute or so later I caught a whiff of... amber? Pressed my nose to my arm and was nearly choked by, yes, definitely amber. This was really getting interesting. I had to come here and look up the notes. What?! No rose? No oud? So, clearly amber then - and now that my brain knows what\'s in there, my nose has decided the tea and hibiscus must be responsible for the rose/oud note. After an hour I can make out the patchouli and jasmine. Whatever the notes, the overall effect is a hit with me. Resinous, warm, incensey, gentle, mysterious, weird in a good way. And I\'d say it\'s easily unisex.', ""One of the most alluring & seductive fragrances I have ever smelt. Scent Intense opens with an inviting, sensual aura of aromatic tea notes and a semi-sweet fruity-floral uplifting sensation that immediately pulls you into the land of fairy tales. Just like a double-faced temptress, it will envelop you in a seductive, passionate & mystical veil of euphoria.  While I remain intoxicated by this initial encounter, some secret ingredients led by thick amber cunningly start to surface, initiating the revelation of SI's hidden, dark, metallic yet warm, thick industrial smoky heart. Scent Intense is, in my mind, a fantastic display of contradictions, a simple yet utopian creation. Riveting. 9/10"", ""Perplexing at first. On spray, I was determined to smell amber, woods, maybe flowers and at least a hint of tea. But instead got something a little crude, slippery and gently sour with a sweet undertone. Giving in to suggestion and stretching my imagination, I decided I thought I could smell sour hibiscus blossoms, but then it didn't seem floral at all. Amber? Maybe a salty accord created with botanic ingredients. At one point I also thought I caught a whiff of an old, dilapidated wood jetty infused with salty beach air, perhaps some agarwood (oud)--even then I was pushing way too hard for the reported notes to make sense. Directly to the brand's website I went. Amber and cystine are the notes mentioned. Cystine? Apparently a sulfurous amino acid found in human hair, skeletal and connective tissues and digestive enzymes. No wonder people here are smelling sex, sweat, flesh and devils. That in combination with a transformation into a gentle, sweet sandalwood and amber drydown actually makes for an incredibly magnetizing fragrance if you don't think too hard about the notes. And if you just embrace the effect--it might even turn you on. I think this fragrance also functions much like a mood ring, transformative and dependent on the aura you're projecting; very reactive to your unique chemistry. Indeed an enigmatic skin scent in the truest sense."", 'I tried this one and thought that I would really enjoy it. The lady in the store described it as a very dark, woody kind of deep smell. Sonds intresting, right? Well, it wasnt. At least not on me. When I first sprayed it I was suprised how little it smelled. I almost didnt get anything at all. Very strange I thought since the name was ""intense"", I was thinking that my nose had a bad day and left it on to settle in. After when I arrived to my work about 30 min later, I smelled a very strange smell, a odd woody, oily old man smell. I suddenly realised that I was the one who smelled like old lumber. The perfume had start to smell! It smelled old lumber and wood combined with ""wood-oil"" like paraffin that you use upon wood. It reminded me a lot of my friends father, who is working in the woods with machines and lumber. It had the same dirty unclean forest smell with a hint of regular oil as well, just the way he smelles after a long day in the woods. NOT the way I want to smell. Very unik though, but pretty awful. Maybe it works better for the rest of you? I however, will never ever step anywhere near it again!', 'No amber. This is nasty like dirty socks. It just smells like a fruity musk on someone unwashed.', 'For me, this is a disappointment. It‚Äôs like a weak fruits of the forest infused tea with a little apple and cinnamon that‚Äôs gone cold.

I blind brought Tolu as I wonder the idea of bring Tolu as a main play for the fragrance. Upon first spray, this is modern interpretation of classic amber fragrance. Recently, I have sniffed Ambra by Santa Maria Novella. The gold label. And I kind of unlock the concoction of ""Citrus, Amber and Animalic Musk"" seems to be classic interpretation. of Genre. I believe it calls ""Amberine"" accord. Tolu, still using the traditional route of development, however in this work more like Amber - Floral. As when Tolu hitting Floral element in heart, it\'s giving the slight spice floral, Orchid. Soft pink hue orchid that dance on (not-so) dry amber fragrance. Tolu is well played fragrance. When orange blossom start to hit amber base. When Orchid show up and certain moment that you kind of feel soft resinous along with sweetness. There is a moment of mild syrup vanilla and powdery tonka. yeah, this is dry amber fragrance with strong floral support. I believe aging will help the amber ingredients to be slight prominent. I gotta wait a bit longer but as instant impression this is served already. TL;DR : Tolu is (no-so) dry amber fragrance with strong element of soft spicy floral (orchid). Scent dance in harmony, have few focal points to focus along the way, amber in new way. I like this one. Modern Grand-pa. ===== Extension 2 : January 26, 2025 I retest now and I think Tolu is slight leathery, actually it is kind of Rubbery. I think I just understand how Amber can go Leathery / Rubbery. I think OM Tolu / Guerlain Chamade (More floral) and Diptyque New Benjoin Boheme (More spice and Sweet Vanilla) Eau Nabati (More Green and Leathery) Shams Oud (Twine with Birch Tar and Nagamotha) are the kind of the same genre. the dry amber fragrance. Another quality that I think Tolu is great offer. Is how airy it is, it feels almost fleeting. It\'s lucent. And that Orange Blossom that build everything is really an highlight. That compliments the tale. This have slight Cashmeran feels to it. When I do side-by-side with my Vintage Chamade EDP from 2011. It slight touch and cover well with Balsam. Orange Blossom / Amber - it kind of gives impression of Cologne Blanche Dior too. It is story teller.  I do notice Cashmeran in later stage of fragrance. But in this, I like it. I think this why I feel it is modern. As now : I am so please with Tolu. It blends well and think from above, this is unisex slightly leans Femme I am surely a guy can rock this. I cannot truly evaluate Tolu as individual as I just starts digging this genre, will wait at see.', ""This is not for me--I find it heavy, dated, too oily/orange-ish, and masculine-leaning on my skin. In all fairness, I don't typically care for any of the floral notes listed (eg, orange blossom, sage, orchid, or lily of the valley).  If you're trying to decide on this one, sample first. It might be helpful to look at my collection--you'll see I do typically prefer femme-leaning scents, and I don't own a lot of heavy amber frags because I live in a hot climate. I'm also testing in Texas November. It's 80 degrees outside."", ""Ormonde Jayne fragrances are blended so beautifully it‚Äôs challenging to pick out any one note.

The rose and lily emerge after 20 minutes or so.  I wish my skin didn‚Äôt emphasize the powderiness so much; the other elements get lost. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve encountered this perfectly balanced natural forest tableau and someone drives right through it with a dump truck of powder. It‚Äôs all the more frustrating because it‚Äôs so fucking perfect on paper, another gorgeous elucidation of that softness-meets-toughness-and-they-both-win thing that Ormonde Jayne is so very good at. Okay, listen. I‚Äôm back. The middle gets powdery. Like, really powdery. As we discussed. But I‚Äôm back to tell you that you need to stick with it. I left for a run feeling pessimistic about this scent, and by the time I came back and smelled my wrist, holy shit: something vanilla-y had entered the conversation to counter the powder and I was left with the perfectly balanced fragrance I had seen when I squinted through the powdery haze in the middle.

But then gradually it becomes more complex floral and balsamic with bittersweet notes. Interesting! Follow me on IG: scent.guide', 'My very first impression without searching any info about this perfume: I have smelled it for the first time in niche store. I don\'t know much about this niche house, however, this creation is a brand\'s success, I believe. In my opinion, the blending of the formula is exquisite. It owns classical oriental core, but rebuilt, reconstructed - made slightly modern. This sort of ""core"" reminds me Chanel Egoiste EDT, Guerlain Shalimar EDP, FM Musc Ravageur EDP, YSL Opium Pour Homme EDT, or modern Clandestine Clara by Penhaligon\'s in some degree. This sort of amber quality, but not this typical rich, thick and animalic, that you can potenically find is 80-90s oriental French perfumes - this is slightly different.  First of all, it is quite complex and not a simple one to understand by using the nose, I had some troubles..  I think, that some Ambers in a blend with some selected Musks, Rose constituents and Cinnamon-Clove like raw materials (Cinnamalva, Cinnamyl Alcohol, Eugenol, Methyl Diantilis stuff like this) make this classic ""core"" I imagine subjectively. I can feel this glowing, ambery, \'cinnamon bark\' like smell, that doesn\'t feel vintage, but reminds me those vintage amber formulas in some degree. This fragrance as a formula owns its bright and fresh side, in my opinion. It has many aromatic nuances too. Very smooth, very elegant, quite natural smelling fragrance. In my opinion, perfumer made here some absolutely brilliant work. It feels, that naturals play really nicely in the formula, just a great synergy.  I guess that things like Linalool and Ethyl-Linalool combination, Evernyl, lots of Hedione are indispensable in the formula. It is an oriental amber centered fragrance, which is also bright, slightly floral and fresh in the same time.  Beautiful from the start to finish.  I wanted to say, that it seems to be more on the mens side, but I am changing my mind in the moment. It seems to be slightly easier to understand during its dry down. I pick up some powdery texture on the paper strip after view hours. It is unisex right in the middle. Modernized, classic olfactive profile.  Do I like it? I like classic perfumery of XX century and sort of modernized fragrances like this. I can link this perfume to my ""imagined"" class of modernized yet classic olfactive profiles. So, yes, I like it very much. Kind of suits my taste very well.  Very eloquent, complex, yet fresh and modern, oriental amber perfumery with herbaceous nuances. Quite artistic and cleverly blended. It can be used in multiple scenarios. Professional environment, special occasions like wedding or even dates with a nice elegant outfit to it. Rock this well.  I think, that Sartorial lovers will appreciate this.', 'Turns sour in the dry down. 5/10', ""in a dream, you are standing in front of swimming pool filled with silk scarves that have been doused in heavy floral 'amber.' dive in, you are immediately enveloped in the silken creaminess and overpowering luxe of mature woman perfume. you manage to breathe and only go deeper into fragrance. deeper yet but you are not sinking, instead it seems you are floating on wings of balsamic tolu. but then... you awaken lying on your pillow, sun streaming into the room, there by the bed is a redolent bouquet."", ""I liked this enough to buy a decant, but after wearing it a few times, I realized it wasn't for me. An elegant, resinous, powdery scent ... and just too austere. But if that sounds like your vibe, do check it out. It's a powerful and long-lasting fragrance; one or two sprays and you're set for the day. Also -- it shares recognizable DNA with Ormonde Jayne Woman, but I found that Woman got cloying after a while, and Tolu doesn't."", ""This has to be one of the classiest yet still accessible perfumes I've ever smelled. This smells like quiet luxury to me. It smells like someone with generational wealth, as opposed to nouveau riche. It is so well-constructed and smells high quality. It's present without being ostentatious. The opening reminds me of a more modern Sisley Eau du Soir, which I thought was really lovely but I didn't have the vibe to pull it off (I may revisit in another 10 years). But this takes the best parts of Eau du Soir and makes it more down to earth and cozy. It's spicy and balsamic. As it dries down, it almost becomes soapy but not in a bad way. It's like the most luxuriously fragrant soap I've ever smelled, mixed with spices and amber. Also becomes a little sweeter. This can be a casual fragrance for every day and it can be used for special occasions. I love Ormonde Jayne, they make truly special fragrances that are elegant but never snobby and make me feel truly put together even when I'm not!"", ""Gosh this is signature scent worthy. Sometimes you just know true love when you sniff it. This fragrance gets where it needs to be quite quickly and then stays there all day. It opens up a tad green and a tad zesty. Quickly it starts drying down very breefly might i add, into a very noticable and slightly cloying and indolic lily of the valey. Then it transforms, again very swiftly, into a more woody and creamy base. The tolubalsem hits and it smells like the most fancy sauna oil in the best way. I say oil because that's what it's texture feels like to me. even though it is a deep heavy scent, it is not cloying. It will never bother anyone. A soft sheer and balmy veil covers your skin and the balsems light up and create the most beautiful warm, golden scent bubble. This is the classiest cosy scent i have ever layed my nose upon."", 'Got this in my discovery set from their website and on first sniff I immediately thought that it was too strong and heady. I decided to give it time to develop just to see how it‚Äôd transition and it got a bit lighter but the scent profile was still thick. I can‚Äôt really pick apart specific notes since this is blended well but the scent in short just smells like old lady perfume. I could see my grandmother enjoying this or older aunts I know but for a man such as myself it‚Äôs not for me. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a bad scent but definitely not one I‚Äôd want to wear on myself. 5/10', ""This was a blind buy at an online discount store, based on reviews from (YouTube) fragheads whose tastes jibe with mine. My first wear had me somewhat concerned, though, reminiscent of the way Musc Ravageur put me off, back in 2004, when the much smaller fragcom was raving about it. MR and Tolu share an aspect that I would call a 'wan ghost' - I suspect tonka bean, one of two notes they share - while being somewhat spicy and potent at the same time. This odd juxtaposition grated on me, but was likely what kept me coming back for more at the same time. In addition to Musc Ravageur, Tolu reminds me of a fragrance that instantly wowed me, Le Lion by Chanel. They share olibanum, which has a dark smoky and leathery feel, providing a rambunctious yet solid base and an almost-but-not-quite punk-like aesthetic. In addition to the ghost of tonka, Tolu balances its dark base with a floral headiness, dominated by orange blossom, while the lily-of-the-valley and orchid sing in wispy tones throughout the composition. There is a hint of green that lingers, adding substance to the floral song. The whole composition is balanced in such a clever way, that it keeps you on your toes, maintaining its potency throughout the day, wrapping you in warm comfort."", 'This is so amazing!!! I can not believe how strong and long-lasting it is. You can spray one time on a paper and that room would fill with the fragrance. The aroma slowly would linger from room to room of all my house.

Like others have said, it is reminiscent of the big 80‚Äôs & 90‚Äôs scents. Alas, it‚Äôs one of those scents my skin gobbles up, as it doesn‚Äôt last more than a few hours on me. It is very nice while it lasts though.', 'What a beautiful unique amber fragrance. It was my first purchase from OJ and my first love. And I have fallen down the rabbit hole and now own many more OJ fragrances. I called Ormonde Jayne to ask if they would please make an extrait version of this beauty. And was told that I can order a 45% extrait strength of Tolu, it‚Äôs a very strong version. Yes it costs about $120 more but it is so worth it IF you love TOLU as much as I do. As for the comments that are claiming they can‚Äôt smell anything but baby powder or some other crap, you must have a fake. Because this perfume is a beautiful masterpiece. People keep trying to buy perfume from cheap sellers and stores known for selling fakes and then come on here and give a bad review. That‚Äôs completely unfair and if you think you can buy a $150 fragrance for $25 then don‚Äôt complain when you get a fake. There are factories in Russia and China that do nothing but make fake perfumes. Fake bottles and fake perfumes. It‚Äôs also possible that you were sold a used bottle that was stored badly and went very bad. Heat is a perfumes enemy and when will ppl finally realize that you CAN NOT store expensive perfume in your bathroom. Even your good makeup should not be stored in your bathroom.

All of those notes and nothing else comes through for the entire life of the scent.', 'Truly a multilayered and multifaceted scent experience. There is a soft, vintage charm that comes with Tolu. Like a lot of OJ offerings there‚Äôs ample balance. The orange blossom is gorgeous in this one. The lily-of-the-valley, juniper and clarysage lend green and aromatic touches keeping the resins from getting too heavy or cloying. The balsams have a balmy and oily feel. However, this perfume is composed so expertly that I also find there to be a powdered effect floating throughout it.  It‚Äôs zesty, herbal, aromatic yet balsamic, plush, sumptuous, golden simultaneously. Truly unisex, extremely comforting. Timeless and sophisticated amber. Gorgeous for spraying all over your favourite knitwear and nuzzling. Ormonde Jayne did it again, Geza is a genius. I look forward to exploring more from the house.', 'Gorgeous!

The perfume opens up orangy and sweetly herbal and has a rich texture. It is followed by a massive floral heart, Lilly-of-the-valley is markedly pronounced, and has a powdery feel. From there it follows a natural and relaxed amber dry down in the grand manner which feels effortless and aerial. Fans of ambers may find a great companion here, a nice green fresh floral amber scent. Especially recommended to the ones looking for a different direction in their ambers other than the vanilla, soft woods approach. However, the floral aspects are accented heavily and ambitious buyers should make sure this is on terms with their preferences in a perfume.  In sum, the overall feel is luxurious and classy and the House's unmistakable signature is present. A wonderful perfume."", ""When I first tested Tolu, I thought it was similar to JD Jeffery Dames Duality and I still think that. I wore both perfumes because I considered buying both. I like JD Jeffery Dames Duality but, in the end, I decided I could do w/out it. Tolu was a completely different story. As I kept wearing Tolu and testing Tolu her secrets began to unfold for me and I became entranced w/ her beauty. Tolu starts off deep green, like an enchanted forest. That smell comes from the juniper and the Tolu balsam which is prevalent from beginning to end in this hypnotizing perfume. It makes this perfume smell alive. What I like about Ormande Jayne perfumes that work well for me is they smell alive and deeply connected to nature while still remaining a true perfume. Tolu has a Watery fresh orange blossom that throws a cooling tone over a very warm and woody fragrance. It gives this deep perfume lightness and an airiness that can sometimes be lacking in heavy vintage style perfumes. Rose is very strong here and is a powdery vintage style rose. But what impresses me most about this gorgeous perfume is how calming, warm and comforting it is. It literally beckons you to wear it. It is glamorous but down to earth at the same time. It is one of those perfumes that keeps calling your name until you surrender to its charms. Warm, rich, powdery, green, floral, amber that is sensual, womanly, seductive and quite bewitching. I am glad I got around to testing Ormande Jayne perfumes. I found 2 so far that I want very much and will end up buying. Tolu and Woman. Not everything they make is a homerun but what I like about this brand is when they get it right, they create magic. Tolu is in one word Magic. Edit: I retested JD Jeffery Dame Duality and couldn't do w/out that one either.

It projects better than the Dune perfume extrait. Overall, I find the quality of Ormonde Jayne excellent! I think Tolu will work wonders on all genders who carry sophisticated and mysterious air around them. A fascinating scent üëç"", 'mesmerizing and intoxicating. It took me a while to get this scent. It does have the usual OJ DNA but is so special', ""Strange enough I also get a strong powdery nuance on my skin when trying Tolu. 'Powdery' isn't the best word to describe it, it is not like powder compact or dust, rather the air inside a milk-tea shop which uses soluble powder instead of actual milk and tea, intensely sweet and somewhat artificial.  I mainly get the aromatics and sweetness, minimal ambers, thus quite lacking depth. Not impressive on my skin."", 'A beautifully structured, sublimely balanced, brilliant take on the ""oriental"" genre. Tolu turns the genre on its head by using fresh, sharp green herbal notes as well as a tinge of fresh, watery flowers on top of the ambery, incensy, resinous base, rather than the typical sweet vanilla and warm spices. This creates a gorgeous and disarming interplay between warm and cool notes that has me unable to stop sniffing my arm. I see a couple of reviews calling it powdery, but I\'m not smelling powder at all. Though incense, to me, doesn\'t read as ""powder"", as apparently it does to others? (I consider scents like violet, iris, and some types of rose ""powdery""). This review is based off a few hours spent with a decant; Tolu\'s immediately going on my BUY list.', 'A structured and modern oriental beyond attempts to lean into images of feminine or masculine, a true in-between and on-its-own. Earthy and warm, Tolu can appear, depending on temperature and my mood, almost plush but not too sweet (no faux baroque or vertiginous flower secretions here to reinforce the reign of divas of whatever gender here), woody but never harsh (no armour of booze or desperate grapefruit bitterness to sound over softly beating hearts). A natural, clean, warm and sometimes happy balm, that is Peruvian tolu for me. I use also the stronger concentration (custom, more expensive - I couldn‚Äôt resist) that lets the base radiate into a bigger statement. However, there is a beautiful and naturalistic lily-of-the-valley layered into the warmth of woods and resins going on for while, which I love and miss in the higher concentration. For me, both versions masterpieces.', ""This smells just like the shampoo my grandma used in the 90s. Herbal Essences maybe? It wasn't anything fancy. I don't mean to suggest that this smells like an old lady, because it doesn't, but it does smell like the most generic drug store shampoo. Performance is very good though. People won't think you smell bad, but they'll probably assume you just showered."", 'salty buttery popcorn & caramel amber 3-4 sprays, Medium to strong projection  Lasts all day', ""Tolu is a really interesting scent. On my skin, there‚Äôs powdery incense, but also some very subtle florals. It's a little more bitter and green closer to the skin, but it's still warm and spicy and a little sweet. I don‚Äôt think I have tried anything similar. It smells quite different on clothing - it has a fresher opening that quickly introduces some sweetness. Although I really liked it at first, I decided after a few hours that it's far too powdery and mature for me. However, I definitely appreciate it and think it's worth sampling!"", ""A good balsamic product should be warm, sweet, and stable... these three qualities in one. The clever thing about tolu is the difference between the front and back tones. A balsamic piece that doesn't change from start to finish is boring. It can also cause greasy feeling. Tolu has a green top note, fougere/herbal notes of Clary Sage, juniper and orange blossom, giving a strong, fresh herbal impression and a good start. I'm serious, a little too prickly and not very comfortable. Speaking of florals, Tolu is advancing fast. The floral fragrance here is green and astringent. Lily of the valley, clean white flower; rose, soft and fragrant. Everyone is familiar with it, but the orchid, which I found today is a green and elegant floral fragrance. As the scent becomes more dry and pink and the base of the balsam is clearly visible, Tolu takes on a solid amber-hued coat, and the frankincense undercuts the smoky effect of the tonka bean. The texture is smooth and slightly sticky. The rose still runs with resin. The cooling balm is lively without being heavy. As always, actual wear is right. OJ understands the truth of business. Heavy Tolu balm is too hot, so make it fresh."", ""I am who must set limitations for myself: I am compulsive, can make snap decisions especially in the acquisition of a fragrance for an already overwhelming collection. Sometimes I need to draw the line, learn to be fastidious, discriminating in my expectations from a fragrance, which brings me to Ormond Jayne. I've sampled many, and they are quite lovely, well done, but I drew the line: if I am going to have one full bottle from this lauded London brand, what would it be? What struck me with the wow factor immediately and kept me transfixed? Tolu. This is the one. The opening is startlingly beautiful orange blossom and lily of the valley contrasted with the watery piquancy of juniper berry. It was like hearing the first few chords of a new song and you already get that ineffable shiver down your spine and hair raising on the nape of your neck. Wow, this magnificent, and you know the majesty of the eponymous resin is already evident, Myroxylon balsamum, the balsam of Tolu. Tolu has a way with florals that amplify their treble, their radiance, and enhance their spiced facets. Cinnamic in nature, it's as if Tolu emphasized the core of cinnamon's spirit in resin form; its components include cinnamic acid, benzyl cinnamate and vanillin. However, much like benzoin, the sweetness is without sugar, the spice isn't hot, and there is an animalic backbone and sexiness that flirts with the florals and make them all shine and blush. Winter is the season where this really blossoms with haunting, seductive beauty. One need not douse themselves, as this has a diffusive presence and only one spray can really enchant and persist‚Äîthe sparkle fades out so slowly that by the time it's gone, you feel grateful that it lasted as long as it had and leaves a trace, a skin scent as good as it gets. So, I am sure some will try to talk me into building an OJ repertoire, but it will take some convincing, as this one ticks all of the boxes for me."", 'Tolu is a wonderfully blended Amber first fragrance. It opens with a sage amber smell on me with rose creeping in during the mid and then the amber ramps up and some spiciness enters. A very nice fragrance and also for mature noses as well as wearers. This smells like classic old school perfumery and it‚Äôs wonderful.', 'Tolu feels like I‚Äôve been miniaturized and am in the crevice of mountain-sized Alpine Breasts down which a cinnamon-laced amber river runs into a Golden lake, with silver incense nearby on the wind. Cold and warm at once.  One of the fullest, roundest, most translucent ambers perfumes I have ever smelled. All the richness of Bal a Versailles but without edges, instead all smooth and of a piece. My sister is hyponosmic.

It isn‚Äôt for me, but it is clearly a quality fragrance. The standout on my skin was how moderate the juniper note was. Normally it would trend toward Pinesol (for me), but this one retained the smell of juniper if one had broken some of its needles and stepped away two feet - it comes through yet never overpowers any other note.', 'Geza Schoen is a fragrance wizard, and Tolu proves it. You think amber can\'t be part of an all-weather, signature fragrance? Wrong. Somehow, this fragrance is equal parts refreshing and heady. Every few minutes, for six hours or more, I catch a slightly different whiff of this on my skin. It\'s mercurial, evanescent, and delightful. At $150 per 50 mL it is not a ""cheapie,"" but I\'ve smelled fragrances priced twice as high that aren\'t as well balanced or delightful to my nose. A must-try for anyone who enjoys fine parfumerie, especially ambers.', 'Reminded me of Shalimar Parfum Initial and Oriental Lounge from The Different Company. A very compelling and sophisticated elegance. Oozes class and attractiveness.', 'What a great frag. It‚Äôs deep, classy, soft, warm, feminine and elegant. It‚Äôs versatile IMO, you can wear this in the summer (I think). It‚Äôs not heavy or something. This can be a signature scent easy.', 'Thanks to a wonderful person who sold me her Chergui and sent a sample of Tolu to go with it, I was introduced to what I think is one of the most wonderful fragrances under the Sun. Tolu is amazing. It‚Äôs warm, comforting, sensual, and extremely of a high quality. This is a third fragrance in my collection along with Chanel #5 and JM Myrrh and Tonka that I can actually tell the difference in the way things are blended together. I‚Äôm in heaven wearing this masterpiece and don‚Äôt want to ever be without it.', ""Very powdery. Smells like older cosmetics, makeup powders. Once I got past that, amber and citrus made themselves known. I'm sensitive to powdery notes, as they are my least favorite. To me, this smells primarily powdery, then amber second. I knew at first whiff that this was a no for me."", ""Tolu, oh my Tolu.  For me this is perfection. This scent is addictive! I got myself a big bottle recently - for an important b-day - after having waited a number of years since our first encounter. All Ormonde Jaynes are phenomenal creations, but are darn expensive.  This is a unique fragrance and a must try for the ones that, like me, love amber based, oriental, sensual frags in general.  It is sensual and very elegant, it never screams but it whispers. It's class, refinement, mistery, elegance. It is genderless in my opinion.  Starts off fresh and crisp with some bergamot/neroli/lotv, then goes balsamic on the juniper note, and mantains this freshness and transparency all the way through. It becomes powdery soon (amber, the resins) but still has a distinct note of exotic land, and this fresh, balsamic note. You cannot tell the flower notes distinctly, although you guess there is some powdery rose in it.  The drydown is the best part, you can feel all the creaminess of the tonka and the tolu resin. Good longevity and moderate sillage (all elegant frags have, they never scream).  A gorgeous one."", 'Smells like very heavy floral soap bar. If you told me this has 2-3 flowers and nothing else in formulation it would sound right.', 'Starts off wonderfully citrusy and herbal, the freshness reminding me off Miss Dior Originale. As it dries down Tolu completely retreats to the skin. There is something sweet and a little bit burnt coming through.  It could have been love based on the topnotes but the drydown is a disappointment.', ""Gorgeous, sophisticated, silky amber in the Ormonde Jayne style. Beautiful orange blossom accord in the beginning. I love this house and this is one of my very favorites. I can't imagine anyone not at least liking this fragrance. Sillage is softly radiant as most from this house. Longevity is 6-8 hours. I understand why some refer to Ormonde Jayne as the English Chanel. The fragrances tend to have that seamless, symphonic coherence. Iso e super replaces aldehydes to provide that lift and sparkle."", ""What a fantastic perfume...blew me away from the first second! It feels like I'm in the jungle at night and I'm watching a tribal queen having just been coronated during a ritual around a bonfire. She's wearing a crown made from flowers, feathers and the bones of her enemies. The scent is a mixture of wild green foliage, freshly scrubbed skin and white jungle blooms. I'm getting all of that just from a perfume? Hell yeah! This scent awakens my senses and energises my imagination. Great stuff."", 'Very pleasant and overall mild scent, with some depth and originality. It reminds me of a high end and very pleasantly smelling ski sunscreen. Like most Ormonde Jayne scents, it is not beast mode for projection but does have a nice longevity.', 'Opens soapy and gains a rosy-spiciness in the mid. The base gets rather boring to me though, as it seems to lose the intoxicating depth it had previously.', 'Beautiful exotic oriental perfume. This one feels luxurious and has great scent trail. In my mind I associate this one to an exotic spa or a palace with resins and flowers scenting the air. Would use this only during the cold weather as it is a potent oriental elixir. Very comforting and feels smoother that traditional amber perfumes. The herbs and flowers balance the sweetness and this never becomes too overpovering. Smell of high quality ingredients.', 'Linda Pilkington gloryfied tolu balsam in this creation. I have been searching for resinous notes in fragrances and I came across this perfectly balanced fragrance by OJ. The appraisal of tolu is eminent in this creation, because it is so well blended with perfect notes to complete the craftmanshio of creating a perfect fragrance. The deep mellow dark character, that keeps lingering and changing its images over the hours as it develops on the skin and mingles with the body chemistry. Absolutely georgeous. Congratulations OJ.', 'Delicate and well balanced ambery Oriental. The perfume opens on a brief herbal note with sage, juniper and orange blossom. The floral heart is also brief and has rose, lily of the valley and orchid. The perfume settles soon into the dense base of tolu balsam and amber surrounded by tonka bean and slight olibanum. Unisex slight feminine leaning with moderate to strong sillage and good longevity. Very nice but not particularly novel by any means. Enjoy!', 'nothing is strange here, nor ""niche"" taste, this one is mainstream likeable perfume. The biggest compliment gatherer in my collection. It is very feminine and floral (stands out during warmer months) and balsamic, and everything there is perfectly blended. It behaves perfectly well in warm weather as in the cold weather, longevity is top notch. I dont want to go into notes deconstruction because this makes no sense when we talk about mainstream likeability of niche beauty :) try to find a person that does not like it!', 'This is my first time sampling tolu, a specific kind of resin, so I‚Äôm not clear about what I‚Äôm actually smelling. Tolu is described as a woody oriental. To my uneducated nose I‚Äôm picking up an interesting amber composition, sweetened by tonka, sitting on a floral base. Orange blossom is here but very light, same with rose but it‚Äôs also a touch smoky, creating a drydown that is smoky floral. Another reviewer describes Tolu as strange, I agree, and think that‚Äôs why this one is particularly hard to describe. But it‚Äôs strange in a good way, I keep sniffing my arm trying to come up with adjectives. I just know that I love it. Feels very natural, soft and elusive.', ""I have been trying to wrap my head around this frag in order to write a review for the past couple of weeks now and every time I think I have got a handle on it, it shows me another facet. Tolu is one of those frags that is deceptively simple at first but as you live with it for a while, it starts of show off different layers. It is one of those frags you need to invest a relationship in before you truly appreciate it. Geza Schoen has produced a gem here. The top notes of Tolu are very bright citrus and a spicy, green, herbal note. It reminds me of the opening of Nicolai New York Intense actually even though that is mostly Bergamot with pepper n cloves and I dont find any corresponding notes here. But oh well, just know it smells immediately captivating. The heart phase here is pretty muted, the floral notes mentioned are mostly minor facets adorning the glorious Tolu Balsam note. For once, a Perfume has been aptly named as the balsamic amber note here is the central deity here around which the others notes offer obeisance. The tolu balsam is adorned with tonka to give it a sweet edge and the ambery frankincense to give it the familiar rich amber note. All in all, truly a work of art by a Master Perfumer. Projection is nice and strong for about 3-4 hours and longevity is a solid 8 hours on my skin. I get a full work day out of it easy.  In conclusion I would say None of these notes used in Tolu are things you have not smelled a thousand times before but they have been brought together here with a fresh flourish and aplomb that is truly something to behold. If you are an Amber lover of any sort, you owe it to yourself to get your nose on this. The simplest way I can describe this frag would be Nicolai New York Intense meets Tom Ford Amber Absolute. That is not really doing it justice but should give you an idea. I love this one and it's definitely become one of my all time favourites. 9.5/10"", ""A great scent to wear in chilly weather. Very warm and of course resinous. The tolu is strong in this one. It is a tad sweet but it is all perfectly balanced. After a while you detect the orchid, neroli and aromatics which prevent this becoming too heavy. They cut through the resins and define the fragrance and are more evident with time. Can you tell it's a winner with me yet? There is something about it that reminds me of cartier baiser du dragon but this is more interesting. I fear reformulation took away the fire in Cartiers dragons kiss. So sad. Further down the timeline and there is a soapiness which I don't mind for a change. I get good longevity and good sillage in this 20 degree room. I also think a fella could easily carry this one off. It is borderline unisex."", ""Tolu is one of the most comforting perfume that I have ever tried so far. Tolu is an oriental creation which follows big orientals like Youth Dew, Opium and expecially Shalimar but with more modern way. I find it airy, easy to wear, chic and warm. I'm always getting amazing comliments from people when I wear Tolu. It makes me happy. Amazing job!"", ""After a slightly acrid herbal-woody opening (sage?), Ormond Jayne's Tolu turns into a warm amber, orange blossom, balsam and wood scent. It's mostly an amber scent on me - sweet, only a little powdery, and a glowing golden brown. After the opening, it's a pleasant experience all around. Very cozy in fall and winter. The tolu and orange blossom keep this scent from being just another amber scent. Lovely, radiating projecion (not too strong, but sort of wafts out in waves in a natural way), medium longevity. Like."", ""Excellent review by JTD below. I agree with most that is said and do not have much to add. It is a rather soft and resinous oriental. Somewhat floral but not much. Beautiful and long lasting. It is true that it reminds us of older oriental fragrances, but it does not feel dated at all. And it does not remind me of granny's fragrances.  It may lean a bit feminine, though not really. The floral aspect is soft and the resinous part dominates. I would say unisex."", ""As an oriental and especially floral oriental lover, I've tried for years to love Tolu. I do like it, but it has a sharpness that puts me off. I don't get any floral notes from it at all; if I did, it would probably smell more rounded and plush and thus more pleasant to me. As it is, it is just never quite what I want it to be. I'm going to continue experimenting with layering it in hopes of using up all the versions in which I bought it (I've tried the EDP, parfum, bath oil, and body lotion)."", ""Tolu is one of perfumer Geza Schoen's early perfumes and one of the perfumes that launched the Ormonde Jayne line in 2002. It's an interesting spin on the oriental genre and provides a glimpse of the techniques and style that would become Schoen's signature. It also demonstrates how a 'contemporary' style ages. Contemporary independent perfumers have riffed on the oriental perfume since the niche trend started. Just as Christopher Sheldrake did with the Bois series for Serge Lutens, Schoen based Tolu on a close reading of the traditional model. Both perfumers deciphered it, focussing not just on the compositional 'recipe' but the logic behind it---the how and the why. Sheldrake's Bois perfumes were famous/infamous for their optimistic use of woody amber materials, and in this respect there is a lot of common ground in Sheldrake's and Schoen's methodologies. Where they differ is in their relationships to archetypal oriental perfumes. Sheldrake bent what he found into a distinctly new shape. Shoen also took the genre down to the studs but came up with a different model for innovation: facsimile. Tolu is a clever rebuild of the traditional oriental perfume. In terms of scent Tolu and Guerlain Shalimar run on close parallel paths but they diverge sharply when it comes to texture. Tolu's stained glass luminescence has all of Shalimar's richness but none of the opacity and graininess that makes it seem dated to the modern nose. Schoen recreates Shalimar's citrus accord with an evergreen/herbal mix. It has a whiff of turpentine, whose citric/lime facet replicates Shalimar's bergamot topnote. The aromatic herbal accord lasts well into drydown, making it an ingenious proxy for Shalimar's famously hefty dose of Guerlinade. As the name implies Tolu's resinous core stems from tolu balsam, which gives the perfume an unwrinkled matte appearance. Tolu's heart is significantly less sweet than Shalimar's but the vanilla is just as pronounced and tolu balsam's hint of cinnamon accents vanilla's woodiness. Leather is as prominent as it is in the Guerlain but without the smoky backdrop of birch tar it is sheerer and decidedly more modern.\xa0Shoen gave his perfume a sizable orange blossom note, which differs from the Guerlain's jasmine and rose heart, but adds noticeably to the perfume's suntanned glow. Tolu's innovative reimagining of an historical genre with contemporary materials made it novel when it was released in 2002 but the particular style of luminosity does date it. It scores exceedingly high on 'radiance' which pegs it as a Millennial Perfume, a cohort of fragrances composed with famously high percentages of insistent woody-amber materials. To Schoen's great credit, Tolu has aged more gracefully than most perfumes of the early '00s. It reads as era-specific rather than outdated. Trend might have followed Shoen, but he lead through innovation. Part of the charm and appeal of oriental perfumes has always been their over-the-topness. To the modern nose, though, they might be a little much for daily wear, like opera or high drag. For those who do favor the Emeraudes, Tabus and Youth Dews of the world Tolu's light version of a dense style might seem inauthentic, like a spray tan or a faked orgasm. But for those who find traditional perfumes a bit too heavily brocaded Tolu offers an oriental without melodrama. (from scenthurdle.com)"", 'Free sample..my take: Feminine on initial spray, a flowery-balsamic combo, light-moderate sillage. On dry down it becomes more balsamic, Longevity is great, 8 hours easily. I like it although not enough to buy a bottle. A bit too feminine and generic balsamic for me.', '""For women and men"" is often applied to niche, but that\'s really a stretch with this one to my nose. Why? Tolu takes me back to something my grandma used to wear. Something by a designer brand that she would save for church or other special occasions. Something by Estee Lauder? YSL? Not sure. I do get most of the notes that are listed or otherwise commented on here.  I\'d buy this as a gift for a special lady. My personal frame of reference for this kind of scent is forever etched in my mind as being ""feminine."" But I\'m grateful for the sample, which was like an after scent of a Grandma hug on one of those special occasions.', 'This is very nice. Soft, feminine oriental,balsamic. Mature but not dated. Moderate sillage and longevity. But..this reminds me so much of Youth Dew! not as rich and strong as YD,imagine that you put 2 drops of YD in a cup of water, then you have Tolu by OJ! Why to spend so much money for a super diluted youth dew when you can have the real deal for just $30?', ""I'm really impressed by this fragrance. The first smell I get is oddly the base notes - rich and powerful amber and resins. But then only seconds later, the top notes appear as you would expect. Beautiful orange blossom and juniper make for a fresh contrast to the heavy resins and amber. The middle notes are gorgeous. Completely unisex florals. I usually don't like Lily of the Valley in fragrances, but this one gets it right. Mixed with rose, it is a really clean, refreshing floral vibe. As a guy wearing this, I think of some old school Guerlain scents (Habit Rouge in particular). The base is as expected, deep, resinous, and satisfying. This is a unique fragrance and I look forward to repeated wearings to see what else I pick up."", 'It almost reminds me of Shalimar!', 'This just smells like orange or citrus and is not very strong with no projection.', 'This made me aware of how much I dislike orchid note in perfumes.  In this particular case I clearly detected the irritating note as a dull smell of some everyday hairproduct (shampoo, hair spray) appearing out of nowhere in the middle of what could otherwise be very smooth and sophisticated oriental. A single disonante turned Tolu to less niche, more mainstream-smelling creation. And there\'s a whole bunch of ""fresh flowers"" listed for a woody-oriental I must notice.. Also agree with the statement below - the opening is actually the best part of the composition. To me, it came close to being some sort of more transparent Cuir Ottoman; more clear - without the thick iris fog, more fragile - without the heavy sillage. ONLY IF without orchid.', 'A very cozy warm, very aromatic fragrance. Well not surprisingly this is very heavy on the tolu and sweetened a touch by the strong supporting acts of the tonka and the amber. Its not long before the olibanum and orchid are very evident. Its the olibanum note that ruins it for me. The juniper, sage and the neroli work well to act like accents to what its after all a fragrance with a lot of ""heavy"" base notes. Perfect for cool and cold weather wear. Only moderate sillage and longevity which is surprising considering the notes in this. No fb for me Im afraid.', ""Tolu is one of the best winter perfume i have ever seen. People always ask me how good i'm smell when i wear this. Warm, cozy, creamy and bright. Best one in the collection!"", 'TOLU is a beautiful, pillowy-cuddly-marshmellow amber dusted with resinous powdered sugar. The overall character of TOLU is soft yet persistent. It really reminds me of beautiful vintage scented face powders and creams. From distance it smells like a classic oriental with a very sheer, smooth, chiffon-like blend of amber, benzoin and a sightly smoked white chocolate aroma. The closer you get to the skin, the sweeter and creamy it becomes. A big creamy powder puff. It is sweet, but not in a gourmand way. It is powdery, but not in a outdated manner. Consistent with other ORMONDE JAYNE perfumes, TOLU is rather linear with very good sillage. TOLU exudes femininity. It is classic yet still elegant. Like a confident woman who is not afraid of aging and takes absolute pride in her wisdom and experience.', 'It smells quite great on the paper strip I tested this on, but Esteban Tolu is a good bit better, I think.', ""I love balsamic orientals, and I wanted this one so badly that I almost went ahead and blind bought it. I am *so* happy that I got a decant first. Colin Maillard's previous review describes this perfume very well. To me, it's very basic, boring and underwhelming. Rochas Absolu or the modern version of Opium - which I would not pay money for - do what Ormonde Jayne Tolu does for much less money and they last a great deal longer. I can think of so many balsamic orientals that equal or surpass this, it's hard to believe. The radiance is low, the sillage is modest, longevity moderate or less. It spends the majority of it's time being an ordinary sort of amber fragrance that you won't notice without putting your wrist to your nose. It's not bad, but it's so far from great. Polite, inoffensive, nice. 6.5/10 being generous. I'm so disappointed."", 'Not as exotic or unique as I was hoping. Smells exactly like Rochas Absolu, which can be had for a fraction of the price.', ""I couldn't wear Tolu when I first received the OJ Discovery Set. At the time, my body chemistry went to war with anything resinous. So glad that got sorted, because now it works on me, and it is absolutely gorgeous! While I love the peppery openings of many of the OJ scents, this one starts out much differently. There is an initial wave of orange blossom and sage, but still with a resinous underpinning. On me, the floral mid notes emerge quickly, predominantly a hint of rose and orchid. I never have the sense, though, that this is a floral perfume. The delicate spice and warm tolu keep their presence known throughout. It is sophisticated--a new classic for the 21st century. This scent is for the woman who wants to reach beyond gourmands and white florals into something that is complex, spicy, resinous, and a hint woody, while still being utterly feminine. Saving my pennies so I can spring for a bottle or travel set."", 'Three words on my mind: grown, classy, feminine.', ""This review is based on a tiny decant. On my skin and to my nose, I get mostly tolu, tonka bean and orchid with a hint of vanilla. Maybe there's a little bit of frankincense in the background too. Amber joins in later with a slight boozy undertone. Moderate projection and good longevity on my skin. I feel projection could be better if I apply more. All in all, it feels classic (not dated) and contemporary at the same time. I've not smelled anything like it before. It's quite unique in my books."", 'This started off warm, round, and acceptably spicy...then morphed into a sharp powder reminiscent of 1980s scented toilet paper. Grrr!', ""Very deep,thick and sweet. I really don't deyect any of the floral notes which is a good thing. Amber,tonka,oilbanium and tolu balsam give it a deep and resinous vibe. Very unisex and appealing. It goes on heavy and sillage remains great for about 5-6 hours on me. After that it settles down to a bit of a powdery feel. No complaints from me as this is a love at first sniff."", ""Oh how long I have waited to try this and today, the wait is over! Just as I dreamt of it being, just as I imagined the delightful tolu to be, a stunning masterpiece! I was hit with some citrus balsamic notes with the initial spay, I waited anxiously for the scent to develop as I knew there was much more to come, and how right I was. The more it develops, the more sweeter, more feminine it becomes. The amber comes out to play, giving it depth and warmth, at the same time the citrus is still present. I can definitely detect some orange blossom, this is making the sweetness more prominent. Once it settles, it turns into a powdery wonder, just enough powder to blend in with the spices, woods and flowers. An extremely elegant, romantic and sexy scent, very sensual too. The downside is it doesn't last on me at all, otherwise it would have been absolutely perfect! If I had to describe how this scent makes me feel when I am wearing it, I would say 'Like a girl in love, plucking out flower petals and saying he loves me, he loves me not'"", 'Yes, this is the best fragrance by Ormonde Jayne. Beautifully sensual, opulent, seductive, magnificent. It may remember Feminite du Bois by Serge Lutens, but Tolu is more powerful. Orchid and amber: two ingredients complacent and expressive.

One funny thing is happening on my arm: Shalimar at the wrist and PS at the elbow...?"", ""Not exactly my style but I can appreciate this fragrance for what it is. It's my first meeting with Tolu Balsam in such high quantities and what I'm getting is major golden amber tones, slight masculine vibe. It feels kind of regal, and makes me think of ancient times. Just the right amount of spice. It's a very full bodied fragrance and wafts beautifully in subtle but not weak waves. It feels very smoothly blended and somehow feels familiar, like a hug from someone I used to know. It's deeply resinous, rich and warm, quite comforting also. It feels quite classic to me. It's also the strongest Ormonde Jayne I've tried to date I'm not sure I'd buy it but, glad I'm using my sample today. It's quite warming and bringing a bit of golden sun to this gloomy day in London."", ""This is so uniquely beautiful. I know coffee isn't listed as a note but does anybody else get it as well?

That note seems to stay from the moment I put it on to the moment it's wearing off and I lurrrrve it ‚ô•  Aside from the caffeine addict in me loving this - that orchid is just LUSCIOUS. The Spices, Amber and Vanilla (only a hint of Vanilla on me) compliment the Coffee and the Orchid beyond belief. I am *crazy* about this.

The top notes include sage which is invigorating and therapeutic. The dry down is tonka bean, sandalwood, ambery heaven. A real wrist sniffer. Sillage is fantastic, it will draw many admiring compliments. This is for a woman of any age who holds eloquent taste. The bottle also looks gorgeous on one's mantlepiece.

I suspect that layering Tolu with something dark could produce a truly fabulous blend."", ""I made the review below, just timed out from my account.  At first spray I was greeted with a sharp juniper berries & orange blossom. It's good, really. The sage was just behind, adding some green kick. This is also smoky & kinda metallic. But oh so amazing top. No powdery scent here. I have high hopes with this beginning but I already felt this can lean more for men. Then 5 minutes after, a flower manifested, the ros√©, so beautiful, blending well with the juniper berries & sage. The orange blossom was hiding now. I also detect a wonderful scent, a balmy tone, woody, could it be the tolu? If this is tolu, then its blends with the other notes are remarkable. No powdery scent, again. If tolu is a compelling note especially when mixed with ros√©, florals & greens, then oud may have a competition in perfumery. At this stage the coin has turned, leaning to feminine side. But without the florals, this woody tolu note could be a hit for men's fragrances.  15 minutes after application, this composition has come out with stings of smokiness & sweetness of tonka with little support from ros√© & tolu. The base is good but the dominance of smoke & tonka prevented the rose & woods to be more noticeable. If only the ros√© & tolu gets a stronger emphasis & lesser on the tonka and smoke that acted like an incense. Again, it leaned back to masculine scent. The balmy vibe diminishes, no powdery scent detected throughout my brief journey with Ormonde's Tolu. I love this scent from top to heart but the base is not unique. I have smelled a better base, better & intriguing than this, it is the wonder of Amouage Opus VI."", ""Try taking your nose away from your wrist with this one~It's practically impossible. The orange blossom and tolu come together in this staggering, smoky, golden nectar of a scent.Tolu's depth is unmistakeable and it's quality breathtaking. Juniper, and sage add an herbal edge while the florals create a haunting richness. They play off of each other almost like the facets of a diamond play with light. They draw you deeper into the inhale and as you sit there smiling like an idiot~the base notes come up at you and play your heart like a resined bow over a string...this perfume is all about closer. You MUST get closer......although it has excellent sillage and longevity....you will still come....closer:)"", 'Love, love, love this! Gorgeous smoky swirling notes of resin mixed with creamy Amber and sweet Tonka they move around me while Rose, Lily of the Valley, Orchid and Orange Blossom softly anchor the perfume to a floral base. A tenacious and soft beauty brilliantly constructed in moving 3D.  Day or night, light or heavy application this is just perfect for any occasion.  10/10 well worth the money OJ!!', ""I love this! I think I will have to break down and have a FB. It would definitly be a GO TO scent for me! I'd be wearing it a lot!"", ""Tolu is impressive. Resinous, spicy, fruity and brimming with seduction. Upon application my nose recognises some similarities with Must by Cartier. The top of Tolu is slightly greener reminding me of Nu EDP also momentarily. The exquisitely crafted rosy notes are Tolu's defining feature. As the proud owner of both Must and Nu I will not be NEEDING the magnificent Tolu. Do I WANT it? Absolutely."", 'Love at first sniff, this starts out with a gorgeous medley of citrus and orange blossom, woods, vanilla, powdery tonka, and a floral note up front that smells something like ylang-ylang. I suppose it contains tolu balsam, which has a resinous, vanilla-like scent, and is usually used as a fixative, not the main attraction. Here it serves the usual purpose, with the main attraction being the florals and amber base.  Once the scent stabilizes, I would characterize Tolu as a beautiful, sexy oriental fragrance with a lot of citrus, and just enough rough edges to make it unusual. It‚Äôs as if there were angles that don‚Äôt quite mesh together, but the mismatch ends up creating an interesting texture. After a while there appears a sweet, creamy note that reminds me of rice pudding. I love the juxtaposition of this soft, smooth stream with the rough one. There‚Äôs just the right amount of sillage, and longevity is excellent, 8 hours or more. Two thumbs up on this one!', ""Something in this scent reminds me of all the good things about Shalimar, without the things that make it seem fussy or dated to so many people. I think it is the tonka bean and amber that draws that reaction for me, but this is so modern and fresh in comparison (even though I honestly love the original Shalimar). As with so many of Linda Pilkington's fragrances, the dry down on this is spectacular and I find I'm constantly sniffing myself throughout the day to enjoy more of this fragrance. Great but inoffensive sillage and long wear time. This is the perfect fall fragrance, but I find myself pulling it out on hot summer nights when I really want some sizzle."", 'FRESH WOODY SWEET THATS WHAT I THINK SAGE ORRIS AND TONKA IS NOTES THAT I SMELL SUPRISENGLY THE TOP NOTES ARE FRESH THEN THE VANILLA SHINES IN THE MID THEN IITS START SMELL MORE POWDERY AND AFTER A COUPLE OF HOUERS WHAT U WILL GET IS AN AMAZING AND SOFT AMBER THAT MIXED WITH RUM OR TONKA I DONT SMEEL ORCHID IN THERE AT ALL BUT MAYBE THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY NOSE OK LETS RETURNE TO THE MAINE SUBJECT TOLU IS VERY EASY TO LUV SPEICALEY FOR THE LAIDES ITS VERY SEXY PERFUME AND SECONDE /IF SOMEONE WANT TO UPGRADE FROM BRONZE GODDESS WICH IS CREMY COCONUTE MIXED WITH JASMINE THEN LAIDES THATS THE BIG DEAL THATS WHAT U LOOKING FOR OK PEACE', ""I find the primary character of the top notes fleeting, but then the beautiful bright nuance of the opening manages to glow all the way through Tolu. As the heart of this fragrance starts to beat, a bouquet of flowers begins to blossom--velvety, smooth, lush, rich--their botanical aroma doesn't seek attention, yet their ethereal beauty hovers. The resins in this composition are featured with most prominent perfection. Frankincense, for me has a penetrating quality on a very primal level--balsamic, rich, a little sharp, teasing awake some deeply buried corners of my psyche. Tolu balsam married with amber offers some comfy, malted goodness, like a fresh-from-the-oven earthy graham cracker dipped in warm, full cream milk. A very regal presentation of what culminates into a creamy, smoky, earthy, woody, sultry delight. Just try not to love this--about as impossible as sneezing with your eyes wide open."", ""I treated myself to the Ormonde Jayne Discovery pack and Tolu and Orris Noir are my favourites. Warm, sensuous and earthy fragrances are my new obsession. I find that they go the distance too. Can spray on early morning and get a compliment in the evening. Tolu is a fragrance that simply cannot be ignored. It's gorgeous and now my signature scent."", ""I've tried every single Ormonde fragrance, and hands down Tolu is my favorite. I can wear it day and night as it is both rich and light, or luxurious and energetic at the same time. It is very interesting but not in an obnoxious or pretentious way, just classy, unique, and brilliant."", 'This is a beautifully subtle perfume. Yes, it has depth and warmth, but it does not sit heavily. Woody and resinous spices, and the smoke of incense curl through it. But the lightness of the orange blossom, and the spark of the sage balance the richness quite perfectly right from the beginning. It manages to be of the earth and the air simultaneously. The drydown is gently warm and rich, with glints of the florals continuing to lighten and animate it. It remains three dimensional until the end, not powdery flat.  This is the first Ormonde Jayne I have tried and it is quite lovely in a thoughtful way.', ""After my abortive attempt to uncover the essence of osmanthus through a series of, let us say, disappointing fragrances, I was feeling pretty perfume deprived and so reached for something sure to fill the elixir void, the dark and viscous TOLU by Ormonde Jayne. I love tolu balsam and this composition is gorgeous, with that note definitely as focus. The florals are pretty much drowned out by the oriental components, above all, the tolu, but I'm not complaining as we have here an admirable example of truth in advertising.  Upon application, TOLU reminded me immediately of Rochas ABSOLU, which also features tolu balsam, but the difference is that this creation does not bear Jacques Cavallier's signature. I've said it before, and I'm sure I'll say it again: JC adds something to all of his perfumes to identify them as his own. Go down the list: TROUBLE, TRUTH, SO ELIXIR, VANILLE NOIRE, ABSOLU, SALVATORE FERRAGAMO POUR FEMME, NU...they all smell like Jacques Cavalier. I kid you not. If I acquire any more of his perfumes I'm going to have to write to ask him to start paying part of my rent, since the evidence is beyond dispute: he's clearly inhabiting my space! Anyway, I prefer TOLU to ABSOLU, all things considered, and recommend this delightful wintertime perfume to all who appreciate ABSOLU, BAISER DU DRAGON, MUST, and the like. Very, very nice."", ""I'm so grateful to Anorton1965 for sharing a sample of this with me! Tolu is such an amazing fragrance: it starts spicy, almost like carnation, but quickly dries down to a gorgeous woody/incense scent. One of the best resinous fragrances I've ever tried. My nose is not too good at distinguishing all the flowers in here. It's cozy and never sharp, seems like it has a hint of cocoa, but not exactly (tolu balsam?), it seems that frankincense adds smokiness, and tonka gives a touch of sweetness. It's a heavy scent but never cloying, absolutely perfect."", ""It's the only OJ I know and I have to say: It's gorgeous!  The scent is not all that flowers that are in the notes-the base is the strongest part from the get go.  the top and middle just make a floaty appearence but only shyly in the background. Amber, incence and surely tolu(though I don't know what it should smell like) + orange flower/ orchid with a hint of juniper I think, is most prominent. but it isn't too strong - the sillage and longvity is good, but it isn't too intense! Now I feel I've the same problem as with SCENT by CN: hard to get, expensive-and of course I want them! I feel like a dork because my right wrist seems to be glued under my nose-just can't stop sniffing TOLU! Everyone who has the chance please try to enjoy this dreamy one!"", ""This reminds me a little of mon parfum by paloma p on my skin-which is actually a good thing. It's warm, very resinous yet powdery, and has a little bit of an 80's classic feel."", 'This is the first Jayne Ormonde perfume Ive tried and I must say its an absolute quality of a fragrance. Tolu is an ambery, resinous, slightly powdery scent. I smell the orchid note distinctly as it peeks through the amber and resin notes. I also smell the orange blossom which keeps on for the duration of wear and makes this perfume somewhat fresh. Its a heavy perfume, with great longevity and sillage. I think its best to wear for night. Again, Quality.', ""Resins, raisins, ray-zings. This is how this perfume goes, in short. On my skin the initial blast of resins becomes sweet and slightly fruity, and then gets transformed into the warm rays of sun in a darkened wooden hall that had seen many joyful celebrations. This is a perfume that unfolds narratively, making me want to tell a story. Here's a woody blast of the cleaned wooden paneled room, a smells of holiday cooking (raisins) way, way in the distance, and then finally, the smell of smell of expectation of another holiday coming to the warm wooden house where they had many good times and celebrations. However, all this is slightly far away. You're inside the house, but you're not in the epicenter of cleaning, cooking, and expectation. Actually, if, like me, you're steeped in Jane Eyre, having read it about twenty times, you'll follow me: this perfume makes me think about a big ball in Thornfield hall from Jane's point of view -- somewhere far away up the stairs. In terms of perfume it means a skin scent, subtle, without loudness. Highly recommended. Thanks for a sample, dear friend."", ""I'm quite sure my good Fragrantica friend who sent me this dropped it in the envelope by mistake because I wouldn't give this to anybody. Not even my mother.  It's Awesome This develops along the lines of Black Orchid for me, i.e, spicy but well grounded in woody, orchid-y glorious goodness. I see previous reviewers are describing it as classy, sophisticated, feminine. I agree to a point, but this is too sensuously earthy to be that refined. I think this scent could be fronted by Gaby of Desperate Housewives. I.e, someone who is well kept, wears all the right clothes and goes to all the right parties, and plays with the lawn boy when the husband's not looking. Now that's Tolu - the well kept girl's secret"", ""extremely spicy and warm perfume, 'very Ormonde Jayne' perfume, because of it's airiness.  under the layer of spices which feel seriously bitter, but soft, it smells like very oriental milky rice and tea, which is odd perhaps. I see it as theme on 'rice' oriental perfumes, like Kenzo Amour or Trouble Boucheron's , just different take on it. This is how it feels to me. I don't feel very interested or excited"", ""Edible. Classy, layered, rich, dark and mysterious. I can detect notes like Tobacco, opoponax and citrus. A touch of powder, possibly amber, creeps in. Very warm and sophisticated. It's gorgeous."", 'Every perfume by Ormonde Jayne is a very nice experience. I find Tolu one of the best choices for these cold days. So balmy-woody-spicy sweet, not too sweet, with powdery final notes and very thin floral, I smell them after the first strong balmy wave passes by.  Very cozy, sophisticated, ultra feminine and classy, as Rebella said.', 'Among the perfumes I have tried from Ormonde Jayne I like Tolu best. It is a strange and subtle little perfume. Does it smell medical or does it smell flowers? Is it warm or is it cold? It is for sure longlasting, personal and still not hard to wear. I regret a bit that I finished off the others from Ormonde Jayne so quick, and I think I will give them another try later on.  Tolu smells a lot likes the bottle looks, classy and elegant. The base is lovely, warm, woody and with the slightest trace of smoke. Everyone who love perfumes should give some of Ormonde Jayne`s a try, maybe you will find a new favourite. Maybe it will be Tolu or maybe some of the other in the range. Try, try, try!', 'Geza Schoen is a fragrance wizard, and Tolu proves it. You think amber can\'t be part of an all-weather, signature fragrance? Wrong. Somehow, this fragrance is equal parts refreshing and heady. Every few minutes, for six hours or more, I catch a slightly different whiff of this on my skin. It\'s mercurial, evanescent, and delightful. At $150 per 50 mL it is not a ""cheapie,"" but I\'ve smelled fragrances priced twice as high that aren\'t as well balanced or delightful to my nose. A must-try for anyone who enjoys fine parfumerie, especially ambers.', 'Love at first sniff, this starts out with a gorgeous medley of citrus and orange blossom, woods, vanilla, powdery tonka, and a floral note up front that smells something like ylang-ylang.

To my uneducated nose I‚Äôm picking up an interesting amber composition, sweetened by tonka, sitting on a floral base. Orange blossom is here but very light, same with rose but it‚Äôs also a touch smoky, creating a drydown that is smoky floral. Another reviewer describes Tolu as strange, I agree, and think that‚Äôs why this one is particularly hard to describe. But it‚Äôs strange in a good way, I keep sniffing my arm trying to come up with adjectives. I just know that I love it. Feels very natural, soft and elusive.', ""A great scent to wear in chilly weather. Very warm and of course resinous. The tolu is strong in this one. It is a tad sweet but it is all perfectly balanced. After a while you detect the orchid, neroli and aromatics which prevent this becoming too heavy. They cut through the resins and define the fragrance and are more evident with time. Can you tell it's a winner with me yet? There is something about it that reminds me of cartier baiser du dragon but this is more interesting. I fear reformulation took away the fire in Cartiers dragons kiss. So sad. Further down the timeline and there is a soapiness which I don't mind for a change. I get good longevity and good sillage in this 20 degree room. I also think a fella could easily carry this one off. It is borderline unisex."", ""Tolu, oh my Tolu.  For me this is perfection. This scent is addictive! I got myself a big bottle recently - for an important b-day - after having waited a number of years since our first encounter. All Ormonde Jaynes are phenomenal creations, but are darn expensive.  This is a unique fragrance and a must try for the ones that, like me, love amber based, oriental, sensual frags in general.  It is sensual and very elegant, it never screams but it whispers. It's class, refinement, mistery, elegance. It is genderless in my opinion.  Starts off fresh and crisp with some bergamot/neroli/lotv, then goes balsamic on the juniper note, and mantains this freshness and transparency all the way through. It becomes powdery soon (amber, the resins) but still has a distinct note of exotic land, and this fresh, balsamic note. You cannot tell the flower notes distinctly, although you guess there is some powdery rose in it.  The drydown is the best part, you can feel all the creaminess of the tonka and the tolu resin. Good longevity and moderate sillage (all elegant frags have, they never scream).  A gorgeous one."", ""Very powdery. Smells like older cosmetics, makeup powders. Once I got past that, amber and citrus made themselves known. I'm sensitive to powdery notes, as they are my least favorite. To me, this smells primarily powdery, then amber second. I knew at first whiff that this was a no for me."", ""I feel like a traitor for not loving Tolu as much as the Fragrantica reviewers below. I do appreciate it - the warmth, the resin, the liberal dose of citrus...but after a while the base, which reminds me of caramels, grows tiresome. Perhaps it's because I don't particularly enjoy caramels. Or perhaps there's something missing in this base...somehow I want it to be deeper and darker. I suspect that layering Tolu with something dark could produce a truly fabulous blend."", ""Strange enough I also get a strong powdery nuance on my skin when trying Tolu. 'Powdery' isn't the best word to describe it, it is not like powder compact or dust, rather the air inside a milk-tea shop which uses soluble powder instead of actual milk and tea, intensely sweet and somewhat artificial.  I mainly get the aromatics and sweetness, minimal ambers, thus quite lacking depth. Not impressive on my skin."", ""Tolu is a really interesting scent. On my skin, there‚Äôs powdery incense, but also some very subtle florals. It's a little more bitter and green closer to the skin, but it's still warm and spicy and a little sweet. I don‚Äôt think I have tried anything similar. It smells quite different on clothing - it has a fresher opening that quickly introduces some sweetness. Although I really liked it at first, I decided after a few hours that it's far too powdery and mature for me. However, I definitely appreciate it and think it's worth sampling!"", 'This made me aware of how much I dislike orchid note in perfumes.  In this particular case I clearly detected the irritating note as a dull smell of some everyday hairproduct (shampoo, hair spray) appearing out of nowhere in the middle of what could otherwise be very smooth and sophisticated oriental. A single disonante turned Tolu to less niche, more mainstream-smelling creation. And there\'s a whole bunch of ""fresh flowers"" listed for a woody-oriental I must notice.. Also agree with the statement below - the opening is actually the best part of the composition. To me, it came close to being some sort of more transparent Cuir Ottoman; more clear - without the thick iris fog, more fragile - without the heavy sillage. ONLY IF without orchid.']"

One sniff and I fell in love. I love an anisic component (in this case absinthe) in a sweet fragrance (Love & Crime from Ex Idolo, Vanilla & Anise Jo Malone) ; this one nailed it. I love how its sweetness is sugary, and how the florals flirt with the absinthe No idea how artemisia smells like. This might be my favorite SL ü§≠ on par Ambre Sultan and Un Bois Vanille', 'I have a sample of this thanks to a wondeful fragrance friend named Shawn üíï  Douce Amere: soft, herbal, rounded and pastel. The vanilla here is more the thin confectionary coating on an almond. The absinthe note is gorgeous! I detect no alcohol burn- just the soft anise/wormwood vibe. The spices are soft and so is the lily.  This is such a magical fragrance and my only complaint is I want this to create a scent bubble but Douce Amere sits very close to my skin.  I don‚Äôt find this masculine- quite unisex. I don‚Äôt know why but when I think of a man that would embody this fragrance, it‚Äôs Theo James as Eddie in The Gentleman.', ""I'm not a fan of coconut and vanilla mixtures described as tiare at all, but this scent balanced out the stuffiness by adding the bitter green scent of artemisia. It reminds me of Guerlain's Angelique Noire and the Siwa of Memo too, though not exactly the same those two."", 'I was on a short trip to Paris and I defiantly wanted to go to Serge Lutens flagship store at Palais Royale so I could try all ""old"" perfumes that they sell now in bell jars because you can\'t find then anywhere else. I made a list of 8 perfumes that I wanted to test out and out of those eight I liked Douce Amber the most. It\'s really beautiful and interesting green vanilla scent but absinthe alcohol green like and because of that it leans more on the masculine side IMO. Yes it\'s sweet and little bit powdery but still it doesn\'t go into average sweet powdery vanilla scent profile. Definitely unique scent and everyone that likes vanilla as a note should definitely try this one because I don\'t think they will find anything similar to Douce Amere. In the end I got my bottle from Vinted (old Palais Royal version from 00\'s) because I was not sure how I\'m gonna use it if I buy bell jar version because I like to spray my perfumes. (they prob supple you with a small decant bottle that you can fill them up and then spray it but that\'s a bit annoying for me)', 'That opening! Herbal, bracing, verging on mentholated‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs stunning, but oh so fleeting. The green vanilla that remains in its wake is pleasant, but unremarkable and short-lived.', 'The best toothpaste scent ever!', 'I discovered Serge Lutens with Douce Am√®re, have loved it since (2002!). At the time, it was as niche as I had ever tried, and the unusual presence of artemisia and absinthe captivated me. An enchanting, real unisex perfume, so wearable by a woman that I have never been without it since, but gorgeous on a man - the salesman was wearing it to perfection. The longevity is very good, much better than newer Lutens fragrances, I have to say; it shares longevity with Un Bois Vanille, another Lutens favourite of mine.', 'Vanillic green woods, not sweet at all despite it being so creamy. Surprisingly cool and refreshing, though rather warm & soothing. Contradictory, but like with Serge Lutens scents, never offensively so.  Lovely in spring or autumn, I honestly prefer it in spring. Moderate sillage, lasts over 8 hrs in my experience with this scent.', 'This opens with a sensational wormwood oil, Artemisia absinthium, the very oil used in absinthe itself, and readily recognizable to those who have a penchant for this potion. Arresting and sharp, the herbaceous, bitter, tonic qualities of wormwood may perhaps read to one\'s noses as ""poison"" but to others as delicious. Of course, I am in the latter camp, and the anise and vanilla accords that soon follow reminds me so much of the taste of Leone Absinthe pastilles (you need to try them if you can!). The sugar cube in the heart quells the bitterness just a bit, and animated ornate absinthe spoons dance in a patch of Casablanca lilies, pollen flying everywhere, landing in bowls of cake batter and trays of anisettes. There is feasting and frenzy, and a bit of intoxication, and a warm satisfaction as it winds down and there\'s no room for one more digestif or even a wafer-thin biscuit, and I love feeling this satiated. The ghost of wormwood lingers for a long time, longer than any other fragrance I\'ve smelled that features this note‚Äîthat and the white florals prevent Douce Amere from being a full-fledged edible gourmand. It is an extraordinary example of Sheldrake\'s magic and of bitter-herbal contrasted with vanilla cake sweet.  Unfortunately, SL has now limited this beauty to the bell jars. I wish I knew the reasoning behind these decisions.', 'Just found a bottle of this scent--I forgot how cozy and comfortable it is. It\'s hard to believe it didn\'t do well enough in all markets to stay in the ""export"" line, as it always struck me as very loveable. What I appreciate most about it is that the bittersweetness is so well balanced. The wormwood and anisic notes are absolutely there, but the vanilla, musks, a light white florals provide such a complementary counterpoint. This has also always smelled to me a bit like Chergui but without the big coumarin note--in other words, the contemporary haziness of hedione, iso e super, and various white musks cocooning a huge vanilla. In Douce Amere, that beautiful base serves as the structure for a gorgeously green and herbal wormwood/white floral core instead of the spices and incense and hay of Chergui. Some other light touches of things (a hint of citrus and one of those pineapple-galbanum aromachemicals, maybe a light sprinkle of something like cinnamon) continue to contour and shape it.', 'At first I thought it smelled like poison, just wait 5 minutes before you try to sniff. It‚Äôs a bit masculine but sweet and snuggly', ""Do you want comfort in a bottle? I do and I've been wearing Douce Am√®re since the early 2000s when it was in spray format. It may seem a shame that it's now only available in bell jars but that makes it more special and uncommon. Not many people will have come across such a beautiful blend of scents in one fragrance: An opening of mild medicinal, absinthe, liquorice mix gives way to bitter almond (like the essence used in pastries), then the journey continues from marzipan to marshmallow (of the traditional type) to settle onto sweet vanilla. So you guessed it, we travel from bitter to sweet and back and forth - Douce Am√®re means bittersweet, how apt. It all comes in waves and it envelopes your senses in a beautiful comforting blanket that says sophistication and class."", 'As soon as I have applied this to my skin I was like ""eeek..this is Vinegar""! Indeed it has this acid start... Stunning how all Serge Lutens are able to strike me with strange notes at the beginning and then make me change my mind soon after.  No worries. The vinegar note is just the first seconds and is soon calms down.  Then Douce Am√®re is the softest frag of all. It is a stunning soft floral, very cozy and warm.  You can smell cinnamon, tiar√©, jasmine and a lot of vanilla, hence the sweetness.  Then there is this note of absinth - I like it for its powderiness and freshenes at the same time. Very well balanced... a lovely skin scent. I do not get the ""Bitter"" part (douce amere means sweet & sour), to me it\'s just sweet & soft.  Average staying power, not a lot of sillage. Very peculiar scent.', 'Very soft, creamy, a bit sweet fragrance, mix of herbal, powdery and gourmand notes.  Nothing to die for frankly speaking... Quite complex, no single note sticks out, almost no development in time, sits close to skin.', 'Douce Am√®re! More like douce AMOUR, am I right?! This fragrance is the equivalent of an oversized cardigan. Plush, warm, and comfy, something you‚Äôd wear to cuddle up with a good book. Douce Am√®re seems to run on two tracks: a green, herbal absinthe accord and a dryly sweet vanilla (whoever said ‚Äúcake batter‚Äù nailed it). As the scent matures on skin, the two accords soften, then converge. Douce Am√®re never smells ‚Äúperfume-y‚Äù; rather, it seems to just enhance one‚Äôs aura, radiating a sense of quiet goodwill to others in close quarters.  I agree with others who have noted similarities with Coty‚Äôs Vanilla Musk. That could suffice in a pinch, but it‚Äôs no true substitute for the beautiful nuance found here.', ""Douce Am√®re is a little startling at first: it smells equally strongly of sweet, gourmand notes and of prickly, inedible green ones, which creates the confusing effect that what you're smelling is in fact poison candy. But then the two aspects start to melt together and what remains is unmistakenly a typical Serge Lutens scent, a smooth and comfortably quasi-gourmand one with a bitter spicy edge that keeps it interesting. Very nice! The most dominant notes to my nose are artemisia, vanilla, sugar, and anise, in that order. I can believe the floral notes are there, but I can't separate them from the composition. Longevity and projection are both average, and to my nose it's more feminine than masculine, although I can imagine it on a man as well. Serge Lutens really must be the single most reliable source of wonderful, high quality borderline-but-not-quite-gourmand scents that are perfect companions for the colder seasons, and this is another shining entry in that long series. I'm glad to have it in my collection, although I'm not so smitten that my little decant won't serve me for quite a long time."", 'The perfect library scent for me and a fantastic creation to my nose! Old books on dusty shelves, peaceful solitude, and the vanilla comfort of a friendly, worn space. Afternoon shafts of light pouring through the decrepit yet happy windows, highlighting the dust specks. Tea is being served in an adjacent room into delicate little cups.

I feel that pretty accurately describes the gourmand feel: a dry cake batter Douce Amere is so expertly blended that no single note stands out, they are all there except for the jasmine (thankfully I can't pick it out). There is a slight tropical vibe, a slight gourmand vibe and a very slight spicy herbal vibe.  This is one of the easiest to wear from the Serge Luten line-up, but sadly I believe Douce Amere has been discontinued. I guard the remaining 20 ml I have left in my bottle and only wear it on special occasions. I think it's perfect accompaniement on a warm Spring or Fall day.

Whereas the Body Fantasies Red Velvet becomes screechy and plastic-like in the dry down, Douce Amere stays pleasant all the way through its development.

Really a pity it has been discontinued."", ""Someone elsewhere said that Douce Amere felt like the elegant, sophisticated, un-sleazy version of Casmir, which I think is about right. Casmir (which I also love) is a nasty lady until two hours in, at least; Douce Amere gets there within ten minutes. The openings are totally different--Douce Am√®re is an unusual blend of anise, cedar, peppery cinnamon (all together it is bitter green stems, the fresh-cut dahlia smell), that shifts (so smoothly you can barely tell) into powdery floral cedar smoke and incense-inflected vanilla. The combination of creamy gourmand and floral sweetness strongly resembles the later moments of Casmir--the later, the more alike. But Douce Am√®re remains more crystalline from start to finish. I'm convinced that's the bitterness, which you don't really smell after the opening but which makes itself known in the unusual lightness and clarity of a scent that would otherwise be oozingly scrumptious. It sits somwehre between clean white floral, oriental, and gourmand in a way I can't untangle. At times these two are so similar that I thought I'd made a redundancy mistake the first time I tried it on--but really it's like comparing a perfect raw almond to a honey-crusted, salted, sugared, roasted one. Both are good, but only one is the Platonic ideal of an almond. This is the only SL so far that doesn't turn on me, which I can wear and adore from start to finish. No matter how much put on it doesn't seem to project very far and I generally like that--though this is so good I almost wish it were louder. Longevity is okay--not as monstrous as most SL(why couldn't it have the lasting power of the ones that went putrid on me and gave me headaches?) or Casmir for that matter, but within the acceptable range for quality formulations. Unusually for me, and for Serge, I don't get any dirty notes on this at all.  Whenever I finally finish my big Casmir, I'll splurge and get a bell jar of this one. I have the 5ml mini flacon, dabbing only, and while that's wonderful, I'm terribly disappointed you can't get this in spray form anymore, even in France.

Since this is a solid sample, I don't want to guess on longevity and sillage when it's probably a bit different than liquid EDP, but my impression is that Douce Amere is a subtle, elegant frangrance, perfect for everyday wear.  Can't wait to try all of SL's other perfumes!"", 'This is my first time sampling a Serge Lutens fragrance. Hmm‚Äînot impressed! I tried some on this morning, on my arms, neck and behind the ears. 30 minutes later, on the bus, I wondered why I smelled damp umbrellas when it hadn\'t rained in 24 hours. It couldn\'t be Douce, could it?  Once I got to the office I smelled my wrist and thought‚Äîyummy, yummy, yummy! Smells just like the Byredo Seven Veils I tried yesterday. Then I realized, oh, it is the Byredo Seven Veils I tried on yesterday, which is showing amazing longevity despite time, a shower and numerous hand washings. I couldn\'t smell a trace of anything else which was strange as I had doused my arms in half of my 1ml sample of Douce.  Now, home again, I\'ve put some more on my arm and again I sniff. Uh oh‚Äîthere\'s that wet umbrella smell again, mixed with vanilla and light spices. Every time I bend my head to sniff my arm for another smell, my nose wrinkles. I already live in a rainy city‚ÄîI don\'t need a perfume that literally rubs my nose in the fact. Note: Upon sniffing my arm again a couple of hours later, the damp umbrella smell is gone (perhaps just a ""weird"" phase as another member described), and there is a refined, subtle spiciness that has emerged. However, the overall experience has been too underwhelming for me to try again any time soon.', ""I too sort of overlooked this lil gem; tried it years ago and reminded me of five o'clock (which came later); a bit cloying & not my thing. But I recently 'blind bought' a used bottle for peanuts and voila! what a sophisticated, original and impressive frag. it does indeed manifest a duality of pastis & wormwood, sharp & soft. even has a chanel pour monsieur vibe for the first 30 min which is very interesting and pleasant, drying down to a soft vanilla musk. great juice!"", 'ohh how lovely this juice is .  So refreshing different and luminous. Lilys mixing With anis and slightly sweet Herbs. Tiare flowres lingering to make it a bit tropical in a way ;) I love it.

This reminds me of the Hermes Un Jardin series refreshing and Nice but not that long lasting', ""I wanted to like this a lot more than I did. On my skin the woody cinammon and lily-heavy vanilla become cloying and sticky. First on, it's almost a vanlla and licorice scent, which I like, but is very strong and hard to take. It mellows as it dries, but comes out a fairly doughy vanilla pudding with licorice and cinnamon notes. Very sweet sticky gourmand with my chemistry. Try before buying for sure."", ""Just tried a SL's solid sample of this... opened with a skanky note to my nose... but within seconds I hardly smell anything... Pass..."", ""For me it's all about floral and vanilla - I like it; elegant and not overpowering; it is more underlining your personality ;)"", ""I was a bit shocked after reading both the notes and reviews on this scent.

Check. Florals......? Florals......? Florals.....? Musk? Check....wait a minute. No musk listed.  Bittersweet, or Douce Amere on me is an exotic gourmand. She starts out with a beautiful musky, warm, rich, anise vanilla which is very potent and true for a couple of hours. Then the cinnamon comes into the composition drying it out a bit and bringing a lovely wood note forward. Douce Amere is all about the anise and on me it never transitions into a secondary note. It's a true oriental perfume with everything nuanced to interact with the star~the mysterious Absinthe.  I used to have a bottle and traded it. It was just too much for me. It's been about 3 years and I recently ran across a sample that someone had sent to me in a swap. Apparently my tastes....or chemistry have changed. I wouldn't repurchase a bottle, I would never go through the whole thing. But a decant? I may very well search one out......"", ""I can clearly understand the love around this perfume, but this is a bit too floral for me, I expected more cinnamon, more spices, most of the stuff I get is heady tiare flower + some spices. You should try this, this as every Luten's is perfectly made and very high quality, they just don't work on me most of the time."", ""On me, the bitter outweighs the sweet in Douce Amere. Bitter in a good way. Like, the sweetness that is in there is just a ruse to get you lulled into complacency so the sharpish and slightly acrid anise can poke you a little bit. Just a little ‚Ä¶ but it's not exactly a friendly poke, either.  I think it's a little contradictory, and I enjoy wearing it."", ""I've been on a fence with this fragrance for over a year - but I finally took a step and splurged on a bottle. Douce Amere is all too floral and all too sweet for me for the first hour or so. Even at this phase it does not completely fail, the absinthe note gives a cool dissonant tone to the opening, the greenness and bitterness feels almost violent against the gentle backdrop. The pollen note is beautiful with the white flowers - well, after all I guess that it is the overwhelming sweetness that bothers me in the opening. But it sneakily evolves to something more wearable, to a fresh, gently spicy vanillic oriental with still a distinct absinthe note. Lightly woody with beautiful cinnamon undertone, still sweet (but not overtly so) and caressing. For me wearing this fragrance is bit like getting some sticky feeling goop to my fingers when baking - then ending up licking the fingers with a great satisfaction..."", 'Hmmm normally I love Serge Lutens, but this smells like stale cookie dough on my skin. Weird. Perhaps I got a bad batch.', 'After a weird opening one gets rewarded with lovely vanilla, lily, jasmin and woods: a fluent stream of velvet, in a very light color: ivory. My luck: I found a bottle on the net. This is so special, so elegant, so bizarre: get it back on the market people!!!', ""This is a nice, woody scent that starts a little too sweet on my skin but after a while the sweetness seems not so overwhelming. It's elegant and comforting and feminine without trying too much. It's a perfume for every day and every season that won't ever offend anyone. At the same time, I find it a bit boring. Not too comfy for my tastes -I prefer stronger, 'rounder' scents like amber and vanilla (this is vanillic rather than vanilla to me) or cocoa for this role- not too fresh or spicy, just a bit of everything. Also, I don't get the absinthe as others do; I adore Fou d'absinthe by LAP and this is nothing like it.  I'd probably wear it once in a while if I somehow found myself a bottle of this, but I can't see myself stretching my budget's limits to get it. Lasting power though is great, 10 hours and counting."", 'Sensual, sexy yet innocent, warm and elegant. In a word: feminine.', ""Have you a parfume you like to smell but not to wear? This is for me douce amere. Too dusty and dirty on my skin. It doesn't make me feel feminine and sexy. It doesn't protect me. It doesn't change me. And this is exactly what I ask a parfume: seduce me, protect me, change my mood. Anyway I understand it's a beautiful scent with a great idea: mixing bitter and sweet notes."", ""A wonderful sensual scent which would work well either for summer evenings or winter. If you like Arabie but find it just too much, try Douce Amere. It has that definate 'Lutens' base of spice and is overlaid with a very Shalimar like oriental of vanilla with a light anise like freshness which keeps it bright and herbal, rather than really plush. I really like this, but will probably stick to Shalimar as the budget won't stretch to owning several slightly similar fragrances!"", ""Oh this is nice and unlike anything else. I'm anticipating a new grandbaby, and this will be my new indulgence to wear around the baby. This to me is a comfort gourmand scent. Not unlike vanilla rice pudding with brown sugar and spices. This doesn't have to shout to be nice and noticed."", 'A very sensual( and now rare) interpretation of absinthe, in a very subtle manner. While it does not scream ""Fee Verte"", it is somehow similar to a vanilla white floral, but it gets some absinth-green aspects that remain throughout the entire stage of the perfume, even in the drydown. It is an oriental perfume, and, for sure, unisex( officially by Serge Lutens ). Unfortunately, it will be added to the exclusive line. I mananged to buy one bottle at the printemps store in Paris for 79 Euros. As an update: I do love it more in the spring or summer, because in the winter it is too cold-smelling. Also, I do detect a white-floral tiare/plumeria note out of this, which is fascinating.', ""I found this one very strange when I first tried it, but it grew on me and became one of my all time favourites. It's a unique fragrance in my experience."", 'Wow, I see the notes above. From the sample I got, it smelled nothing like that. It was coconutty and minty. I almost smelled marshmallow with a hint of licorice. After a while, it got powdery, but I could still smell a hint of coconut. It really dries down to a spicy vanilla without coconut/licorice.', ""Intoxicating and spellbounding on a first whiff, if you smells it from the bottle, seems compact, but after first spray, it scatters in the air, so you can enjoy in wonderfull mix of bitter - sweet harmony of natural vanilla and absinth. I sad harmony, because isn't too sweet, and isn't too bitter, / in opening something smells like bitter almond in combination with airy vanilla /. Far from gourmand or loud scent. Like a  voile that slides around you, and you want to catch it,but you couldn't. But after very short time becomes quiet and just settled down on your skin."", 'At first sniff, I do get the pollen-like effect mentioned in the description ‚Äì a lightly sweet, somewhat powdery scent with a bit of a dry herbal quality. This floats atop the aroma of a blooming white flower (I pick up jasmine mostly). The white flower scent is definately present, yet somehow softened, almost as if it were bleached by the sun.  As the perfume dries down, it develops more of a gourmand character. The sunny floral /herbal smell remains, but is now dusted with flakes of creamy chocolate just starting to melt in the warm air. The cinnamon and anise are not easily detectable to me, but do lend a delicate spiciness to the mix.  This fragrance is so well blended that none of the notes take over, but rather combine to form something unique and lovely. Why is this being discontinued?', 'Surprise! On opening the sample vial, the first thing I smelled was lots of sandalwood, not what I thought an absinthe-inspired fragrance should smell like. Within seconds, however, the anise came through loud and clear, like pure ouzo being drunk from a sandalwood cup. There‚Äôs something dry and herbal along with the wood and anise, presumably the artemesia that one would think should be a prominent note, and just a little hint of flowers. I like the fact that the cinnamon doesn‚Äôt overpower the anise, but instead blends perfectly with it. Wow! Once this develops it is unique and marvellous.  After a few hours it dries down into a mostly woody scent with notes of sandalwood and cedar, nice in its own right. Later, the vanilla becomes prominent, and for the last several hours it is a sweet and almost ambery skin scent. It‚Äôs a lovely sequence of very different perfumes, three for the price of one. Sillage is good, and the scent lasts all day in one form or another.  I read that Douce Amere being discontinued - why, oh why, when it‚Äôs one of the best SL creations?', ""The opening is vibrant. There is Absinthe listed on my card from Serge Lutens, not listed above in the notes. In the opening, the Absinthe comes through like licorice, a spicy anise, with a cutting dryness.  The Vanilla peeks out, but awaits in the background, letting the florals burst and bloom and play out. I cannot individually distinguish the floral notes, but they are a pungent bouquet.  The dry down comes too quickly for me, but it's such a beautiful mix of spirited Cinnamon, creamy, gourmand Vanilla, and very light Absinthe remains. The dry down has lasted for many hours now.  This is an artistic, lucious, luxurious, inspiring scent. One might use it daily to exeperience the best sensations in life at all times, or, use it only with the finest black velvet dress for special nights, to savour it slowly."", ""Douce Amere is quite unique, in the beginning as if it is not clear in which direction to develop, whether bitter or sweet (or vice versa) after a while you are lost in magic.I was amazed, I had to have it. I did not know even if I wore it, is not oriental, not spicy or citrus, and neither woody nor chypre. I have not felt so strange smell,tiare flower can be discerned, cinnamon is interesting, but I had the impression that there must be something more not mentioned, a closely guarded secret, endless and somewhat fragile. Attracting and repelling me, as I'm not sure do I like it or not. I love to wear it,though rarely,but then really enjoys. If there was a group of floral-spicy, it was a Douce Amere - totally different from anything I tried, so unusual...for ladies somewhere in Paris a hundred years ago, but the fragrance is just as inspiring today (only not dressed in jeans).Although the fragrance came out recently(2002.) it's intriguing as it has a long history. You can not say that it is sweet, because there is bitterness in it or some bitter sweetness.

Ever walk into an Italian bakery and smell the anise cookies, straight out of the oven? Ol' Serge (bet he'd hate to hear himself called that) and his buddy Sheldrake have nailed that scent dead on, mounting it on top of that signature Lutens base that's his own personal Guerlinade. This one is scrumptiously edible, and it's probably the ideal perfume to wear when your'e going out ot a nice Italian restaurant. Highly recommended. Of course, I AM a cook..."", ""I've never met a fragrance which fits its name so perfectly like this.  Douce Amere. Bittersweet. My first experience with it tested on my wrist has been rather disappointing so in this light I was not prepared for the loveliness of Douce Amere, but being a hot sunny day today I craved for a refreshing scent so I gave it a second chance.  The choice was just perfect. Bitter and sweet notes blended beautifully, none of them tried to dominate. Soon after the first sniff I envisioned ouzo.  Ouzo is an anise flavoured spirit (optionally added other flavorings, such as star anise, coriander, cloves, and cinnamon) traditionally known in Greece (and Albania as I know from a friend). It does not change drastically on the skin, this note never really fades made the scent so lively throghout the day. The sweetness is presented by flowers but I am unable to identify them although I'm fairly sure that I can't smell jasmine which is one of my favourite notes. The tenacity is exceptional - with a lovely sillage - considering that I sprayed it at 5am and 12 hours later I can still smell it in full bloom. (I have to admit that I could seen Douce Amere to tend annoying when the wheather warms up because of the toothpaste-like freshness.  Nevertheless, I would definitely want a bottle for the hot summer days.)"", 'I have regret my last review a little. I do love Douce Amere, but it¬¥s a soft, laidback and quiet kind of love.

Longlasting, beautiful, soft, mature and extremly caressing. I am feeling totally comfortable when I wear this.', ""Last time I tried this I was so taken aback by the soft scent-texture,I missed some of the intricacies of the top notes. Now I have my own tester it's a different story! The flowers rest tenderly underneath this strange spell of cream and absinthe and lilies. There is this peculiar sense of artemisia very gently sweetened, a soft airy quality. My partner dismisses it as aniseed, but just for once I may have to buy irrespective of his opinion.

This fragrance is the equivalent of an oversized cardigan. Plush, warm, and comfy, something you‚Äôd wear to cuddle up with a good book. Douce Am√®re seems to run on two tracks: a green, herbal absinthe accord and a dryly sweet vanilla (whoever said ‚Äúcake batter‚Äù nailed it). As the scent matures on skin, the two accords soften, then converge. Douce Am√®re never smells ‚Äúperfume-y‚Äù; rather, it seems to just enhance one‚Äôs aura, radiating a sense of quiet goodwill to others in close quarters.  I agree with others who have noted similarities with Coty‚Äôs Vanilla Musk. That could suffice in a pinch, but it‚Äôs no true substitute for the beautiful nuance found here.', 'As soon as I have applied this to my skin I was like ""eeek..this is Vinegar""! Indeed it has this acid start... Stunning how all Serge Lutens are able to strike me with strange notes at the beginning and then make me change my mind soon after.  No worries. The vinegar note is just the first seconds and is soon calms down.  Then Douce Am√®re is the softest frag of all. It is a stunning soft floral, very cozy and warm.  You can smell cinnamon, tiar√©, jasmine and a lot of vanilla, hence the sweetness.  Then there is this note of absinth - I like it for its powderiness and freshenes at the same time. Very well balanced... a lovely skin scent. I do not get the ""Bitter"" part (douce amere means sweet & sour), to me it\'s just sweet & soft.  Average staying power, not a lot of sillage. Very peculiar scent.', 'This is my first time sampling a Serge Lutens fragrance. Hmm‚Äînot impressed! I tried some on this morning, on my arms, neck and behind the ears. 30 minutes later, on the bus, I wondered why I smelled damp umbrellas when it hadn\'t rained in 24 hours. It couldn\'t be Douce, could it?  Once I got to the office I smelled my wrist and thought‚Äîyummy, yummy, yummy! Smells just like the Byredo Seven Veils I tried yesterday. Then I realized, oh, it is the Byredo Seven Veils I tried on yesterday, which is showing amazing longevity despite time, a shower and numerous hand washings. I couldn\'t smell a trace of anything else which was strange as I had doused my arms in half of my 1ml sample of Douce.  Now, home again, I\'ve put some more on my arm and again I sniff. Uh oh‚Äîthere\'s that wet umbrella smell again, mixed with vanilla and light spices. Every time I bend my head to sniff my arm for another smell, my nose wrinkles. I already live in a rainy city‚ÄîI don\'t need a perfume that literally rubs my nose in the fact. Note: Upon sniffing my arm again a couple of hours later, the damp umbrella smell is gone (perhaps just a ""weird"" phase as another member described), and there is a refined, subtle spiciness that has emerged. However, the overall experience has been too underwhelming for me to try again any time soon.', 'Hmmm normally I love Serge Lutens, but this smells like stale cookie dough on my skin. Weird. Perhaps I got a bad batch.']"

Ouarazate is, as expected from a country as culinary exquisite as Morocco, more of a feel good scent rather than something that will have you convening with the gods, like Avignon does, more so appetizing rather than polarising. The black pepper opening is very reminiscent of CdG black pepper, 'melting' into a smoky guaiac note, reminding me for a few milliseconds of peppered BBQ. Soon some light green undertones blend with the frankincense to remind us that incense is theme here. Dries down to a cedar-y, peppery incense skin scent.  Quite lovely, but not as memorable.

There's some aquatic calone-like note bumming me out."", 'I really wanted to love this because I absolutely adore every single fragrance in Series 3 collection and it would be so fitting if Ouarzazate was on the same level. But unfortunately it\'s just ok, which is especially disappointing because it was a blind buy and a gift.  Ouarzazate smells more like a restaurant than a sacred space. There\'s some sort of a spice in there that immediately transports me to a restaurant setting and reminds me of food. It\'s dry and herbal. Even too herbal, and the incense here really amplifies that. At the same time it\'s somewhat true to its name as I also do get a desert and sand vibe in it. But overall it\'s the least wearable perfume from Series 3, still interesting in its own way but too dry, herbal and bitter for me and, unfortunately, doesn\'t compare to the rest in this series. The longevity and sillage are also extremely weak. It probably will be the only one in the incense series I won\'t repurchase in the future.  P.S. the ""reminds me"" section in here is especially crazy, most of these are not even close to what Ouarzazate smells like.', ""if you like this one but concerned about the performance,take Cdg 2 edt, you'll get 20% better performance,2-3 feets more projection and 1 hour prolonged longevity... if you like that much go for vetiver 46 from le labo, you'll get 30% better performance... basically these 3 are one same fragrance under different brends and packaging. nevertheless,wonderful perfume, pure perfection."", 'Got a sample with my Avignon purchase and oh, my, the pepper and tea piled on top of incense is breathtaking. On my skin rich, spicy without leaning into wearable curry territory (looking at you, Gujarat by Olympic Orchids), warm without being cloying. Probably my favourite one so far out of the series, but I still need to try Zagorsk and Jaisalmer', 'Fresh spicy incense Decoding or finding notes in this fragrance is difficult as all the notes are used in a very balanced combination, except incense which is the main concept of this series. But it could be categorized as almost a fresh and spicy work because of black pepper, nutmeg, and anise. In the background, there is an aromatic, and green notes of clarysage and green tee. This a soft fragrance especially for the incense category and is wearable as an incense fragrance.  I also tested Jaisalmer, another one from the CDG incense series, that one was warm spicy but this one is fresh spicy. To me, Ourzazate and Jaisalmer are like two sketches from one concept while one (Ourzazate) goes into the aromatic fresh direction and the other one (Jaisalmer) in the warmer direction. The backbone of both fragrances is solid woody.  Overall, I am not excited enough about this one to put it into my buying list, but it is masterfully created. 6.5/10', ""Intriguing scent. After exploring different incense scents this one stand out. It's not sweet like avignon, it adds certain freshness and spicyness to incese, it makes it more upbeat and more cheerful, very interesting"", ""A peppery/spicy incense that does not seem to have much staying power, (like its sisters), but might be useful in layering with dryer, vetiver-based fragrances such as Heeley's Vetiver Veritas. Or maybe just to be savoured on its own by incense-lovers everywhere!"", 'From the whole series, my least liked. Extremely subtle and frankly underwhelming. Began with a heavy citrus/sour body, then after a few minutes transitions to a admittedly calming and pleasant incense + wood + tea scent. Sounds great, except unless I literally spray it in my nose, its imperceivable after 30 minutes - 1hr and certainly has next to zero sillage and projection. Its not unlike listening to one of your favorite songs via your headphones, but on the lowest possible volume and then going for a walk on a busy street. Sometimes you will hear (smell) something you like, but just barely, and before you know it the song is over (the scent has gone)', 'Mmm a very nice incense, a burning fireplace with some christmas spices popping, but clean and not too sweet.

Comparisons to 2 MAN are very apt; it's really similar but trades 2 MAN's crisp aldehydes for a really enticing vanilla/warm spice that isn't present in the first fragrance.

It's also perhaps the most unusual and intriguing. Strong black pepper and pungent dried sage at the start, I get a very dark green, herbaceous feel from it, like a strange plant unfurling its leaves in a dank potting shed. But in a great way! As it settles in a slightly sweeter resinous scent, the musk and nutmeg come through, and it gets browner, warmer and dryer. This one is perhaps the most difficult to describe. My least worn, as it feels more daring than the others. I've been trying to pin down what it strongly reminds me of and I'd swear it's Tauer's L'air du D√©sert Marocain- does anyone else get this? In short I love it, as I do the entire range, but it certainly took more getting used to than the others, and I very rarely wear it. It's definitely not an everyday scent, but then, what great scent is?"", ""Ouarzazate is the most cologne-like of the Comme des Garcons incense series. Like the others, it is subtle and does not have strong projection, but it lasted through a full workday. It's unisex, but just a touch too masculine for me. Highly recommend if you are looking for a subtle incense-based men's fragrance."", 'I was young. I was wearing this. I LOVED telling people complimenting me that it was ""Ouarzazate de Comme des Gar√ßons"". NO I\'M NOT WEARING Acqua Di Gio, like half the boys in the yard. Yes, Ouarzazate was my milkshake. Years later, I would love to smell it again. A sniff of my twenties. I remember a spicy resinous incens, on the sweet side.  I recently stumbled into Camel, which reminded me of it. Maybe, I should let Ouarzazate be a smell of the past, like on oasis I once travelled to. Was it all a dream?', 'Having not been to Ouarzazate myself, let alone Morocco, I have to place in the perfumer‚Äôs shoes and nose, reimagining the scene as it played out in my mind. With the inspiration laid out in front of me, the scent transported me to the historic city itself. The fragrance placed me in a busy Kasbah of Taourirt, setting up on the high atlas mountain city upon the first sniff. It was bustling with trading activities among the merchants in the middle of an arid and bracing day, with fine sand picked up by winds brushing against my skin. To my left, the residents welcomed the sight of the travelling caravan that just arrived from Timbuktu, herding a flock of camels and slaves carrying precious cargo of spices and gold. To my right, a few people sought refuge in a makeshift tent, sipping tea in ornate cups. As I navigated through the bustling area, I picked up the abundance of spices in the air, well in this case, on my skin. I detected the bracing note of pepper caressing my skin, complementing well with the almost spicy-sweet aroma emanating from the nutmeg. What draws me most to the top notes of Ouarzazate was the incredible and yet, the mystical balsamic smell of incense. The smoky profile permeated through the air, exuding the mysterious vibe of Arabia as the merchants warmed this precious ingredient on a burner nearby. Ouarzazate‚Äôs heart notes transitioned past the half-hour mark due to the visible presence of clary sage. A herb that Morocco is known for, it emitted out a distinctive herbaceous, earthy aroma on my skin. The introduction of wenge wood, a legume tree native in the Republic of Congo, elevated the perfume profile to be very woody. Also, the direction the fragrance takes me became incredibly darker, suggesting one of the cargoes the camels were carrying were being traded to the carpenters for decorative types of furniture. My curiosity got the better of me while I scoured through the goods merchants were bringing in from the middle east, before discovering several cargoes containing precious vanilla pods and priceless musks. These elements were fairly noticeable on my skin, adding complexity to Ouarzazate‚Äôs middle scent profile with a subtle sweetness and powderiness respectively. With the sun setting across the horizon, it was my cue to seek out food. As I proceeded out of the bazaar, I walked past a small merchant selling imported leather goods and hides from his table. The labdanum‚Äôs scent profile attributed this image when Ouarzazate metamorphosised on my skin to its base notes after the four-hour mark. This, combined with the soothing properties of Kashmir wood, left my pulse points some warmth remnants from the evening sun. The blond wood‚Äôs existence was a genius move by the perfumer himself, suggesting it harmonises well with the other prominent notes such as frankincense and clary sage. All in all, I am generally happy with the perfume‚Äôs overall structure and performance of Ouarzazate on my skin. While I do have a slight complaint on its persistence and concentration (I wish for it to be in the Eau de Parfum strength), my takeaway for this perfume would be to bring the bottle (or a decant) with you to freshen up during a warmer and humid climate. In theory, it should perform well on a slightly arid and calmer landscape. But, it all boils down on your body‚Äôs chemistry and preference. Rating: 8.5/10 Read the rest of this post on my perfume blog found on my Fragrantica page.', ""Having spent several days in Ouarzazate during my last trip to Morocco, I was excited to give this perfume a try. It is lovely, although I didn't get much of a 'mosque' vibe from it.  It has a certain feeling of 'distance', a bit austere and cold (as I imagine all 'churchy' incense fragrances do, regardless of what type of church, mosque, or temple they are trying to invoke). This speaks, perhaps, more to my own relationship with these types of smells than the smells themselves. This is not to say that it was unpleasant in any way, only that it didn't make me want to curl in on myself the way a warmer perfume might.  What it DID do, and spectacularly, was transport me to a place of serenity. It's not the type of perfume I would wear on a date night, but if I were feeling particularly quiet and reflective I'd reach for this in an instant. Unfortunately, this perfume disappeared from my skin within a couple of hours. Perhaps that's appropriate for this type of fragrance - I don't know that someone would necessarily want to smell like this all day.  In the end, my return trip to Ouarzazate was all too brief, and for that reason I have to give this one a pass."", ""Loved it, as I loved all of the CDG incenses - this one has a particular airy, dry, spicy sweetness and less resin than any of the others. On me it seemed to have a bunch of cinnamon sticks, too, but apparently not. Would be a straightforward want, except that the longevity on me was atrocious - skin only by 15 minutes in and totally gone in 45. Desert mirage that leads you on with promises of great things, but vanishes the nearer you get. What a shame, but I'll start saving for some Tauer ADDM, or CDG Avignon, instead."", ""Spicy woods with just enough vanilla and incense in the background. The best of the CdG Incense series, and would be one of my favorite fragrances period if its performance weren't so bad. It lasts maybe a few hours with soft sillage until becoming a skin scent. I'm going to try it in the summer to see if the heat improves it. I would love to find a heavier version of this, but no such luck as of yet."", 'I love this one and is my favorite of the series. Mostly I smell fresh, cool, peppered woods mingling with an herbal greenness, some frankincense and some labdanum and a touch of vanilla in the base giving it a bit of sweetness in the drydown. I register this scent more as a ""woods"" than an ""incense"". And of the outdoorsy variety. It\'s a fairly quiet scent and lasts longer over a little body oil. Also great for layering with a rose or amber perfume/oil. I wore it layered over Aftelier\'s Ancient Resins body oil tonight to a meditation group and it wafted softly around me while still being unobtrusive and was super calming and uplifting for me. I will add that I\'ve gotten more compliments on this scent than probably any other that I wear.', 'The whole series is a must have for incense lovers. This one is a spicy incense with pepper and nutmeg. Evokes the perfume in Moroccan mosques. Beautifully put together with moderate projection and sillage.', ""the first thing that strikes me is the incense without the burnt smell-beautiful....strong without overwhelming. the second notes i get are a tea and dry paper-i am reminded of going into a old used bookstore-with a teapot waiting wafts of jasmine faintly reaching your nose, and the welcoming sight of old books-proudly displayed, their pages quietly crackling as you turn them. there is no sweetness with the tea-but there are spices-sage and nutmeg-mixed with jasmine-i don't get any peppery and only the faintest of vanilla-barely there. the smell of the musk rounds out the edges-this must be the cashmir wood-it reminds me slightly of a very dry cedar-i love it, i am finding i enjoy the dry tea smells very much-as long as they aren't sweet-or overly vanilla-it seems that is where i come to dislike these scents- - i recently realized that the problem is heavily fake vanilla, sugar, tea and caffeine all blended together have a sad memory attached to it-and when i smell them-i actually get an physical ache in my chest- and it is a situation that is better off left alone. this perfume has been on for a couple of hours, and it shows no signs of fading into a skin scent-honestly-i thought it would do so within the first hour-i am glad i am wrong!"", ""Incense over a peppery, powdery, almost musty base. Smooth and polished. Dry but not dusty, like smoothly planed wood. At the same time there's an herbaceous quality, not the zingy aromatic herbs but that of dry hills. Subtly soapy, a smooth, expensive soap. I accidentally dumped half the contents of a sample on myself but it's not loud at all; started off with a very modest sillage and pretty much turned into a skinscent an hour later. I know this is supposed to be Morrocan but to me it smells like a Japanese temple, especially during the long dry down. A subdued and refined fragrance but not boring. Lovely and very wearable."", ""la serie 3 di CDG ha proposto negli anni variazioni sul tema dell'incenso, come nota comune di esperienze spirituali assai diverse (cattolicesimo, induismo, islamismo etc etc). questo che provo oggi, ispirato all'islam, √® piuttosto diverso da quanto mi aspettavo. bench√® centrato sul franchincenso, questo piccolo delizioso esercizio di stile, √® poco invasivo: pur restituendo le impressioni di un magreb fatto di te alla menta, spezie e resine, ci riesce in maniera poco orientale. l'impressione √® elegante, quasi si trattasse di un soffio leggero di brezza mediterranea, e si dipana attraverso sensazioni mai prepotenti. come gi√† detto si rintracciano note di menta, legni, spezie e resine, nessuna in particolare, tutte a mostrarci un pomeriggio passato in un giardino con alberi di limone. molto buono, evocativo, peccato che sia davvero troppo leggero."", 'Ah, the Incense series! Avignon and Kyoto get all the attention, but I think that‚Äôs just because those are the only two people aren‚Äôt afraid to pronounce. Ouarzazate is the biggest mouthful of the bunch, but while the name says come-with-me-to-the-Kasbah the style is 100% Comme des Garcons. To me the opening impression is that of minty tea. There are just tiny hints here and there of sage and of something I think of as animalic that is probably the labdanum. It settles down pretty quickly into a peppery/papery version of the dry wood thing that CdG does so well. I do not find it very incensey in the way I normally think of incense (which is to say: ‚Äúburning‚Äù), but it does have a resinous quality that I think is supposed to stand for unburnt frankincense. The longevity and projection could be better, but in the world of nichey frags the price is surprisingly good. Yes, I how that CdG is technically designer. Shh! I don‚Äôt care.', ""If such a thing as Gucci pour Homme eau d'ete (or fraiche) had been released this would be it (not GPH II for sure).

Soft and bold all at once, spicy and musky. Its fresh without being overly green, its musky without smelling like an '80's powerhouse. Great Fragrance. Plays well with others.  Lasts about 5-6 hours and dies down for another 2-3."", 'A new purchase for me (just purchased the entire CdG incense series), and already one of my favourite incense perfumes. I love the sage in this one.', 'There is only one word for this perfume--boring! This goes right up there with the likes of other overpriced niches like Gypsy Water and Oolong Infini. What is incense about this? Where is the palo santo or any of those other beautiful notes? This opens with an unexpected and intense citrus note, and it quickly dries down into a synthetic and linear tea scent. I am not Muslim, but I HIGHLY doubt this reminds anyone of incense used in Islam. Anything I have sampled from this CDG line has been a huge let-down, esp Avignon. There are much better incense perfumes on the market than any of these. Sillage and projection are pathetic. This perfume is more boring than watching snails race.', ""This one is the sweetest out of all from Incense Series that I've tested (Avignon, Zagorsk, Quarzazate). Starts off sweet-smoky, the sweetness is dominating, I'd say. It comes from guaiac wood-vanilla mix and probably some sweet fruits. Then incense comes into the game and starts its play. It's smooth and rather quiet compared to Zagorsk or Avignon. The sweetness stays put and you can still feel it. Later on mild herbal-green notes appear, especially tea (which smoothens composition even more), sage, anise and labdanum. I regret that cashmere wood is so barely detectable, I love its smell and it would make the fragrance more appealing and interesting for me. Sadly, this fragrance lasts approx. 3-4 hours on me. It's the shortest lasting incense from CdG... Very, very sad. Nevertheless I like it and I like contemplating while wearing Quarzazate."", 'The reviews of the Comme des Gar√ßons Incense series never cease to amaze me. I cannot tell if ""mistakes were made"" chez decanters or it\'s simply that the various components of these similar yet distinct perfumes are variously salient to different noses under different sniffing conditions!  To my nose, today--at 10:40 am EST, post-coffee and before eating, on a frigid day in the greater metropolitan Boston area--this one, Ouarzazate, is more woody and less green than Jaisalmer (which I was wearing yesterday and I have sprayed on the inside of my knees today, lol). I do find Ouarzazate to be herbal in a different way (no pine sap here!) and I also clearly and distinctly smell labdanum... Some reviewers find the herbal quality horrible; others don\'t detect it at all. And where in the world are these claims about jasmine and florality coming from??? Good lord!  Anyway, whatever anyone else is smelling, I can affirm that my bottle is good (to my nose, today--at 10:40 am EST, post-coffee and before eating, on a frigid day in the greater metropolitan Boston area)!', ""A bit more floral than others in this series, and I get more pepper than incense. While it is nice, it didn't wow me like Kyoto and Avignon did."", ""I've been eager to review this one because I remember it being different enough from the other four to treat it like its own entity. The first time I tried it, it was like no other fragrance I'd ever experienced, like ethereal jasmine on top of wood. It's very tea-like and otherworldly right from the start...the top notes are a quiet, moderately sweet blend of flowery black tea and nicely grained wood, but not resinous, exotic wood. It's very simple, but in a comforting way, not a harsh or minimalist way. I see an image of plainly finished but contemporary furniture and sleek tableware in an elegant home, and they're made of solid conventional wood, with a non-edgy, semi-asian-inspired design. The scent has just a hint of something that reminds me of C. Howard's violet candies, but not enough to bother me like some violet notes. I only start to notice the jasmine (lotus?) in the residue on the tip of my nose after sniffing my sample. It's there, not as strong as I remember, but getting stronger throughout the mid notes. Oddly enough, the wood actually seems to fade out and the florals to fade in. I'm not sure if you could officially call it a masculine floral, but after trying so many of those that I didn't like, this is really something that I could get lost in and also wear comfortably in the real world. I kind of wish it were stronger for how expensive it is, but the translucency, balance and restraint are just outstanding; it can't possibly be so simple and yet so perfect."", 'Bright almost lemony/Limey citrus (from the labdanum perhaps?) in this is so invigorating! Very woody and then as you inhale deeper you get a spicy edge of incense and pepper. Drys down to a lovely close scent which is unlikely to offend anyone...incense lover or not. Ouarzazate was not what I was expecting at all. I thought I wanted this collection to go in a Stronger, harder direction but this much lighter offering is just the tonic and my favourite so far, from an interesting bunch. This collection truly takes you on a unique journey with each fragrance and this one is probably the most conventional, and accessible wearable amongst them.', ""Smoky but lighter and airier than Avignon with a touch of very gentle (not syrupy) sweetness, probably from the green tea - ? It's the smoke note that intrigues me the most. Even throughout the drydown, while it gets lighter and balmier, the smoke remains.  As it develops it begins to remind me of a frag I used recently and I'm killing myself to remember the name. Aaurgh, this is going to keep me up all night. Maybe ELdO Afternoon of a Faun?  Very nice but possibly too gentle for me. It seems a little too close to the skin to justify a purchase."", 'Not at all what I expected - very citrus-like and fresh and green, none of the usual sensual and bewitchingly dark foreboding of frankincense. Come to think of it, WHERE is the frankincense? On my skin this is a playful, rather masculine citrus scent. Avignon got 10 out of 10 from me. Since citrus fragrances are not my thing, Quarzazate only makes it to 6/10. Still have to investigate Kyoto and Jaisalmer.', 'Oh Ouarzazate what can I say about you? Only the best! At least from the incense collection Ouarzazate is the nicest scent to my nose. It opens up with a blast of citrus fruit and then later settles on to an incense tea combination. At the base there is also the guaiac wood there that gives it a woody character to round it up. <3 this scent', ""Buy a bottle of pure cedarwood EO. That is what Ouarzazate smells like (I happen to have a bottle of the EO and compared the two. They're identical). Nothing more. I really can't smell the complex layers of notes that others describe. Terribly disappointed."", 'This is a lot like 2 Man minus the prominent frankincense note plus oranges and spices. Ok, this is put very simply, but the difference between this and 2 Man is just way too small, i blind bought this and i own both this and 2 Man and there is really no need to have them both since they are very much alike. If i had to choose between this and 2 Man it would be the latter though, this is more fresh while 2 Man is darker and paradoxically more incense like then Ouarzazate. Scent: 9/10 great, gentle, soft, versatile. Originality: 2/10, 2 Man is basically the same with few different elements.

After few minutes tea becomes apparent. It also has floral notes, probably the jasmine. The frankincense is very strong and stays until the end. The floral and tea part reminds me of GPH2.', ""Mmm... I've had this one for 3 months now and it's becoming harder and harder to choose it for any occasion... it's got certain interesting moments which last for many hours but zero projection and the worst part for me is its herbal vibe. Herbal as in a thick chicken with bitter herbs all around and guaiac wood so loud... I sound contradictory : Is it a strong or soft perfume? well... you barely notice it but when you smell it from very close, it's chicken and herbs. Perhaps my being vegetarian doesn't help to enjoy this fully, lol... but it's so annoying when you have to apply half a bottle to get a hint of a perfume... and even worse when the actual smell borders on bitter food. It could be a great male scent if they took that part away... and it's quite unpredictable when applied to women. Sometimes it gives them a certain allure I would at least try in case you girls were tired of sickly sweet and floral perfumes. A very bad start for CDG Incense series in my Carestinian life... I'll check the other ones and comment on them. I didn't even feel this as an incense anyway... disappointing."", 'Ouarzazate opens up with a clearly anise note that disappears in a blink of an eye giving space to a guaiac wood note accompanied by spicy notes, specially pepper.  through time this combination almost completely disappears leaving a herbal/incense tone which gives a very peaceful sensation in a wonderful drydown.', ""Ouarzazate is less particular than Avignon, and more playful than Kyoto, the only two others in this series I know. It would actually make a great mainstream men's fragrance, and I mean this as a compliment. It's balanced, subtle but noticeable, beautiful to smell but not extravagant, and a fragrance that straight men wouldn't be embarrassed to wear in a group of straight men. All the attributes of a classic men's scent."", 'Right out of the gates this slight little thing is linden bract, pepper, and jasmine. ""Alright!"" one thinks, ""This could be my day!"" 2o minutes later, the dry/let-down is nearly identical to Mr. Buxton\'s 2 Man, which, though excellent, make one wonder if that vivacious, sweet/green/astringent opening was just a lovely dream.

After a half hour some spices are added to the mix, mostly nutmeg, and a sweet vanilla-labdanum amber with hints of dried fruits becomes apparent. There‚Äôs very little sillage at any point, but the faint drydown does last for 5-6 hours on skin. Ouarazate is a warm incense-resin amber that‚Äôs light but lovely.', 'Just like Jasper, I bought a decant of this frag ""out of curiosity and educatioanal purpose"". The opening is indeed very peppery, dry, even bitter and smoky. But as time goes by, it becomes sweeter, woody and very feminine. I would even say sexy. On me it has a very good sillage. I can smell it on my wrist all day long, and I can`t stop sniffing :-).', 'Not bad at all. I could consider buying a small bottle for its originality. Very green, more than I tought. My opinion changed...I LIKE THIS like all incense series by CDG. 4/5', 'All i get from this is black pepper. I honestly detect no other notes at all. It actually made me sneeze after getting too close a whiff. Its boring and poorly done in my opinion and the bottle looks cheap, like an axe/tag body spray.', ""Surprise, surprise! I didn't expect to like this, just bought a tiny decant out of curiosity and educatioanal purpose! ;) I test Ouarzazate along side Avignon. The top note battle won by Ouarzazate. It opening softer and light. But the drydown is even nicer, smooth and warm incense. There is just a tinge of sweetness in it which would make this scent unisex."", ""This one paralysed me instantly. So much pepper surrounded by spices and incense, the note of sage gives the fragrance some nice bitterness, nutmeg - some sweetness and all that blends into a very unusual and unique aroma. I've never been to Maroco but if that's what its markets smell like, then they smell truly divine.  I can imagine myself wearing this fragrance on a very warm summer day."", 'I tried this fragrance once and feel in love with it.

NO I\'M NOT WEARING Acqua Di Gio, like half the boys in the yard. Yes, Ouarzazate was my milkshake. Years later, I would love to smell it again. A sniff of my twenties. I remember a spicy resinous incens, on the sweet side.  I recently stumbled into Camel, which reminded me of it. Maybe, I should let Ouarzazate be a smell of the past, like on oasis I once travelled to. Was it all a dream?', 'A new purchase for me (just purchased the entire CdG incense series), and already one of my favourite incense perfumes. I love the sage in this one.', 'Bright almost lemony/Limey citrus (from the labdanum perhaps?) in this is so invigorating! Very woody and then as you inhale deeper you get a spicy edge of incense and pepper. Drys down to a lovely close scent which is unlikely to offend anyone...incense lover or not. Ouarzazate was not what I was expecting at all. I thought I wanted this collection to go in a Stronger, harder direction but this much lighter offering is just the tonic and my favourite so far, from an interesting bunch. This collection truly takes you on a unique journey with each fragrance and this one is probably the most conventional, and accessible wearable amongst them.', ""Overall: 8.5/10 Here's Why: Smoky, Green, Soft, Strong and Vintage.  This is a cathedral of a fragrance. Sprawling and wide, open for interpretation.  Soft and bold all at once, spicy and musky. Its fresh without being overly green, its musky without smelling like an '80's powerhouse. Great Fragrance. Plays well with others.  Lasts about 5-6 hours and dies down for another 2-3."", 'I love this one and is my favorite of the series. Mostly I smell fresh, cool, peppered woods mingling with an herbal greenness, some frankincense and some labdanum and a touch of vanilla in the base giving it a bit of sweetness in the drydown. I register this scent more as a ""woods"" than an ""incense"". And of the outdoorsy variety. It\'s a fairly quiet scent and lasts longer over a little body oil. Also great for layering with a rose or amber perfume/oil. I wore it layered over Aftelier\'s Ancient Resins body oil tonight to a meditation group and it wafted softly around me while still being unobtrusive and was super calming and uplifting for me. I will add that I\'ve gotten more compliments on this scent than probably any other that I wear.', ""This one is the sweetest out of all from Incense Series that I've tested (Avignon, Zagorsk, Quarzazate). Starts off sweet-smoky, the sweetness is dominating, I'd say. It comes from guaiac wood-vanilla mix and probably some sweet fruits. Then incense comes into the game and starts its play. It's smooth and rather quiet compared to Zagorsk or Avignon. The sweetness stays put and you can still feel it. Later on mild herbal-green notes appear, especially tea (which smoothens composition even more), sage, anise and labdanum. I regret that cashmere wood is so barely detectable, I love its smell and it would make the fragrance more appealing and interesting for me. Sadly, this fragrance lasts approx. 3-4 hours on me. It's the shortest lasting incense from CdG... Very, very sad. Nevertheless I like it and I like contemplating while wearing Quarzazate."", ""The worst of the incense series. This one is nauseating to me. There's some aquatic calone-like note bumming me out."", 'There is only one word for this perfume--boring! This goes right up there with the likes of other overpriced niches like Gypsy Water and Oolong Infini. What is incense about this? Where is the palo santo or any of those other beautiful notes? This opens with an unexpected and intense citrus note, and it quickly dries down into a synthetic and linear tea scent. I am not Muslim, but I HIGHLY doubt this reminds anyone of incense used in Islam. Anything I have sampled from this CDG line has been a huge let-down, esp Avignon. There are much better incense perfumes on the market than any of these. Sillage and projection are pathetic. This perfume is more boring than watching snails race.']"

I expected this perfume to smell more like Rien Intense Incense from ELDO, which gives me Hinduism feel from the first spray. But to me Jaisalmer mostly smells like cloves and wine (mulled wine?). A little sweet, a little bitter, very pleasant and interesting. I like it a lot and I wish so much it was a stronger smell, I would wear it all year around. The incense in it is still very distinct and enjoyable, it's a very unique take on it. I am glad Jaisalmer is in my incense collection and it's definitely not the worst one in the Series 3 (I am looking at you, Ouarzazate...) but yeah, the performance is a major flaw and probably will be the only reason I might not repurchase the bottle in the future."", ""Opens with warming spice notes.

I tested both on some paper and found that Jaisalmer is basically what Memoirs would smell like if you took the vanilla out. So, this might be good for people who wanted to like Memoirs but don't like vanilla. For me, the projection and sillage of Jaisalmer is so poor that I'll just keep wearing the stronger of the two. I do like a more powerful fragrance though, so somebody who likes subtlety might enjoy this."", ""Warm spicy incense The spice in this one is used in its realistic natural form that gives it a rough texture.

However, if you are seeking the calm/meditative state and comfort that many associate with incense -- while avoiding any potential complaints about your fragrance from co-workers -- Jaisalmer may be perfect for you. Upon first spray, I definitely noticed a tart ""red berry"" note with a discreet dusting of cinnamon. Before long, the cedar made an appearance -- it smelled very similar to a small cedar ""treasure chest"" I\'d picked up as a vacation souvenir as a child. (This was a welcome development, as perfumes with cedar listed as a note sometimes turn sour on my skin... I was glad to find one that truly smelled like cedar wood!) It felt warm, inviting, and alive. The overall impression was one of a cedar chest in which spices had once been stored. I found myself liking it, even though I had originally started out in search of a power perfume that screamed ""smoky incense!!"" (This isn\'t that. It whispers, and it isn\'t smoky.) It didn\'t remind me of incense, per se, but that may simply be the result of my culture and life experiences. Yours may differ. (Maybe this *is* what incense smells like in this city. If so... I want to visit!) As for projection and longevity... both are minimal. (If I had to make a direct comparison between completely unrelated perfumes based solely on longevity and projection, I\'d say... Jaisalmer is ""less than 4711"" minimal. And 4711 is pretty close-sitting and short-lived... so, you get the idea.) Jaisalmer flies under the radar of most people. This is the type of perfume you wear for yourself. In my experience, no one will smell this on you unless they are within hugging distance (though this did result in compliments, so that\'s a plus). It does require frequent reapplication -- and that makes me wear it less often than I\'d like to, given the cost of the fragrance -- but if you like it and it resonates with you, it\'s worth having in your collection.', 'Starts out with a smell of a gas station but quickly turns to a very nice incense and ceder fragrance.

If it were a person, it would be reserved to an uncomfortable degree (and I am fairly reserved, but I think this person is ten times worse than me) and with a sense of humor so dry, no one can ever figure out if they‚Äôre joking or not. And then they disappear and you‚Äôre not even sure if they were ever in the room with you, to begin with, or maybe you imagined the whole thing. Jaisalmer is a tremendously peppery affair, with transparent woody notes, and fleeting dusty cardamom aspects that are marvelously charming but also quite fleeting.

Jaisalmer is a beautiful warm piquant fragrance with clear notes of cinnamon, pine, and cardamom. As it dries down, you get a constant throb of pepper and wood. It's as if you're walking into a South-East Asian spice market and perusing through all the different jars of spices. It does lean more on the sweeter side than other spicier fragrances, but it is by no means saccharine.  Overall it is really just such a pretty scent and I don't tire of smelling it on me, much like the rest of Series 3: Incense. It's also a very flexible unisex scent, being able to be worn throughout the day and into the evening.  Th only downside is its projection and longevity. Jaisalmer's sillage is mediocre at best and that's after a very liberal spraying. It's longevity is weak, lasting at most a couple of hours on my skin.

Like diving into a giant 50-metre vat of the stuff, except it's not at all choking, nor overdone; somehow, though dry as dust, it strokes rather than suffocating. The rest of the spice is soft and subtle, all arid no acrid. Beautiful gaiacwood so sweet and gentle I took it for sandalwood, only an especially classy and upmarket version. On me, not many of the darker notes (pepper, incense, ebony) come through very strongly; it's just light, terracotta-pink, pillowy soft yet never cloying, all around. That gorgeous dusty-pinkish-red of Mughal palaces and Indian cotton prints. They named it well and made a scent with similar beauty.  The drawback - sillage is over-shy, and longevity's not amazing (as with the rest of this series on me), though sprayed on with the abandon it deserves, it'll survive up to 6-7h as a faint but gorgeous aura on the body. Sadly not much longer on fabrics, my usual tactic for lovely heartbreakers like this. Reasonably priced IF your skin lets it endure."", 'Superbly crafted bitter incense with lashings of aromatic pepper. Delightful spice market mix which stays top end all the way through, this never seems to ""bottom out"" to base notes, they all come through together at once from start to finish. It\'r rather like opening the door to your favourite vintage/hippie store with spiky spices, incense and old furs all clamouring for attention at once. It doesn\'t project far from the skin, and doesn\'t have the longest longevity in the world, but, wow! I got fairly bored with incenses (and I love incense) until this came along.

And I realized that you should not wait 20 years for something you love... not only because you should get the things you like, and not settle for less, but also because you change and things change in respect to you and to time. I am not as overwhelmed with this perfume as I used to be, just as I won't be overwhelmed with a shirt I used to love 20 years ago. Not everything is a classic.  Having said that, I still like it very much, it has the signature CDG incense scent, and it reminds me now a lot of Yogi Tea (especially the strong scents it used to produce in the past... when I was still a student in Amsterdam...)."", 'Great scent this was my staple but the spice wore me out after a while.

Gone in an hour. And this from the company that was capable of making their ‚Äú2‚Äù scent one of the biggest beast-mode bruisers ever.  But still, the scent itself is so nice: the incense is never church-like (big plus), but rather nicely spiced with cinnamon, cloves, cardamom and cedar. There‚Äôs also a pleasant synthetic undercurrent which gives everything a slight spark and brightness. I so wish this could be relaunched in triple the strength.

Enjoy!', ""Could it be that people who don't smell spices and only smell pine sap got this mixed up with Avignon or zagorsk? To me this scent is extremely spicy with cardamom and cinnamon and some clear your nostrils strong herbal incense then rich balsamic woods. I am a woman with a low skin temperature and don't sweat so this perfume lasts me for half the day and lingers on my clothes for days after, so I am very careful not to apply more than two or three sprays max. This is the most well blended and balanced scent of the four, Kyoto is a bit too tannic and dry and Avignon is very overpoweringly one dimensional, the Moroccan one is a bit nondescript, but this scent is both spiritual and earthly at the same time.

Of course most will go for Avignon if they are searching for an incense scent and are new to these types, but most vets will at least sample this and take it for what it is worth.', 'This is a light, warm and pleasant scent, but it is also very austere. If you demand sweetness in your perfumes, this is not for you. The opening notes are extremely heavily dominated by pinesap and woodiness, and they soften over time to something milder and perhaps more incense-like.  It is nothing like as heavy as many scents that are described as ""incense"", maybe because of the blessed absence of patchouli. Personally I do not find this a spicy fragrance at all, and it certainly doesn\'t smell like my idea of India; it is far too simple, linear and restrained.  Genuinely unisex, but also sadly short-lived.', 'smells like really strong masala tea.', ""Speaking solely about the smell, for me, this is one of the nicest perfumes ever. Like, if Indian marketplace really smells this way, I'll have to move to India someday.  It has that trademark incense note of CdG and, especially, Series 3, but, other than that, there's a whole new world around. The incense backbone is surrounded by an abundance of spices in the opening - mostly cardamom and pepper, but with a dash of cinnamon as well, and later there is a fine mixture of ebony and oriental resins as well. This simplified picture, though, can't describe how divine the smell is, through the top, heart and base notes, all the time. Unfortunately, the longevity is abysmal on my skin. I can't get more than an hour or two out of this one, and that's really a shame. It also doesn't project well while it's present, and that doesn't help either. To make things even worse, this is as wearable and as unique as any CdG, so that just makes all this more sad.  This is an one-of-a-kind smell, aura and atmosphere but, unfortunately, with very, very short life.  10/10 for the smell 7/10 for the perfume"", ""Upon first sniff I'm hit with a direct reminder of a certain candy: atomic fireballs. Those round, red, spicy, candies that were reasonably popular in the early '90s. They were spicy almost to the point of novelty. Anyway, it's surely the cinnamon and red hot chilly pepper in Jaisalmer's opening that brings back this memory. And quite a spicy opening it is indeed. Too much for my taste, but a general fan of spicy fragrances should be really pleased with this one. I enjoy it more when the spice starts to calm. More akin to a colorful Indian spice market than a Hindu temple, Jaisalmer almost becomes edible as it softens up, and the cardamom is really a beautiful addition. Unfortunately by that point it's nothing more than a faint whisper, as Jaisalmer's longevity is simply abysmal on my skin. It's a shame that the scent is gone before it has a chance to really develop, because this is probably the most wearable and most uplifting of the entire incense series. Perhaps it works better on clothing."", 'Jaisalmer is another brilliant incense creation from Comme des Garcons. This one is incense-spicy-woody composition.

It makes me wanna test it more :)"", 'Purchased on Lucky scent and received today. It is just truly beautiful. You get pencil shavings (cedar) and cinnamon. It is wonderful. I can wear this all year. Sample it first, but you will love it.', 'Smelling the members of the Comme des Gar√ßons Incense series blind is an excellent way to come to terms with the reality that the human capacity for scent discrimination is highly relative. It is very difficult even to figure out which of these perfumes is which except in side-by-side comparisons. Why? Because they all smell like incense, of course! There are lots of incense perfumes around, and this set of sleekly packaged blends includes some of the best. In the case of Jaisalmer, I am struck immediately by the fresh tree scent. No fir trees or conifers or any evergreens are listed in the note pyramid, but my very first impression is of that sort of tree. Other reviewers (including a perfumer) have identified the responsible ingredient as ""pine sap"". That sounds right to me, though I cannot claim ever to have smelled neat pine sap! The overall effect is very church-y, notwithstanding the intention to evoke the atmosphere of hinduism. I\'m unclear as to what hinduism would smell like, given the tenets of that religion, but maybe there is a sense of the mysticism of nature here? Or perhaps the point here is to promote ecumenicalism, and that\'s why there is so much overlap between the various members of this series?', 'What\'s interesting here is that this ""Hindu"" fragrance smells just like Russian Orthodox incense. I say so because it has benzoin in it, which is a major component of Russian Orthodox incense; powdered frankincense and benzoin make up the base, and other oils are added to it. In fact, Hermitage of the Holy Cross sells an incense called ""Old Church"" that smells exactly like Jaisalmer.  This is a great fragrance, and it\'s definitely the crowd-pleaser of the CdG incense series. Although I consider Avignon and Zagorsk more interesting and unique, this one is more likely to appeal to the toiling masses.', 'The first time around, I found this to be the best balanced, and least of an ""outlier"" among the incense series. (Hopefully that doesn\'t mean boring). It\'s more of a straightforward, sweet wood in the top notes, with just a hint of spice to begin with, but that will grow. Cinnamon like in Maharadjah starts to appear pretty quickly, and gets very strong but doesn\'t completely overshadow the initial wood note, something that I find happens too often in spicy wood scents. The spices here are very ""warm"", or even hot, but it\'s not spicy in terms of burning or being peppery. It has the garam masala spice blend of chai tea, but in spite of the ""incense"" label, it blends them almost solely with wood, not with smoke. I honestly prefer this, when I consider how Tea for Two is almost ruined for me by too much smokiness. Later the ardent fire of the spices cools down, and the smooth, middle-of-the-road sweet wood returns, and it ends up resembling Sequoia somewhat, but with a more polished rather than raw wood aspect. There\'s still enough creamy sandalwood along with that slight crayon-waxiness to show that it\'s Indian-inspired, but like Ouarzazate it\'s not over-the-top, not trying too hard to be exotic. Another balanced, sophisticated winner from the Incense series!', ""Great scent this one...reminds me of lots of things but I still can't quite place what? It's a spicy and oriental, right out of the gate the cardamom and dry pepper are there with a clean pure incense which feels somehow cleansing. Something slightly tiger balmy in the opening but settles to a very subtle scent. 2 down 3 to go and the series is a total hit with me so far let's hope one of the next ones I try is an absolute knockout!"", ""Yum! Fresh cedar shavings with a sweet and spicy edge. I know cedar isn't in the notes listed, but like others who mentioned pencil shavings, this smells to me like fresh, sweet, shaved cedar. It is such a gentle, natural sweetness, not a knock-you-down, rich, heavy sweetness. The cinnamon is a beautiful pairing for the cedar. It's as though you can't tell where the wood ends and the cinnamon begins. I'm not sure about the cardamom, but I guess that could be part of that sweet quality too. The frag evaporated so quickly it was kind of hard to spot all its elements before it was gone. Like others, I was a bit sad that this had a life of about 10 minutes if that. You'd need to dump a cupful right over your head for this to be more than a moment's pleasure."", ""It's definitely smoky, and right now I am getting pine scent from this perfume. It smells neither stereotypically masculine or feminine, and I like that.  Smells good, but maybe I didn't dab enough on, because I feel the scent itself is a bit weak. I think this also might go well if layered with a scent with clary-sage or lime."", ""I didn't like it. The pine note on my skin had a strong dill edge, freshly cut dill. This was so dominant I could not get any other notes. After this faded away, I don't know how to put it, but what I got was some very chemical and nasty smell like some anti-insect poison. Seemed weird to me. I don't recommend a blind buy."", 'I agree with samuel.martin.1 that this is a lot like masala chai. On me it starts out more like the dry tea leaves and spices before brewing, then the dry down mellows to a chai latte. On me, the dry down smells kind of like Tibetan Mountain Temple by Pacifica, but more peppery. Delicious!', 'The most compliemented scent I\'ve ever owned. I cannot detect any artificiall, chemical note in Jaisalmer, it smells of fresh sweet sweat, like if it was a product of my body. Or I wish it was... The natural feeling of being in ""my own skin"", only better. And it DOES NOT include any cumin :) The final impression is not ""churchy"" at all, but a bit oriental due to spices. A sort of gourmand incense, delicious and calm...', 'This smells like a homemade CHai latte, I still prefer Kyoto but I could wear this in the fall or on a warm winer day. If you love the smell of a fresh Chai tea give it a try. 7/10', 'I found this very long lasting even more so than Kyoto or Avignon, I prefer Kyoto but this is more versatile. It smells like high quality Indian masala incense to me.', ""It has a touch of mystery, a touch of moss, outdoors, swamps... Something in it makes me think about vetiver some time after the application? Perhaps not, but some wonderful incense burning, dry, soft, like a lovely aura embracing me delightfully. It developes beautifully. I love the earthy warmness, with those spice and incense facets and Orient. This fragrance has a great character, I'm so tired with those fragrances for women - fortunately there are some exceptions, my all time favorite being Balenciaga Talisman, for special occasions. Jaisalmer is for everyday."", ""The CdG Incense series have a problem with this whole line. They've done a sensational job of replicating various incenses but they've done it quite literally. To me, this is a failure for perfume because while the chemist in me admires turning birch tar into leather, the artist in me needs evocation as much as replication.  Everyone has commented on the pininess of this scent. I see the connection but I think this is actually the ebony. I find this deficient in spice and the pepper missing. My summary: a neat magician's trick but not much of a perfume. Sillage: fairly close 1-3 ft Duration: 3 hours and counting Fabulosity: He's a lumberjack and he's okay Value to Price ratio: poor 2/10 as a perfume; 9/10 as a special effect"", 'Resinous, peppery and piney. Smells like a very old book. The weakest one in the incense series.', ""As others have mentioned, this has a very strong pine note at the opening, that lasts for at least 30 minutes. In fact, it's so loud that it smothers pretty much anything else for a while. And then it fades away (never completely though) and the incense shines trough. And how it shines! It's calming, warming, comforting AND not the least bit churchy. While I love Avignon, I find it hard to wear because of the strong churchy connotations; no such fear with Jaisalmer. This is not a meditating fragrance like Avignon or Kyoto, this is an incense to wear when out clubbing. IMO, it's the most wearable of the Incense series (along with Quarzazate but that lacks any lasting power). The spices (cardammon & pepper) warm this up, making it perfect for colder weather. In fact, I find this much more 'flamboyant' than Encens Flamboyant which I also own and although I like to layer my incense scents with other perfumes, I think is too rich to need any 'embelishment'.  After 4 samples, I finally invested in a FB and I can see myself wearing it quite often. A must try for incense lovers!"", ""Really nice, warm, spicy incense with strong notes of cinnamon, clove, pepper, and some kind of a pine-y woody note. It's like a strong spiced tea perfect in autumn and wintertime. I like this one alot."", 'A rich incense opening! But not the kind of incense that we can find in Avignon, where mixed with myrrh gives us a church feeling.  Here we have a incense note accompanied by spicy notes like cardamon upon a resinous base where benzoin shines. A very versatile incense based fragrance if I may say.', ""I adore incense-based fragrances although it wasn't a scent I was familiar with until I dated one man that was a meditation fanatic, and then after that, a man who sees himself as one of those new-age hippies. I had tried Heeley's Cardinal and Comme Des Garcons Avignon, both of them being rather similar, and believed that I had experienced everything that an incense-based fragrance could possibly achieve. I have since found Jaisalmer which has taken my love of incense to new heights. I agree with Scorpiosheep that this fragrance is not so 'churchy'. It's more resinous, like the sweet, smokey scent of burning wood in a pine forest. It tends to smell very masculine, however on my skin it turns quite feminine and sensual. Delightfully mysterious actually. The cinnamon is fairly heavy in the opening, as is the pepper which together create an interesting, spicy blend. The woodsy notes are strong contenders through to the heart where Jaisalmer gives me that outdoorsy type of sensation. Like wandering through the wilderness and not knowing what you'll discover. This fragrance is indeed pungent, so I spray with caution and allow it to settle before leaving the house. Too much could easily be offensive, however I do believe compliments will be in order when I next wear this in public. The longevity is extremely good, as reviewers have previously mentioned. I think Jaisalmer is one of those fragrances that will either be loved or hated. For those that like incense, amber, cinnamon, pepper or pine, or all of them combined, Jaisalmer is sure to impress. I'll just re-instate for those men looking at this page, wondering why it's listed for women, do keep in mind that Jaisalmer is intended to be unisex."", 'Initially Jaisalmer is a dry and austere balsamic incense loaded with fresh pine sap.

A couple of hours into the drydown, I imagine that I smell a little patchouli, but it may have been left over from something I was working with earlier. The scent remains mostly linear, just the lovely warm pine balsam that reminds me of the rosin that‚Äôs used on violin bows.

If you say both in one sentence - I\'ll be hooked up =) I remember sampling CDG Avignon and Zagorsk at the store, trying to decide which one I want, but somewhere at the back of my mind it screamed ""Too much church! Are you 100% sure you\'ll be wearing this?"" And then my hand reached for the bottle standing nearby, which happened to be Jaisalmer, and ...oh! This was it, I found it! Yes, this one is full of masculine tones, but somehow I love it, and some time after the application and settles to become very cozy. Many incense fragrances are often accompanied by patchouli, which I don\'t always appreciate. This fragrance, deprived of dreadful patchouli and rounded up by amber, woods and spices, has development and lasts very long, and I love it in cold winter weather. I guess, it\'s my favourite among the CDG Incense series))', 'Exactly like burning incense, including the sharp woody edge. Really not a perfume scent, but extremely atmospheric. Recommended for incense fragrance aficionados.', ""Very spicy incense which makes me think of an oriental marketplace.

However, if you are seeking the calm/meditative state and comfort that many associate with incense -- while avoiding any potential complaints about your fragrance from co-workers -- Jaisalmer may be perfect for you. Upon first spray, I definitely noticed a tart ""red berry"" note with a discreet dusting of cinnamon. Before long, the cedar made an appearance -- it smelled very similar to a small cedar ""treasure chest"" I\'d picked up as a vacation souvenir as a child. (This was a welcome development, as perfumes with cedar listed as a note sometimes turn sour on my skin... I was glad to find one that truly smelled like cedar wood!) It felt warm, inviting, and alive. The overall impression was one of a cedar chest in which spices had once been stored. I found myself liking it, even though I had originally started out in search of a power perfume that screamed ""smoky incense!!"" (This isn\'t that. It whispers, and it isn\'t smoky.) It didn\'t remind me of incense, per se, but that may simply be the result of my culture and life experiences. Yours may differ. (Maybe this *is* what incense smells like in this city. If so... I want to visit!) As for projection and longevity... both are minimal. (If I had to make a direct comparison between completely unrelated perfumes based solely on longevity and projection, I\'d say... Jaisalmer is ""less than 4711"" minimal. And 4711 is pretty close-sitting and short-lived... so, you get the idea.) Jaisalmer flies under the radar of most people. This is the type of perfume you wear for yourself. In my experience, no one will smell this on you unless they are within hugging distance (though this did result in compliments, so that\'s a plus). It does require frequent reapplication -- and that makes me wear it less often than I\'d like to, given the cost of the fragrance -- but if you like it and it resonates with you, it\'s worth having in your collection.', ""Adding to my collection of Comme des Gar√ßons fragrances, Jaisalmer is the second of Series 3: Incense I have bought (Avignon being the first, duh). Jaisalmer is a beautiful warm piquant fragrance with clear notes of cinnamon, pine, and cardamom. As it dries down, you get a constant throb of pepper and wood. It's as if you're walking into a South-East Asian spice market and perusing through all the different jars of spices. It does lean more on the sweeter side than other spicier fragrances, but it is by no means saccharine.  Overall it is really just such a pretty scent and I don't tire of smelling it on me, much like the rest of Series 3: Incense. It's also a very flexible unisex scent, being able to be worn throughout the day and into the evening.  Th only downside is its projection and longevity. Jaisalmer's sillage is mediocre at best and that's after a very liberal spraying. It's longevity is weak, lasting at most a couple of hours on my skin.

Olivia Giacobetti blends the most beautiful perfumes- this rose is lightly candied and fresh, not overtly mature, and is backed with just enough saffron and perhaps a touch of cumin to give it depth and an earthy quality I find addictive. I was so thrilled to find a brand new full bottle while visiting Milan after months of searching online.', ""My bottle is a BEAST. I think everyone here sums it up pretty well.

Its candied sweetness peaks in the initial spray, and the scent becomes more nuanced as it settles on the skin. The heat of the skin reveals its dimension - sweet vanilla and sheer rose, harmoniously blended with saffron, ginger, and a subtle cumin aspect. These soft spices and a smooth sandalwood linger deep into the dry down, resulting in a well-balanced, feminine scent with a seductive touch. Safran Troublant is a perfect representation of perfumer Olivia Giacobetti‚Äôs iconic style: evocative, atmospheric, and refined.

Does anyone have a bottle they would like to sell? Based in US.', 'Olivia Giacobetti\'s compositions are transportive and beguiling. They do not demand your attention. I liken them to ambient music. She could very well be the Brian Eno or Harold Budd of perfumers. The levels are never turned up to 11, and while quiet, her works are by no means weak. After all, returning to the music analogy, is quiet music any less real and valid than propulsive rhythms and loud rock? Evaluating fragrance on whether it is ""noticed"" is much like evaluating art by the lowest common denominator. ""My favorite musician has reached number 1 on Billboard 10 times, and yours barely cracked the top 40."" The false corollary follows that the former is inherently superior. Rather daft thinking, in my humble opinion, but all too common. Safran Troublant opens with saffron realism and at this point I frankly don\'t care how she did it because I want to get lost in the story. It\'s that heavenly smell of stigmas, carotenoid-rich threads, macerated at the bottom of mortar by a pestle. There\'s nothing else like it, and Giacobetti captures it here. It soon smooths over within a vanilla cloud, sprinkled with sugar, doused with rose and underpinned by sandalwood. Simple as that, and simply beautiful it is: a harmony of all elements. I feel happy that autumn is fast approaching as I wear this. While it makes for a pretty-sounding name, I am not sure why it\'s called ""troublant"" as it has quite the opposite effect, it soothes rather than seduces, like a hot cup of tea or a hug from a friend. It\'s a hug to perfumers from Olivia.', 'I\'m wearing this after a hiatus of a couple years. My, how hyperventilatingly sweet this fragrance is! It has a beautiful saffron note, plus an edge of ginger up top. There is a metric fuckton of a ""sugar accord"" which makes this cloyingly sweet in hot weather.

My experience is with the gold cap, orangish label one.  Safran Troublant has everything going for it. It's an impeccable display of saffron, done in a very approachable way. The spikey heat of ginger is just tame enough. Gentle red roses peek through, like a flirty wink. Vanilla and sandalwood, always a reliable pair, especially when spices are involved. It has just the right amount of sweetness . It smells middle-eastern dessert inspired, so good you could almost eat it.  The ingredients /accords must have been so meticulously placed because each part works in total harmony with the next. There's nothing put of tune or off-beat, and none of the notes outweigh the others. It's not fully rose, or vanilla or woody - It's all of those things in equal proportions with a good dose of spice. I consider it a masterpiece.  I've worn about 150 ml over the last seven years and I still adore it. It's a perfect 10/10. It lasts and projects exactly how I want it to, always makes me warm and happy inside, and I've yet to smell anything like it. The thing is, I've worn it so much that I don't currently reach for it as often as I used to. I can tend to get a little bored with it if I'm honest, but that's only because I'm very familiar with it and it doesn't surprise me anymore. Regardless, I can't stress enough what a beauty it truly is.  Anyone looking for spicy vanilla should check it out. It's slightly unusual - not weird, but could have been had it not been so perfectly balanced. It does seem to be pretty mass appealing as evidenced by the countless times I was told how great I smelled when I wore it to work, out shopping, with family etc. It's a great introduction to niche, and just an amazing fragrance overall. I assume the black bottles are of the same quality, or very close as I've not heard the usual complaints that come after a house rebrands. You could not ask for a more perfect winter fragrance imo, specifically if you like spicy vanillas. It's less a rose fragrance and more a warming concoction of spices, vanilla, sandalwood and some sweetness laced with rose."", 'An enjoyable, subtle, spicy, warm drink, like a chai, with half a spoon of sweetness and a generous dash of milk to make it smooth (it does not smell like milk). There is no unpleasantness, no shouting, no demands. It is refined, elegant but informal, inoffensive, the opposite of celebrity fragrances.  I agree that it sits close.  For the self-possessed and happy, a warm smile.', ""Ce parfum est une belle d√©couverte que j'ai toujours beaucoup de plaisir √† porter, il reste discret et manque de tenue mais il est beau, solaire, original et affiche un certain caract√®re sans en rajouter. A essayer si vous n'√™tes pas des adeptes du sucr√© et des parfums lourds."", 'The strangest thing happened with Safran Troublant. When I received it, I was underwhelmed because all I could smell was an alcoholic rose which disappeared within 30 minutes. I sprayed and sprayed, on clothing and in my hair, and the result would be invariably the same. Until a few months ago, when I tried it again and, a few hours after I applied it, I was wondering where the sweet, creamy and delicate fragrance surrounding me was coming from - it was Safran Troublant! Some days it can last up to 6 hours, on other days it disappears and comes back. As for the scent itself, it‚Äôs been said before that it is a truly delightful balmy rose with sugar and mild spices, a unique and comforting concoction.', 'The truest saffron centered fragrance I have ever had the pleasure of encountering. Yes, its true that the longevity and silage are abysmal. However, I feel that certain fragrances, like this one, are meant to be worn closer to the skin as it adds to the elegance of the composition. As for the fragrance itself, the opening reminds me of the syrup used in gulab jamun, a sweet, milky, saffron infused Indian dessert. The saffron stays throughout the wear and is quickly followed by a subtle rose note. Thus far, I do not detect any obvious lactonic qualities. The vanilla, while there, is not the main player. This fragrance is all about saffron.', 'The opening is fruity, but the rose, powdery but fresh, takes the main role. It\'s a delightful floral scent, constructed on a heart of rose, with a milky accent.  Comforting, elegant. It\'s a sheer juice, easy to wear and transparent. Like many other L\'Artisans, it is quite fleeting and has a low staying power (on my skin eating skin).  It\'s a very tamed, cozy fragrance.  Hence, i don\'t get the name ""troublant"", which meaning is disturbing, unsettling but also seducing. I don\'t see it as a seductive fragrance, rather nice and cozy yes. Nice to sample, but nothing to die for.', 'To me, Safran Troublant smells creamy, opaque, and edible. Dense but pillowy. There‚Äôs a confection I remember from childhood, something like a ‚Äúcream fudge,‚Äù but not as sweet as American fudge. I imagine Safran Troublant as a delicate, saffron-and-rose-water-imbued cream fudge. I am less likely to wear it out than just for myself -- especially when I‚Äôm tired and unmotivated, it‚Äôs a welcome, energizing distraction and fortification, a soothing pick-me-up.', 'Seeing the notes i was very wary. I was traumatized by Baccarat Rouge in terms of the saffron/sugar couple. But this was a nice fresh surprise ! Safran Troublant bears great similarities with Nishane‚Äôs Suede & Saffron, add the textured vanilla. The rose is not very prominent and neither is the sugar. Vanilla only smoothens the dryness of the saffron but it‚Äôs not a creamy perfume, nor is it ambery. Problem with L‚ÄôArtisan Parfumeur is the weak/mild performance ... Regardless, this is a good but average saffron, unisex and inoffensive. Pleasant, just not a head turner.', 'Delicious, sweet-but-not-saccharine, warmly spicy gourmand. As mentioned by others, a truly seamless blend that makes you want to get closer. My winter go-to. Great for snuggling!', 'I got this today as an addition to my rose collection. It is a gourmand perfume which starts out with a blast of spicy saffron. Some reviewers have said it smells earthy or like sweat. This I suspect is cumin which seems the most pronounced note on opening, giving a strong oriental vibe. However quite quickly the spiciness melds with a deep rose and the sweatiness dissipates. Vanilla becomes pronounced, joining the rose and spice. The notes seem to blend into a dessert of sweet rosy spice which is just delectable. It reminds me a bit of Indian rice pudding - so lovely. This remains unchanged for a long time and wears very close and warm. I am wearing it in summer and it is not overwhelming, but I imagine it would be comforting in winter too. I love it. If you are put off by the initial cumin blast, just wait a little bit to be beguiled by something much more tender and wearable. My only slight disappointment is that the rose is not as prominent as I would have hoped. It is more of an instrumentalist in an orchestra rather than the diva soloist. However the perfume is divine.', 'This is one of my favorite perfumes ever. This has a distinct rose note, but there is something salty and buttery about it. It smells like what salty skin tastes like, if that makes any sense. I don‚Äôt get savory notes and it does not tread in the Serge Lutens territory of using aromatic spices (EG, cumin, corridander, and white pepper) to ‚Äúdirty‚Äù up the fragrances. Instead this is a much creamer saltier ‚Äúlived in‚Äù fragrance. This sits close to the body and blends in with your body.', 'Clean, soft, comforting. A good scent to start or end the day with. Does not send a strong message, just gives you a sense a peaceful well being.', ""A very unique, beautiful scent. The beginning starts off with sharp saffron. It's spicy and a bit dirty, almost like B.O.! It then smudges out beautifully over the next few minutes and hours into a creamy sweet-spicy aroma, like saffron rice pudding. It's a very comforting and cozy scent. The rose is blended in well, adding structure and complimenting the tang of the saffron, while the sandalwood adds woody sweetness to the base. Definitely more of a spicy gourmand, not overly sweet. Works well for all genders. Sillage is low and the scent sticks close to the body, making this the perfect scent for cooler days with layers wrapped around you bringing up wafts of Safran Troublant periodically."", ""Wow this is such a unique scent! It captures the smell of saffron rice dish very well. For me it's mostly a spice forward fragrance, and I detect very little florals. In the deep dry down, it gets sweeter and more candied. This is a very lovely scent, very cozy, while being unique!"", ""I get a lot of the earthy elements of saffron in here, and as a result I don't love this fragrance as much as I was hoping to. I was also expecting more gourmand sweetness, but for me the earthy, dirty saffron dominates everything, with rose in the background. Below average sillage too."", 'On me this only works in warm or hot weather, which brings out the rose so that the other notes only serve to make her lovelier. (In cold weather, the saffron ""pong"" takes over.) I wouldn\'t have expected to enjoy something this warm and sweet in the heat, and I\'m not usually a fan of such rose-forward fragrances, but this is subtly delicious. (My sample was from one of the older, gold-cap bottles.)', 'This is the exact scent of sugared, milky eggnog! Sadly I don‚Äôt get any rose in this but the saffron is noticeable. Nice sheer, gourmand scent but the longevity is non-existent. I like to put it on before bed. It‚Äôs so light that it can be worn in any weather. In a similar vein to Tea for Two, but I prefer that because it has a little more heft.', 'My first bottle of Safran Troublant I will treasure for ever. Because my husband bought this for me in the L‚ÄôArtisan shop in Paris, just before Christmas and it was sooooooo romantic. AND because they changed it and the newer batch is not as good. The old bottle has the gold cap and it smells much deeper than the new one. Such a shame. Nevertheless: It is still one of my BIG scent favourites. It‚Äôs really my go-to perfume in autumn and winter when I want to be wrapped up in spice and warmth. It lasts for days, it‚Äôs very grown-up and solid. It is saffron all the way, but leans more towards amber and rose than towards a savoury or leathery scent. And that‚Äôs how it stays, maybe it gets a little more vanilla as it dries down. It is one of the best warm scents out there.', 'This fragrance is an art. It smells great and reminds me of delicious gourmet Turkish Delight with pure rose flavor. Sweet but not cloying or overpowering. Magical!', ""I'm wearing it now, and I must say it's not exactly what I expected.  Its opening reminds me of 1969 from Histoires de  Parfum a few hours into its development. Intensely spicy, almost masculine with a strong cardamum note, in addition to the titular saffron.  It evolves into an airy and dry concoction. The rose is absolutely not the protagonist here, the spices are far more prominent. Sandalwood gives it a very pleasant lightness and keeps the vanilla and spices from becoming too cloying.  I will say I'm missing some acidity from the rose, but that is probably cause I haven't had time to live with this perfume and appreciate it for what it is: a light, woody spice that is intensely unisex."", 'The soft and feminine way to wear a spicy fragrance. Oh, how I love this! The opening is very close to real saffron, warm and spicy, not as medicinal as it can sometimes be in perfumes. But you can already smell the sweet roses and vanilla underneath it. This is a wonderfully creamy and milky kind of scent, the rose is jammy in a way, but not heavy, maybe like a transparent rose jelly. The sugar note is like a veil of powdered sugar that lies over the spiced vanilla in the drydown, it‚Äôs not cloying.  Safran Troublant is relatively simple and easy to wear, good to comfort yourself on cold fall and winter days, but it isn‚Äòt boring. I read the complaints about lasting power, and I know that this is generally a problem with L‚ÄòArtisan for some people, but all I can say is that I own several of their fragrances and never felt like they vanish too quickly. This is a soft scent though, but for me there are more times and places where I‚Äôd rather smell like a delicate rose and saffron dessert than like I rolled through a spice rack. And if I want that effect, I bring out my Kenzo Jungle instead. Despite this being categorized as a unisex scent, I feel very feminine and romantic in it, as it‚Äòs sweet and rosy and also rounded and natural, without any hard edges. But of course I wouldn‚Äòt want to tell any guy that he shouldn‚Äòt wear it, it‚Äôs just the opposite of the typical male-marketed spice fragrance.', ""I thought I'd already done a review on Safran Troublant, but guess I missed it. So, here goes. I love this scent! Cream saffron and what I smell as cardamom (though I don't see cardamom in the notes specifically, so it is probably the ginger) are 2 of my very favorite spices and they translate beautifully into this perfume. The rose and ginger add a bit of sharper spice and the vanilla and sandalwood smooth it all out. Not too many ingredients, but they are all so perfectly blended into a soft, comforting, slightly Indian Kheer smell that I absolutely adore. The only issue I have is that the longevity is so short. That said, I bought it anyway and will just enjoy it as long as I can."", 'Just like the tree, this scent exudes balance, growth and harmony. Inspired by the sound of wind blowing through the trees, finding a waterfall through the woods, and grounding yourself in nature. Safran and spicy notes mix with a slightly sweet vainilla touch. Surprising and original.', ""+ This is quite lovely. It's soft spicy ginger, and has a softly powdery cosmetic quality probably from the saffron/sandalwood combo... all while not being overly sweet. It's light, airy, and feminine on my skin. Dries down dry and powdery. Inoffensive. Future buy list. Very light and fleeting. Very intimate scent cloud. You cannot overspray this. For the delicately scented among us.  EDIT Sept 2020 - Back in stock! I bought it, finally. It has arrived and I love it even more than the sample. I'm excited for it to age and mature in my collection. Happy today! I love it so much I just might buy a backup bottle."", 'The closest thing in my collection I can compare this to, is Serge Lutens Jeau de Peau. The warm sweet milkiness is in both. This one with a soft spice, SLJdP is more sweet & ""foodier"". This one is also lighter. I\'m gonna spray myself down with it, but I have a feeling, it could never overpower. If you do like this & you do not mind the sweet foodie thing, SLJDP is still not an overbearing fragrance, but it\'s def louder with a better throw than this one. This is VERY safe. I\'m a HUGE L\'Artisan fan, Juice & bottles tho, so I had to have it! I do wish they were all a tad stronger and had better longevity. IMO opinion, the Rose is not in the back seat, it\'s in the trunk in this one.', ""A fluffy delight. The spices are gentle. Ginger and saffron are prominent and the sweetness is soft. It is worthy of being a staple for rose, spice, sandalwood lovers during the cooler months because while it is cozy it's also a bit zingy. It really enhances my mood on a gloomy day, it feels like the sun is peeking through the clouds. The color of the juice is a good representation of the feelings it evokes. It's a linear composition & wears closely. It's easy to wear while also being unique enough that it doesn't smell like anything else. Just a lovable sugared ginger, rose, saffron, sandalwood, vanilla scent! Longevity is a little sad as with most L'Artisans but I don't mind. The scent makes up for lack of staying power for me."", ""It was a blind buy and my first L'Artisan fragrance, but at ¬£40 I couldn't say no to a bargain! I've just worn it this afternoon, so I'm getting to know how this juice will evolve and it's quite promising. Starts with a spicy and in the face saffron, earthy and kind of zesty. But the blast is short lived, in about ten minutes it evolves into a creamy, sweet but not too much syropy notes lingering about. Thereafter, all I can detect is cardamom and I love cardamom too. I would say it's a pleasant cr√®me brul√© scent, which is the opposite of my taste for oriental-woody fragrances, chypre or fougere. Will update after a few days."", ""Hmmm. Like but not a love. Look, I'm very picky and somewhat unforgiving if I don't like even a single note so keep that in mind while reading this. At least I admit it!  I love vanilla and really like saffron. Couldn't find this to test locally so I took a chance. Overall, I do like this and the saffron is very nice, especially mixing with the vanilla in the dry down. I'm not much on the opening though. It's a bit too floral for my tastes. The opening leans too far into women's fragrance and isn't really unisex. That's okay for many people but a bit unpleasant for me. However, after that it's very nice. On me, longevity isn't an issue (@5-6 hours) but it sits close to my skin and doesn't project all that great. Yet, it is still strong on my skin (up close) even after 5 hours. Does describing this as a strong skin scent (on me) make sense? Overall? 6.5/10 So I don't regret buying this at all.  As far as a men's (unisex) fragrance goes, it's rather unique from what I've found. The saffron note is the star, it's done very well, and not found featured often (at least not so far in my searches) in a fragrance that men can wear. Yet, even though it's labeled as unisex, I think this is kind of inaccurate and it's more for women. I do believe women will like this more and be more comfortable with it than males. I think that rose note amps up the floral aspect and tips the scales towards females. Then again, that could be my own personal discomfort with florals talking. Still like that saffron note mixed with the vanilla though in the dry down."", 'One of my absolute favourites it‚Äôs so warm and sweet and comforting. Like relaxing into a bag of golden rose sweets. Really enjoying it on the bright sunny autumnal days we‚Äôve been having and also to bed. Will be needing a full bottle of this it‚Äôs in my all time top 10.', ""For me, this is a gourmand! Saffron rice. This is straight-up smells like food to me. I've liked saffron as a personal fragrance in other perfumes, but this one is just too much like flavored rice for me."", ""A very beautiful light floral. A little old fashioned, in a classic way. I can imagine people of all ages enjoying this but would best suit 35+ due to its effortless confidence. I get hints of tobacco in the base along with a soft and sweet rose and vanilla. Unlike many fragrances from this line, this does last a long time on the skin and has fairly decent silage. I blind bought this but unfortunately it is too similar to La Dandy which I already have. I am selling on Ebay UK as I just don't see myself reaching for this enough."", 'A scent so insistent and persistent and seductive that it slowly, gently, firmly crushes any of my reservations about it.  Yes, maybe it\'s several spoonfuls sweeter overall than I would like, but the saffron punch is really detectable and manages to last for a surprisingly long time - longer than in other leather/saffron or neroli/saffron mixes I\'ve tried, while looking for a partner which can make this lovely spice sing on my skin. This one really does - and the sweetness also gets around the problem of saffron sometimes going earthy/bitter, as well as extending its life.  Yes, it collapses ever so slightly into a powdery-pale-pink rose phase, which is not my sort of thing at ALL, yet the spice keeps pulsing away steadily inside, so the rose seems organic and natural and real rather than tipping into robo-feminine or plastic-Barbie territory.  Yes, it really really does smell like payasam, or kheer, or other milky-spicy South Indian sweets, though without overwhelming cardamom (which is a good trick as cardamom often plays a lot rougher than other things and overpowers them) and never allowing the sweetness to become cloying or sickly. Reminded me in some ways of Kenzo Jungle L\'Elephant without the shouty mango note. Yes it\'s soft and almost dusty, so gentle it could be twee, but it manages to snuggle without smothering.  Anyone should wear anything they want, but to me this is a predominantly feminine rather than unisex perfume; in its gentler moments it wafts almost towards a ""kind grandma"" sort of scent, but never ever seems fusty or \'old fashioned\' - just gentle and wonderful. So much better than I was worried it might be. And with more-than-respectable longevity too. A genuine saffron victory.', 'I wish I was into bellydancing just so I could get decked out in that kind of garb and wear this while performing.', 'Young Woman in a Yellow Dress (Madame Modot) by Amedeo Modigliani 1918', ""When I'm dead and gone I would like to think that my grandchildren remembered that she wore her hair very long, even past her sixties, and that a hug from her smelled delicious, expensive, unlike any other Grandma."", ""What a lovely fragrance. It has a similar quality to Five O'Clock au Gingembre - that of cosiness. A great scent to wear to curl up by the fire and eat ginger biscuits. On me, I get a great blast of saffron to start, mingled with a very fresh rose, very light like a rosewater. After a few minutes there's the merest hint of fresh ginger as if a scent wafted in from the kitchen. And then very quickly the drydown, which smells exactly like the sugary white chocolate mix I make at home (mainly vanilla). I love Giacobetti's scents, but heck, this is elusive - it's a skin scent inside half an hour, though having reached this phase, it then lasts for hours. Glad I bought a 100ml bottle, as it will need reapplying often, but its quiet throw makes it, like the Carons, a great fragrance to wear to dinner. Very glad I have this - it's a most unusual fragrance journey. These days I often wear it layered over Calligraphy Saffron, which anchors it and makes it last longer."", 'If you love Safran - you must try this one! fantaboulus! Safran, Rose, Sandalwood and I guess the spicy note comes from the mix of safran/wood/ginger. Totally unisex and great. Very longlasting and with gooood projection. My skin usually ""eats"" parfum but this one I can still smell after 15 hour.  OM du √§lskar Saffran - s√• m√•ste du testa denna! Helt otrolig mix av Saffran, Ros, Sandeltr√§ och jag gissar att den kryddiga tonen kommer fr√•n mixen av Saffran/Tr√§/Ingef√§ra. Helt unisex och underbar. Otroligt h√•llbar och med en rej√§l utstr√•lning. Min hud ""√§ter"" parfym men denna doftar fortfarande efter 15 timmar.', ""TO DIE FOR. I freakin' love this one...this stuff is no joke. It's a creamy/milky candied saffron with a hint of rose water in the background. Doesn't have the best lasting power on me, I'd say I get 3-4 hours with soft sillage. I'll often layer this with Molecule 01 which adds a cedar/woody note and a couple extra hours of lasting power. Although it's sort of light I'd say it's a cold weather, fall and winter, scent in my opinion."", ""Very simple perfume. This perfume don't have any scent change in its scent pyramid. If you used niche brand before, you have detected that the most niche perfumes have some changes in their notes during timeline and some of them are so complex, but this one is so simple. Just saffron and rose and nothing else.  I become so surprised from Mr. Duchaufour's perfume. He is one of the best perfumers in the world, but this perfume is too simple for a niche perfume.

Initially, this smelled quite harsh and spicy as the saffron and ginger are very powerful. Then the magic occurred and I got wafts of the most delightful rich, creamy and spicy fragrance, underpinned by unobtrusive sandalwood and vanilla. I don't get any floral notes at all. Sillage is very close and this is - on me, anyway - poor from the outset and a skin scent within 45 minutes. I have a decant (thank you for this, Alex Planet_X) and the spray is very over-enthusiastic! However, as the fragrance seemed to calm down very quickly, I added another two sprays to each forearm. Out of interest, I also sprayed some on my pyjama top and THIS is where I can pick up the body odour smell to which some reviewers refer, although it isn't overwhelming. The scent does not seem to develop or change on clothing, which is unfortunate. Some two hours later, the scent has all but disappeared from my skin, unless I breathe warm air onto it and then inhale immediately.  Although I LOVE this fragrance, I know that I will have to re-spray every two hours and will get through an entire bottle very quickly. This is one of the worst performances of any perfume I have tried; the other is ID Parfums Siam Flamboyant, which I tried earlier today. However, 60ml of SF is currently retailing on eBay for less than ¬£10 GBP including P&P. 100ml of Safran Troublant is well over ¬£60 GBP +.  I know Safran Troublant is an EDT, but at this price point, the sillage and longevity are shockingly poor.  This is very disappointing - and I can see from reading previous reviews that my experience is not unique."", ""Nice offering, but don't last. Smells just like the safflower oil, a very common herbal extracted drug for external use in asian countries, with subtle rose nuance.  Quite linear, and even not sophisticated enough, but I just love it in almost every expects except its poor longevity. Longevity: less than 3 hrs on my skin with subtle projection in the first 30mins or so.Rating: 7.5/10"", ""Beautiful, unique and ethereal creation signed by Olivia Giacobetti for L'Artisan (not Bertrand Duchaufour, who's credited here on Fragrantica). I mostly get rose, vanilla, saffron, ginger and sandalwood. A little gourmand but not overly so. It strikes me as elegant and quiet, even when applied generously. It's a scent that one truly wears for themselves because others aren't likely to notice it unless they're extremely close to you. If you prefer big, radiant, sillage monsters, this isn't for you because it doesn't shout across the room. It's a scented whisper. I've been wearing this quite a bit (it's currently summer here in Paris) and even on the hottest days, it's never too much. It just creates a beautiful halo of scent around me.  One of the five fragrances I'd rush to save if the house caught fire. There's nothing else quite like it."", 'This was a blind buy for me from L\'Artisan Parfumeur. I didn\'t have any doubts about loving it, since this cross references with several of my previous favorites on fragrantica database, but was apprehensive on how it would work with my skin chemistry. Would I get the saffron and rose I want, or only vanilla, as some people here seem to have gotten? Fortunately, for me, this works amazingly! Saffron comes through in the best way possible. Crisp rose, too, initially, but it all blends to a beautiful, soft and not at all offensive gourmand blend in about an hour from the application. It also lasts longer on me than people report, but this seems to be a common occurance for L\'Artisan Parfumeur brand in colder, drier climates, with a dryish skintype people here tend to have.  And, for the record, new L\'Artisan Parfumeur box for this fragrance closes the ""created by"" discussion that has been going on at many sites. It clearly states this is a Olivia Giacobetti creation, not a Bernard Duchafour as this site still states. So, if maintainance is reading, maybe it\'s time to change this?', ""Gosh, this is a beautiful fragrance but sadly so weak and short lived on me. I immediately get rose, saffron and then vanilla. What an inspired combination. Very feminine and I think seductive. I cant stop sniffing my wrist. I might just have to forgive the poor longevity because its so beautiful. I do seem to love BD's creations. The addition of the ginger with the sandalwood really make this perfect. The ginger gives a little kick to really enhance the other notes. Is it my imagination or does this smell similar to Guerlains L'instant edp? It smells like a slightly sweeter version. I recommend everyone should tries this as its just too lovely not to experience just once."", 'This is stunning! I can see this being a great SPICY perfume for the heat. It\'s definitely saffron, but really sheer after the dry down. I definitely see purchasing this in the future. Thank you ""ThisVulture"" for the glorious sample! My PFF ;)', ""Safran Troublant is warm, soft, intimate, beautifully blended, and feminine. It's one of those fragrances that when I wear it people lean in for a closer sniff. I enjoy its calming, comforting and sophisticated presence."", ""Interesting how differently can perfume behave on two skins. I bought this for myself longing for saffron scent. When sniffing the cap it was like opening the jar of dried saffron, but on my skin it was all about creamy spicy rose, very feminine with saffron buried somewhere deeply under. Creaminess reminded me of Lanvin Oxygene and rose accord of Perles de Lalique. Before giving it away I offered spritz to my wife and that was completely different story. Beautiful realistic saffron accord like when dried saffron is thrown to a warm arborio rice. No detectable rose at all. I wish I had her skin. So the bottle goes on her shelf instead.

It was sweet but in a mild, comforting way. The vanilla was whisper soft and the spices blended so that it didn't scream saffron, and wasn't foody. I recently got another sample and wow, definitely different! Now it seems more like just a spicy saffron, like a cooking smell almost. The soft vanilla was still there, but the overall impression was not as soft as before (about 6 years ago). I'm not a saffron fan, but I loved the way it smelled the first time I tried it.

EDIT: As much as I love this scent the longevity is not great :( I'm still glad I bought it but am happier that I got it for ¬£29.99/100ml from Tk Maxx, I wouldn't be overly happy if I had paid full price for 30 mins to an hour max wear, such a shame."", 'I really thought I\'d like ""Safran Troublant"", but it wasn\'t my thing at all. The rose jumped out immediately with a matronly body-cream quality, floating on top of a watery, caramel-like sweetness that reminded me of burnt custard. It\'s ultra feminine, boring and unrefined to my nose. Had to sell it.', 'Safran Troublant opens with a cloud of saffron mixed with sweet and sour fruity notes and bits of coumarin. I smell passion fruit (not passion flower). Then, some vanillin notes start to linger through, together with a hint of woodiness. Rose is up next. The rose is quite subtle on me, but grows in intensity as the saffron disappears. The drydown is a sweet and sour rose on a vanillin soft sandalwood base with a hint of saffron.  Sillage is moderate, longevity weak to moderate.  I love the sweet and sour opening. Despite the coumarin, the scent stays soft and almost powdery even. I am not a fan of rose scents but this one is different-- the rose supports the other notes quite well. I like the different layers of the scent, the cold vanillin, the warm rose and the sweet sour fruity notes that bind it all together. And the saffron is wonderful.', 'This lasted hours on me. Granted, if you\'re more than 5 ft away from me, you\'re probably not going to smell it. However, I have nothing like this in my collection! And, it\'s very yummy! Dessert from another exotic world. It\'s milky, spicy (middle eastern spice) and a little sweet from the sandalwood. Mostly, SAFFRON! Awesome! :-) It\'s not something I particularly love usually, but this is very enjoyable. I definitely know what another reviewer meant by saying this smells like ""body odor"" (I promise didn\'t turn or go bad); there is a distinct BO quality but we all know not all body odor is bad!! We\'re human after all and we like how we smell! It still smells gorgeous and yummy! And it only smells that way if you smell it an inch away and that\'s not how perfume is smelt usually...', 'The top note of SAFRAN TROUBLANT is a very strong, metallic saffron...and I wasn\'t too keen on it. . . But, while I was contemplating who I could give this bottle to, the saffron began to mellow and warm and mingle with a sweet, gingered rose. Eventually, the saffron shed most of the rose and combined with the vanilla, ginger and sandlewood to, curiously, create a very warm ""arroz con leche"" (rice pudding) scent.  To me, this frag smells just like my mother\'s warm, creamy ""arroz con leche"" with a liberal sprinkling of nutmeg. On my skin, there is a very pleasant warm milk smell that I really enjoy. Yet, I wouldn\'t classify this scent as sweet, rather I find this scent is best described as warm, creamy and animallic. The saffron releases a ""dirtiness"" that makes this EDT sexy, romantic and multi-dimensional.  SAFRAN TROUBLANT lasts a good 4-6 hours on me and radiates within arms\' length. Definitely a unisex fragrance that can easily be enjoyed all year because it is not so heavy that it should only be used in colder months. It is warm, yet light, and very enjoyable.', ""Very impressed scent-wise. Terribly disappointed about its longevity  On me this is a soft warm scent with lots of saffron and ginger. A natural sweet nuances akin to the smell of raw sugar wafts in and out alongside a subdued vanilla fragrance. During the dry down I could smell a transparent sandalwood note that is so soft it's always on the verge of vanishing. No rose. But I'm perfectly fine with that.  I especially adore Safran Troublant for its versatility. This is a scent that can be worn and enjoyed alone or paired with clean florals to give them depth and warmth. I've paired it with soft notes like tea and neroli that can be easily overpowered, and each time the combination turned out fabulous.  But it only lasts 2 hours or less on me, and my skin generally holds on to perfumes well! For that exact reason I won't purchase it."", 'I purchased this on the strength of a decant. My first impression was not great. Seriously, I adore saffron, but straight from the nozzle, this stuff smelled real coppery, like blood, sweet, sickly, metallic and decidedly ""butcherish"". Anyway, undaunted (you have to admire my persistence), I applied some FSW Bollywood to my other arm just in case at some point in the day I needed a serious nose rescue. I could mention here that FSW Bollywood has saffron in it, which was the main driving force which sent me toward the Safran Troublant. From beneath my heavy english winter coat, something rather lovely began to drift nosewards. Something soft, sweet, and delicious. Like the loveliest milky saffron pudding. It smelled like 1970s ice cream, the kind you got in the middle of Count Dracula\'s Deadly Secret ice lollies. I was actually salivating. I checked the FSW arm. No, it wasn\'t coming from there, I checked the Safran arm. You know those moments when something smells or tastes so good, your eyes kinda roll back and you are yanked back to reality by the soft drip, drip of saliva falling onto your handbag? Yes, it was one of those moments. I got my son to check (he has an amazing nose), and I had to wrestle my arm free from him, as he didn\'t seem to be in any hurry to part with it, it was like trying to steal a bone form a particularly hungry hound. Verdict? Blood. Then sandalwood, roses, then the big finish of sweet saffron & vanilla milk pudding, or seventies ice cream. So ... I\'m doing the ""Google is your friend"" thing, and happen upon the following article on cumin (which I have oft opined smells like a chap\'s armpits), which mentions saffron...... ""I just had to throw this in here, since I was on the subject of cumin and man-sweat and I was sort of tight-roping sex. I\'ve tinctured saffron. Just a smidge cuz that\'s all I need. Saffron isn\'t one of those smells that makes you all squishy inside and ask questions. It\'s interesting. Foody, of course. Stains the hell out of whatever it\'s mixed with. I read somewhere, can\'t recall where exactly (age creates these memory lapses . . . ), that women in ancient times would blend saffron paste with rose oil and apply it to their nipples for their lovers\' pleasure. The theory is that the nipple sniffer becomes extremely excited and gives the old girl a healthy toss before passing out next to her, his bright orange nose glowing in the darkness. So now I\'m off to find an acceptable rose oil. And then . . . well, that\'s none of your business."" ~ Justine Crane, Oh True Apothecary.

There‚Äôs a comforting sweetness to it, though not at all sugary or syrupy or cloying. A bedtime ritual beginning with custardy spoonfuls of sandalwood pudding and vanilla bean cream, a lukewarm bath infused with a concoction of milky musk and delicate pink rosewater, and a marvelously grounding, magically enveloping hug. You‚Äôll sleep the soundest and deepest of sleeps, and you will be visited by the loveliest midsummer dreams.', ""Safran Troublant is a lovely, natural safran at first, but after a few hours it starts to smell more and more like an old person who hasn't been showering for a while. It's a note that's supposed to smell spicy but for me it doesn't work. The strange thing is that after maybe 7 hours the sweaty note has pretty much disappeared and the perfume is more like it was in the opening: the safran is there with a hint of vanilla."", ""1. Grease a 12x15 inch pan. 2. In a medium-size pot, combine sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup, evaporated milk, whipping cream, and butter.

Transfer mixture to the prepared pan and let the mixture cool completely. When cooled cut the Carmel into small squares and wrap them in wax paper for storage. There you have a very simple recipe that I found online for vanilla caramels. I've been thinking about it all day, and wondering if it would be possible to add some saffron to the mix, because the rich scent of Safran Troublant reminds me of a really good caramel-but the saffron, while strongest at first application, holds true for hours, so now I want caramel + saffron.  This perfume is very nearly linear to me. As I said, the initial strong blast of saffron fades, but it never disappears entirely, just combines beautifully with sugar and ginger to make a perfectly glorious treat."", 'One sniff and there was no doubt I love this perfume.That was almost 10 years ago.

This one opens up with bitter sweet saffron (almost gastronomically) and spicy cardamom (which is not listed) in the blend of creamy sandalwood and sweet vanilla. It has moderate projection and longevity on my skin.', ""Love. It is love.  I smelled it for the first time today, and my limbic brain went into ecstatic overdrive. I could not think anymore. I just kept on smelling my arm, and mumbling incoherent one syllable sounds. And I walked out of the store with a 100ml bottle, which set me off by about CAD$ 168. Totally unplanned and completely compulsive. Back home, I sprayed generously and I am now, officially, in olfactory paradise.  So, how does Safran Troublant smell like? There definitely is saffron, but that is only part of the story. While saffron remains at the centre stage throughout, it is gorgeously enveloped in softness, with a hint of rose and ginger. I presume that the vanilla and sandalwood are responsible for that incredibly aerial softness but, really, in truth I cannot pick out the specific notes. And yes, rose and ginger can be sometimes overwhelming, but that is not the case here. They simply provide a bit more depth.  All notes are so magnificently blended that I have the feeling I just found the perfect masterpiece. That said, as noted by others, sillage and longevity are below average. I like close to the skin scents, so poor sillage is a non-issue for me. As for longevity, that's a bit of a shame."", ""I tried this just on paper and I loved it!! The main note I can perceive is saffron, but it it warmed by by rose (which isn't so strong or predominant) and vanilla (which I can't smell as vanilla but more like a warm spicy note).

I love them, especially the smell of saffron. Wearing a perfume that smells like those buns was not my cup of tea, I like the smell but it has no dimension.  I could smell the saffron scent for about 2-3 hours, the perfume it self was rather boring imo. I didn¬¥t find anything exotic or interesting by the smell of just saffron. I¬¥t didnt smell nor vanilla nor powder just saffron in a bitter way.  I am a fan of gourmand fragrances, but I expect more of them then just the smell of pure saffron. I prefer 8 88 by Comme des Garcons that has a much more subtile smell of saffron and a dimension to it.', 'This scent enchanted and captivated me ... Warm safran, oriental vanila, spice, elegant. I not expected that will be till so kind, so good. Ideal on summer time and the winter.', ""Imagine a saffron rose that blossoms in the torrid heat of a desert sun, nourished with cloves and cut ginger.

An oriental rose with both sweetness and spice, so breathtakingly balanced and beautiful. The perfect choice if you want to smell exotic and intriguing, like thrilling adventures in faraway places."", ""This is the fragrance that started the niche game for me.  When I was fairly new to the world of perfumery about 2-3 years ago I have never really laid my nose on any niche at that time except for some Creeds and such brands that are typically found in your mid-end department stores which I usually found these scents safe and disappointing for their high price tags.  When I first sniffed Safran Troublant it led me to realize there was a lot more potential in the world of niche than what your local department stores had to offer and gave me reason to continue exploring the niche perfumery even if it meant I had to do it through the internet (no niche stores around my area). What I liked about Safran Troublant was that it was something completely different from anything else i've smelled at the time, it came off as a little daring yet with quality. However, after 2 more years of sniffing around and building the knowledge that I now have about perfumery, I think there are better options than Safran Troublant in the niche market that can do almost the same thing but better, especially in terms of longivity. For example, the spice and the rose in Safran Troublant reminds me a lot of Rose 31, except later on Rose 31 has a nice dry down whereas Safran Troublant doesn't really have much of a drydown due to longivity issues. Yes, as many of you point out Safran Troublant does have poor longivity (this is L'Artisan we're talking about), but personally for me it's not a problem because Safran Troublant is more of a comfort scent to me more than anything else and I like my comfort scents to have low longivity because I either fall asleep in them or later on in the day I like to spray on something else."", 'I got a sample and tried it as I like saffron but instead it smelled like sweat/body odor.

I'm very much looking forward to sniff number two."", ""This starts out with a fantastic sweet and dusky saffron note, the best one I've smelled. After a few minutes it's joined by a very light veil of vanilla and rose, and it's quite beautiful. About an hour in I get a faint trace of sandalwood behind the vanilla, but by this time it has faded down to such a quiet scent that I can barely tell it's still there. Another 30 minutes and it's basically gone from my wrist. Sigh--I wish I didn't love this perfume, because it disappears in the blink of an eye...."", 'Very light and delicate fragrance. Does have a bit of actual saffron smell to it along with vanilla and some other spices. Almost too delicate for a man in my opinion, although it is stated as unisex.', ""This was so close to amazing for me that I'm disappointed. When I first put it on I loved the strong saffron. That morphed into carnation and then disappeared in half an hour, though, and I couldn't discern the perfume at all.  Shrugged it off but then it came back rosy, which was okay-- I detest virtually all rose fragrances and this is the first one that didn't make me ill. So I toyed with it for a while in case I ever got the urge to smell like a rose. But then that disappeared and it was nothing again.  This was all last night and when I woke up this morning I had two distinct drydowns from it on two different parts of my body. My wrists smell like one-note vanilla, which is okay. The bends in my arm, however, smell wonderful, like a very faint but intriguing smoky sweet tea. If I could get that drydown everywhere I might buy this but it's too faint and ephemeral to make it FBW for me.  It had no sillage on me, but no perfume does."", ""What to say about this wonderful perfume ? Not particularly strong or longlasting, but even these two things are little to complain about when a person simply desires some calm and comforting moments. One of those things to wear for yourself right before dropping off to sleep, and one fragrance I know I'll never be without. Whether it turns out to be your cup of tea or not, different enough to deserve a sniff from any thoughtful and curious fragrance hunter."", ""a magical and sensual scent, spicy and creamy, just sweet enough to be soft & conforting, tender, and refined. This is like cocooning but in an elegant way, on an old velvet sofa, with a cachemire plaid over you, drinking a hot milk with brown sugar and spices, in fall, while it's raining outside, and some rose & vanilla candles are burning in the room... listening to some soft, lounge music."", ""Saffron--glorious threads of orange saffron! Safran Troublant smells exactly like pure saffron right out of the spice jar, but over time it becomes creamier with the added richness of vanilla and just the right touch of rose. I smell saffron all the way into the drydown.  After trying so many foodie scents like Loukhoum, Gourmandises, and Sweet Oriental Dream, I badly wanted a perfume that was not so sickeningly sweet. The sugar was too much to bear. And Ford's Noir de Noir is beautiful, but it's so dark and rich that I think of it as an evening or special occasion fragrance. It's also quite foodie with a sumptuous, creamy, French vanilla note.  Safran Troublant is the answer to my lengthy query as to whether I would ever find a true saffron perfume with just the right amount of rose that is not sweet like candy or covered in barrels of powdered sugar. To think--I almost passed on sampling this because I assumed it would be like all the others. While many people describe this perfume as gourmand (technically it is, since saffron is obviously edible and plentiful here), I guess I fail to want to eat this perfume and will instead satisfy any cravings for Turkish Delight with the likes of Loukhoum. Safran Troublant is not as strong of a perfume as I'd like, but it does last, and I do feel it was worth the price. It's great for casual wear; a breathtaking interpretation of saffron; a beautifully crafted perfume; simple but unique."", ""Most of all I feel the saffron, rose and vanilla notes in this fragrance. But I can't call any of them intensive, actually.  This fragrance smells oriental, but calm enough. Also it smells gourmand enough. Quite natural smelling fragrance.  I can't say that I like it too much, but I rather like it than don't for sure. Good fragrance!"", 'Magical and elusive.', 'Safran Troublant is a fine fragrance---assuming you like the scent of saffron, which I do---but it is fugitive. The initial impression of a true, warm saffron note is rather brief. It\'s followed by a faintly floral (I don\'t get a rose scent, only ""floral""), faintly vanilla and sandalwood scent, with a glissade of spices (cardamom, mostly) somewhere in there, and a lingering hint of that lovely saffron. As it settles into the skin, I notice mostly the vanilla scent. It\'s not sweet, which I am happy about. It\'s entirely delightful, but it\'s like time-lapse photography! If ever L\'Artisan came out with a reformulation that magically kept this exact scent profile but made it LAST long enough to enjoy, I\'d be all over that...', 'This seems like it\'s got myrrh and amber rather than vanilla. The vanilla certainly isn\'t the dry and bitter natural vanilla, as it is syrupy here, and is also a bit ""dirty"" or animalic. I like the smell but it may be lacking in dynamism, and so not really what I\'m seeking in a personal fragrance, which I want to entertain me for several hours. It\'s a bit on the heavy and dense side of things, and I\'m not sure if the notes contrast enough for me either. I don\'t get any sandalwood unless I smell it up close on the skin. Overall, it seems like an interesting attempt to merge a few different genres, but there are so few notes that it either works for you or it doesn\'t. It doesn\'t seem like the kind of fragrance you can try again in a month and discover something new. I don\'t feel any reason to sample it again any time soon, but if and when I do I\'ll update here. This review is for the old style bottle, not the one pictured above (I don\'t know if that matters). And ""red rose?"" Not unless my nose is ""broken."" My guess is that it should read ""rock rose,"" because that would explain the animalic quality I detect (I get no floral rose), but perhaps there was a reformulation (I have the original style bottle).', 'Well, thank you Olivia Giacobetti..! I definitely adore Safran Troublant. What a beauty, perfect for at least three seasons. Not too light and very bright. Reminds me of Dolce Vita, but spicier. On my must-buy-a-bottle-of-this-soon list !!', 'It was created by Olivia Giacobetti!', 'This scent is amazing. I\'ve always said my ideal scent would be one that imitated my favorite Indian dessert, payasam. Payasam (also known as kheer) is basically rice or wheat or noodles boiled in milk with lots of sugar, cardamom, and saffron, and it\'s basically the most delicious thing ever.  I\'ve searched high and low for a scent that would mimic the smell of payasam or authentic Indian chai tea (which is almost always made with cardamom rather than cinnamon/anise/what have you). Unfortunately, most of the scents I\'ve tried so far, both niche and mainstream, pair cardamom with very masculine woody scents or savory/borderline sweaty spices, and they almost always go very light on the saffron. I don\'t want to smell like an Asian marketplace, damn it; I want to smell like the desserts they\'re peddling there! Safran Troublant is a miraculous exception. [Edit: see below.] ST smells almost identical to payasam and a bevy of other Indian sweets made with saffron, cardamom, and milk, but also pairs that delicious edible scent with the lightest touch of rose, more close to rosewater than fresh roses themselves. This, ladies and gentlemen, is a gourmand done right. Safran Troublant leaves your skin smelling mouthwatering yet not ""foody""; it\'s sweet without being cloying; and, most importantly of all, it\'s so perfectly blended and smooth. It carefully balances between food and floral, and it skillfully bypasses that icky sensation foody perfumes sometimes create - feeling like you\'ve spilled a bunch of food down your front. I feel like I\'m floating in a bath in a pool of cream, saffron, and spices. And it feels damn good. Update: Okay, upon slathering this on a bit stronger, a sharp cumin note stands out. Eeek! It does fade a bit after a while, but it\'s still there enough to make me feel nervous (I\'m sort of hypersensitive to cumin-y scents). I guess it\'s back to the drawing board.', ""Safran Troublant is a precise balance of Sensual Girlishness and Esoteric Asceticism, The earthy Rose note Is a Willowy Young Hippie with her long fair Wisps Around her Pale lightly freckled face With her Diaphanous Batik Gown of all different colors and a  Suede Southwestern style Hat with Turquoise Stones, Walking in a familiar rhythmic motion, removed of thought or feeling like her soul been ascended from a  another plane, The Rose note represents The innocent  Wanderer for an unquenchable Thirst for Knowledge. Sweet  with an Tinge of Patchouli begins our Journey, Walking around in the Ashrams the Warm Winds of Saffron Pierced her Senses brought her to Consciousnesses Then from the corner of her Pewter Colored eye is a Sadhu Staring into space without time  nor age piercing Black eyes Yellow Red and black Pigment on his meditative face and a Saffron Colored  Cloth covered the Background, Wisps of Incense smoke  Intoxicated the Moment even further couldn't keep her  fixation on this Holy man. Safran Troublant Conjure Passion and Spirituality vast Like the Epic Mahabharata and the devotional love Of Rama And Sita of the Ramayana, S.T Brings the Ancient into the Modern."", 'Rose and saffron? Holy moly! I\'m in love. This fragrance is unbelievably easy to wear. Saffron is just such so soothing to me. Although it is beautiful...It is a bit too soft for me. I wore it the summer I was separating from my daughter\'s father and I swear, it has aromatherapeutic powers. It made me feel comfortable and secure at one of the most difficult times in my life. Now, I\'d like to revisit it. The only thing I\'m thinking is I may be ready at this point for it to have more of a ""kick."" I\'m not as tender as I once was.', ""This is such a soft, delicate fragrance - the saffron is absolutely beautiful (I love saffron though). I can't stop smelling my wrist when I wear this! In addition to the saffron is rice, vanilla, cinnamon, and something sweet...(I make it sound like rice pudding but it's not exactly that). it's truly unusual and enticing. The problem is, it does not last AT ALL. it is gone so quickly after I apply it that I could never justify buying a bottle :-("", ""L'Artisan Parfumeur SAFRAN TROUBLANT definitely has a hefty dose of saffron, so much so that it strikes me as more of a culinary than an oriental perfume! One of my favorite comfort foods is actually saffron rice, and SAFRAN TROUBLANT captures the scent in a bottle, so I cannot agree that this is troubling at all! I love, love, love the smell of saffron rice (I usually make it with basmati)--and also the taste. But I'm definitely in Mellyhelly's camp on SAFRAN TROUBLANT: it won't work as a perfume for me because of the utter familiarity of the scent. (I'll have to try her recipe and use arborio next time...) I can imagine that for people who are unfamiliar with this delicious scent, SAFRAN TROUBLANT would seem exotic and unique. I love it, I do, but I would not want to smell like saffron rice."", ""I won't deny its beauty, but the problem with Safran Troublant, as I smell it: I once had a candle (or perhaps it was some potpourri) that smelled EXACTLY like this. True, it was a good-quality, expensive, department-store candle or potpourri, but an environmental scent nonetheless.  Safran Troublant is a spicy floral that's perfectly suitable for men or women, as long as you won't be offended when someone asks who is burning a Yankee candle when you're in their presence.  As others have noted (and as I have heard is generally the case with L'Artisan scents), poof! It's gone in a couple hours."", 'I finally got a full bottle of this wonderful scent and I am sooo pleased with it. Its my first venture into the  Gourmand category of fragrances. I love this smooth, sensuously  light and spicy scent. The Saffron infusion ...added to a rich and unique mixture of flower notes and my favorite base ... Vanilla!!!! Its a gourmand scent, and although it may sound like a ""Plate of Paella""... its very .... Uni-Sex in my book... I cant stop smelling my wrist .... and can\'t wait to wear this out and see what the response is from friends and strangers. UP Date Oct7 2010: My only compliant: Non lasting and fleeting! the fragrance isn\'t long lasting .. and I find myself spraying it over and over....to recapture its ethereal magic.', ""I know Safran Troublant since its release, I was so curious! I expected a vibrant spicy oriental scent, instead all I could smell is saffron with some vanilla and not long lasting. It's a very nice smell for smell's sake. I have a friend who wears it and she's happy with it, but for me it's a no no for wearing because it strongly reminds me of typical Milanese risotto! It feels like going around after a bath into saffron rice! Very nice and a good smell, but definetely too foody and culturally affected for me!"", ""I totally agree with most of the comments here. Safran Troublant is unique, warm, spicy and delicious. Very good for cold winter nights when you wish you were curled up with your loved one by a fireplace surrounded by candles drinking hot gluhwein. Surprisingly, I don't find it too dominant or overpowering, just an elegant and uplifting scent to make heads turn as you walk by without annoying people who get nauseated by strong scents. I love it, and as winter is on its way, I am definitely considering to buy a bottle."", 'I am have been holding off my review on this perfume for a time now. Safran Troublant feels to me like an olfactory peep into my soul and I feel so shy about talking about it. But this is such a masterpiece it would be an injustice to keep it to myself.  Safran Troublant is, as expected, a fragrant ode to saffron. Upon opening, every single time the inital heady rush of golden saffron paralyses my mind and all I can feel is my heart beating a little faster with excitement. It is like being suspended in time and space and feeling all your hopes at once.  The first time I wore this, the transition from the opening to the creamy sweet saffron-infused base actually brought tears to my eyes. Ever since then though, it has simply brought me peace and a gentle humming in my body. Depending on my mood, it can also make me a feel sweetly melancholy. Troublant indeed!  As it really settles, it seems like the fragrance oozes from my pores, as if I really *am* Safran Troublant.  This is the kind of fragrance that would make me extremely jealous to smell on anyone else. I love it beyond reason or sensibility.  The issue of lengevity is very real. One second it is there and the next I am desperately hoovering my skin with my nose, trying to recover my lost treasure.  Ultimately it is understandable though, how can such an etheral heavenly gift really be captured for long?  On second thoughts, that is probably why God invented purse atomisers.', ""Very beautiful. Original, light oriental, spicy, creamy, fluffy, warm, sensuous and sexy too - for all of those ten minutes that I can smell it. Unfortunately this doesn't last on me at all! Since I seem to be the only one to experience this here, I must put it down to my skin chemistry - but this fragrance somehow completely disappears after a very brief moment."", ""I'm wondering if those who love this also love cinnamon, clove and nutmeg. I suspect that if you are not a fan of these spices, this wouldn't work for you. In general this genre is difficult for me to wear; scents tend to turn too discordant and unpleasant on my skin.  But if this is your genres, Safran Troublant will be a pleasant, enveloping surprise that will wear like sunshine."", 'I just love the spiciness of saffron in perfumes - another fave of mine with a distinctive saffron note is Agent Provocateur but it is quite different from Safran Troublant. The latter is a gorgeous oriental - warm, sensual and luxurious with soft and cuddly vanilla drydown but I just wish it was a bit stronger and longer lasting. Saffron can be smelled from beginning to end, at least on my skin, and is absolutely addictive. I would definitely like to keep a bottle for my collection as I truly appreciate its character and originality.', 'I love it soooooo much...... My favourit of the last year.', ""Oooh, the notes.. Saffran Troublant is a very pleasing although lacking intensity. I need more of this stuff! So yummy kinda fragrance! Lasting power is about few hours, but that's not enough! I too agree, one of the best, but I think every L'Artisan I tried are very best and special. I love how passionflower sounds with saffron, although I think there's more passionflower than saffron. But it doesn't spoil the day, it's gorgeous! Later it becomes more spicy and I can detect vanilla. Very worth trying if you don't know what to pick. Lasting power is good (eight hours on me), but it's too much close to skin. Dry-down is vanilla and passionflower."", ""Sweet rice pudding?? Creamy milk?? I would spend a whole week's wage on any perfume that has those scents in it, so LUCKY i only bought a sample of this. I can't smell either of those things - Im so upset! This is like a light fresh spice scent. The opening smells like saffron with hint of lemon zest to it. That dies down and the other notes are all there in pretty equal measure, and the one thing i really like is that the rose here is not powdery and old fashioned smelling, like a lot of roses seem to be, to my nose anyway. The whole thing is very light and subtle, I had to put my nose right to my wrist to be able to smell this. I think I can see what others are referring to as a sweet creamy-milky smell, its the vanilla and rose that gently lift the saffron to make this smell like a subtle indian rice pudding, but for me at least, all the notes are so subtle that I could only just make them out. I don't know if this fits my definition of sexy, but its definitely unique and pretty in it's own way. I doubt I'd buy the FB."", 'With the first spray i was ecstatic! Saffron! How i adore the scent of saffron. I use it in my cooking and have been longing for a perfume that smells mostly of saffron. However, as it began to dry down it began to smell like carnation. Yes, i know, i don\'t see carnation among the fragrance notes, but that\'s how it smelled on me. I like carnation, but that wasn\'t want i was looking for. Saffron was still there, but fading away. Gradually the vanilla began come forward, so i smelled carnation and vanilla, with mere hints of saffron. Sigh. I was hoping for stronger saffron - or perhaps my nose just stopped smelling it. In any case, it will be good for summer and, i think, autumn... well, and probably winter, too, as it is warm and spicy, but delicate. Ah, the search for more saffron perfume will continue, but i suspect this will be the, uh, ""saffronest"". -- Addition 19 May -- As i said above, i continue to wear ""Safran Troublant"", and i find the more i wear it, the more i become sensitive to smelling to the scents in it. I no longer smell ""carnation"". Now i smell a dash of rose, followed by strong saffron when i first put it on. Additionally, i smell saffron from first application to full dry down. I think perhaps i didn\'t put enough on the first time i tried it. It still has a lot of vanilla, but i am coming to love this more and more... Perhaps it will be ""my signature"" this year. Mmm-mmm-mmm, saffron. This *is* the ""saffron-est"".', ""Fairy, fine, ambiguous, with many notes composite like symphony, but in it can be heard rather piano, not forte. Piquant, oriental, warm, elegant, but not ostentatious. First smell after perfume Mitsouko, which ideally adjust for me. Because Safran Troblant has something from soul and character ‚Äì Mitsouko - liberty, individuality. If compare to beautiful arts ‚Äì this are masterly draw brush paints: red, golden, brown, yellow, white. This smell doesn't intrude. Appetite, spurring ‚Äì saffron, rose, wanilia, probably muscat, creates fine, intriguing mixture. Great congratulations for Olivia Giacobetti! - she is author (not Bertrand Duchaufour )this modern and magic composition, dignified legendary parfum Mitsouko.I love parfums L'Artisan, but specially I love Safran Troublant."", ""I can remember one of the first articles I ever read regarding perfume - one of the many 'What your perfume says about you' ones, with particular attention as to what you possibly enjoyed doing on the basis of the perfume you wore.  I was an Angel devotee at the time - and although the vanilla wasn't foremost for me, the article quite rightly had it that I was a foodie who enjoyed cooking and getting people together over food. It seems I can't escape my fate! Safran Troublant is my latest, very special perfume of choice - it's warm, slightly spicy, sweet and definitely evocative of its namesake. Imagine being wrapped in a rich, fragrant cloud of orange yellow and you're half way there. One downside to the perfume - the tester bottle that I tried from in the first place lasted for hours. I have found that I don't get nearly so much wear from the bottle I purchased. I'd be interested to find if anyone else has found the same?"", ""In Sweden the most common use for saffron is in a kind of buns that we bakes during december to celebrate Lucia and Christmas, in my family it is a christmas tradition to bake the buns together with my kids some days before Lucia (13th december). Otherwise saffron is use for that special french fishsoup... So I was a bit skeptical at first when it comes to saffron in a perfume, I don¬¥t want to go around smelling like saffron buns.  But I don¬¥t. Safran Troublant is a gorgeus perfume. One of the best of the L'Artisan`s perfume I¬¥ve tried this far. If the colour orange was a fragrance it could smell like this. Warm, aromatic and quite sexy too. It makes me think of light candels, sheer shiffonscarfs and bubble bath. A perfect fragrance to wrap you in with in november and december when the weather is rainy and grey (at least in Sweden).  If you are unsure about rosefragrances, you should try this because it dosn¬¥t remind me of any other fragrance with rose that I have tested. The same goes for the safron, if you are skeptical (like me) still give it a try, I am sure you will enjoy this.  I was about to buy a big bottle of Dzing! and I maybe will, but now I think I must have a big bottle of this one to.  A must must must try!"", ""TO DIE FOR. I freakin' love this one...this stuff is no joke. It's a creamy/milky candied saffron with a hint of rose water in the background. Doesn't have the best lasting power on me, I'd say I get 3-4 hours with soft sillage. I'll often layer this with Molecule 01 which adds a cedar/woody note and a couple extra hours of lasting power. Although it's sort of light I'd say it's a cold weather, fall and winter, scent in my opinion."", 'If you love Safran - you must try this one! fantaboulus! Safran, Rose, Sandalwood and I guess the spicy note comes from the mix of safran/wood/ginger. Totally unisex and great. Very longlasting and with gooood projection. My skin usually ""eats"" parfum but this one I can still smell after 15 hour.  OM du √§lskar Saffran - s√• m√•ste du testa denna! Helt otrolig mix av Saffran, Ros, Sandeltr√§ och jag gissar att den kryddiga tonen kommer fr√•n mixen av Saffran/Tr√§/Ingef√§ra. Helt unisex och underbar. Otroligt h√•llbar och med en rej√§l utstr√•lning. Min hud ""√§ter"" parfym men denna doftar fortfarande efter 15 timmar.', ""What a lovely fragrance. It has a similar quality to Five O'Clock au Gingembre - that of cosiness. A great scent to wear to curl up by the fire and eat ginger biscuits. On me, I get a great blast of saffron to start, mingled with a very fresh rose, very light like a rosewater. After a few minutes there's the merest hint of fresh ginger as if a scent wafted in from the kitchen. And then very quickly the drydown, which smells exactly like the sugary white chocolate mix I make at home (mainly vanilla). I love Giacobetti's scents, but heck, this is elusive - it's a skin scent inside half an hour, though having reached this phase, it then lasts for hours. Glad I bought a 100ml bottle, as it will need reapplying often, but its quiet throw makes it, like the Carons, a great fragrance to wear to dinner. Very glad I have this - it's a most unusual fragrance journey. These days I often wear it layered over Calligraphy Saffron, which anchors it and makes it last longer."", 'The truest saffron centered fragrance I have ever had the pleasure of encountering. Yes, its true that the longevity and silage are abysmal. However, I feel that certain fragrances, like this one, are meant to be worn closer to the skin as it adds to the elegance of the composition. As for the fragrance itself, the opening reminds me of the syrup used in gulab jamun, a sweet, milky, saffron infused Indian dessert. The saffron stays throughout the wear and is quickly followed by a subtle rose note. Thus far, I do not detect any obvious lactonic qualities. The vanilla, while there, is not the main player. This fragrance is all about saffron.', ""I've never smelled the new black bottle, so I can't speak to that. My experience is with the gold cap, orangish label one.  Safran Troublant has everything going for it. It's an impeccable display of saffron, done in a very approachable way. The spikey heat of ginger is just tame enough. Gentle red roses peek through, like a flirty wink. Vanilla and sandalwood, always a reliable pair, especially when spices are involved. It has just the right amount of sweetness . It smells middle-eastern dessert inspired, so good you could almost eat it.  The ingredients /accords must have been so meticulously placed because each part works in total harmony with the next. There's nothing put of tune or off-beat, and none of the notes outweigh the others. It's not fully rose, or vanilla or woody - It's all of those things in equal proportions with a good dose of spice. I consider it a masterpiece.  I've worn about 150 ml over the last seven years and I still adore it. It's a perfect 10/10. It lasts and projects exactly how I want it to, always makes me warm and happy inside, and I've yet to smell anything like it. The thing is, I've worn it so much that I don't currently reach for it as often as I used to. I can tend to get a little bored with it if I'm honest, but that's only because I'm very familiar with it and it doesn't surprise me anymore. Regardless, I can't stress enough what a beauty it truly is.  Anyone looking for spicy vanilla should check it out. It's slightly unusual - not weird, but could have been had it not been so perfectly balanced. It does seem to be pretty mass appealing as evidenced by the countless times I was told how great I smelled when I wore it to work, out shopping, with family etc. It's a great introduction to niche, and just an amazing fragrance overall. I assume the black bottles are of the same quality, or very close as I've not heard the usual complaints that come after a house rebrands. You could not ask for a more perfect winter fragrance imo, specifically if you like spicy vanillas. It's less a rose fragrance and more a warming concoction of spices, vanilla, sandalwood and some sweetness laced with rose."", 'Around Christmans in sweden we make special christmas buns with a lots of saffron in them. I love them, especially the smell of saffron. Wearing a perfume that smells like those buns was not my cup of tea, I like the smell but it has no dimension.  I could smell the saffron scent for about 2-3 hours, the perfume it self was rather boring imo. I didn¬¥t find anything exotic or interesting by the smell of just saffron. I¬¥t didnt smell nor vanilla nor powder just saffron in a bitter way.  I am a fan of gourmand fragrances, but I expect more of them then just the smell of pure saffron. I prefer 8 88 by Comme des Garcons that has a much more subtile smell of saffron and a dimension to it.', ""Very simple perfume. This perfume don't have any scent change in its scent pyramid. If you used niche brand before, you have detected that the most niche perfumes have some changes in their notes during timeline and some of them are so complex, but this one is so simple. Just saffron and rose and nothing else.  I become so surprised from Mr. Duchaufour's perfume. He is one of the best perfumers in the world, but this perfume is too simple for a niche perfume. Both longevity and sillage is too short. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- €åŸá ÿπÿ∑ÿ± ÿÆ€åŸÑ€å ÿ≥ÿßÿØŸá Ÿà ÿßÿ®ÿ™ÿØÿß€å€å ÿßÿ≤ ÿ¢ÿ±ÿ™€åÿ≤ÿßŸÜ. ÿß€åŸÜ ÿπÿ∑ÿ± Ÿá€å⁄Ü⁄ØŸàŸÜŸá ÿ™ÿ∫€å€åÿ±ÿßÿ™ ŸÜÿ™ ŸÜÿØÿßÿ±Ÿá.

Then I stumbled upon a 50 ml bottle and blind-bought it. I'm glad I decided to take a chance on this one! It's a very realistic lavender, accentuated by other notes. Basil and vanilla are the most prominent notes besides lavender, but those are barely noticeable. This is an intentional fragrance; simple, and extremely well blended. I have a small vial of 100% lavender essential oil (ingredient for creating soap), and this smells just like a smoother version of that, which is exactly what I was looking for. I wear this around the house, after taking a warm shower in the evening, relaxing with a cup of tea, or before going to bed. Just one spray on the chest is enough to catch a whiff every once in a while. My wife is very sensitive to smells, and she never comments on this one, which is a good sign.

Love 10/10!', ""As a Sultry and Elegant Floral Symphony, Lavandula by Penhaligon's is a delightful surprise, showcasing its excellence as a scent that marries floral explosions with an evolving complexity. This eau de parfum not only performs well in both projection and longevity but also offers a sensorial journey that evolves beautifully on the skin. The initial moments after application unveil an heavenly burst of flowers and basil, creating an olfactory explosion that is nothing short of enchanting. As the fragrance settles, the amber note gradually emerges, initially intense but gracefully subsiding into subtlety over the course of the day. After approximately 5 hours, Lavandula transforms into a meadow of flowers with a hint of woody presence, evoking the serene beauty of nature. This metamorphosis highlights the dynamic nature of the fragrance, offering a multi-faceted experience that keeps the wearer engaged. Describing Lavandula's overall smell as sultry and elegant perfectly encapsulates its character. The combination of basil, pepper, cinnamon, lavender, clary sage, and lily-of-the-valley creates a sophisticated symphony that lingers on the skin with a sultry allure. If a numerical rating were to be assigned, Lavandula earns a well-deserved 8.5 out of 10. This score reflects its commendable performance, captivating scent profile, and the nuanced journey it takes the wearer on from the initial burst to the lingering meadow-like dry down. Lavandula stands as a testament to the brand's expertise in crafting fragrances that are both captivating and refined. It is an olfactory experience that unfolds gracefully, leaving an indelible impression of sultry elegance. A worthy addition to any fragrance collection, Lavandula is sure to enchant those who appreciate the artistry of perfumery."", ""Penhaligon's Lavandula takes me back to walking the lavender fields of Bleu Lavande in Magog, Quebec. The headspace of lavender under the July sun, mingled with the coumarinic warm grasses and surrounding green ambience.  It starts off with an emphasis on the herbal, agrestic qualities of lavender, evidence of a good helping of the natural essential oil. This quickly alights from the air to become softer, somewhat sweeter, soapy, with touches of amber.  This is one that serves as an aromatic nightcap, something therapeutic at night fall, to help me drift to a dreamy elsewhere. It is definitely not a punchy aromatic, fougere-esque lavender, it doesn't have a fluffy cloud that is supported by a boatload of vanilla and tonka, it is sheer, diaphanous even, meant for personal enjoyment more than as a statement. Be that as it may, it remains a delicious skin scent for many hours.

A lovely fresh fragrance I only use at home when I want to relax, maybe after a bath before going to bed. A treasure in my opinion, there are lots of lavender fragrances out there, but they all seem to get lost amongst too many other notes. Here you have it: lavender at its best, and that is what you have for the whole olfactive experience. If you want the hidden lavender, look further. I love it!', ""Blind bought it based on the reviews and my attraction to lavender scents. Unfortunately that was a big mistake.  In general I've grown to like complex, sexy (meaning vanilla and wood) fragrances these days. This one smells like lavender for 2 minutes, then turned into a strange soapy smell that is never pretty nor relaxing and definitely not sexy.  I then layered it with Mon Guerlain, to give it a little more lavender punch. It worked okay.  To summarize, sample first, do NOT blind buy."", 'Straight up lavender- not herbally enough for me', 'A lovely lavender scent- herby and soapy in a good way. Smells like a garden in the sun.

There's a richness to it, but it's still very much a spring/summer scent. There's a pepperiness that almost makes you want to scrunch your nose when you smell it directly, but then the lavender/herby-ness just mellows it out. I also get the muskiness that reminds me of a heavy spring rain. Overall a lovely smell. I think it can be worn day or night in the spring/summer, and it's most certainly unisex. The pepperiness can play up to a more masculine scent but the floral softness can also be played up to be more feminine. The dry down has a sweeter finish that's absolutely lovely. It lasted all day on my skin. Sillage is moderate. 8/10 Would recommend, especially if you like lavender"", 'Oh... How fresh. How airy, how clean, how spicy, how soft, how comforting. I love it. I really didn\'t expect to like it. I didn\'t know this was my type of scent. Everyday perfume makes me see that.. I didn\'t know myself so much..  What I think I like, and what I actually like, turn out to be so different! Almost polar opposites! How did I ever form my self image?  Perfume is a self-discovery tool. This perfume is one that uncovered yet another layer. I thought I\'d find this sort of scent ""boring"". It\'s not. It\'s so collected yes, maybe doesn\'t speak much, but it has a presence that speaks for itself. One that sees the miraculous in the ordinary, and appreciates the notes of calm.  It is like a cool dewy early morning, birds are singing, walking in an untamed garden. Everything is where it should be. There is a minty spicy yet milky quality to it that I love.  If you are looking for a fresh, herbal floral that is soft not harsh, not offensive, work appropriate, wearable for everyday, gives an impression of cleanliness and collectedness, and still manages to not be boring, this is it. Edit: after wearing it for some times, I discovered it turns dusty in the drydown...  Sorry for rushing to write an opinion before trying it out thoroughly! Funny how our experience of a perfume changes so much the more we wear it', ""What I truly love about Penhaligon's is their ability to keep thing simple while nether getting boring and without any need to add stressful complications. This is clear here, in this deceivingly simple lavender perfume that still manages to give to lavender an interesting twist.  It starts of very fresh and floral, later it becomes more soapy (but not in an unpleasant way) and I do get basil and lily of the valley. Is it similar to Caron? Well, it's lavender. But no, not at all. Cron is both fresher and sweeter. Here vanille is really only hinted at and the whole scent is much more herbal. It's also quite similar to Penhaligon's other lavender scent, Endymion, but again: different things. I prefer Lavandula, because Endymion is much more metallic.  This is a good, unisex, lavender scent with a hint of powdery soap and some herbal notes: it's hard not to like it."", 'First impressions. The opening smells 100% like natural lavender oil. In about 20 minutes, it fades out a bit, and you get this enveloping cloud of powdery softness. There is some sweetness from vanilla and/or tonka, some soft spicy notes and a clean musk, maybe even cashmeran? All in all, it smells clean and soft and homely and, dare I say, not very masculine. I\'m having Eau de L\'Occitan on my other hand, and while I have considered it to be a soft and gentle fragrance itself, it appears much more rugged, brisk and straightforward compared to Lavandula. And while I\'m trying to get sense of this fragrance, I\'m discovering that it also has something cloying going on that makes me want to stop this observation. Let it be, but no ""like"" from me.', ""It's a soft, tender and whispering lavender fragrance. It's not a beast, and it doesn't radiate much, but it lasts all day.

A lot of people are complaining about it's longevity but she'll spray this on herself in the afternoon and I'll still smell it on her well into the next morning."", ""This is a true and classic lavender cologne for me. It bursts into life before settling into a gentle walk through a field of lavender. Unfortunately, if you like a long walk, it's probably best to spray it on your clothing as well - it doesn't last very long, it's all in the initial hour or so. One tip, one spray above my pillow at bedtime made me feel calm, uplifted and helped me to sleep after an exceptionally rubbish day."", ""I love lavender, but that one is not my cup of tea.

It is indeed the Lavender fields in South of France in a bottle. But it also has a secondary and beautiful spices smell which is warm and beautiful on my skin. I can see myself wearing this for work as it's understated enough. I have half a bottle and will repurchase when it's finished. Its an absolute beauty! I have been impressed with Penhaligon's fragrances for a while but this is truly superb! EDIT: A negative - It lasts 1 hour at the most. As all Penhaligon's I've seen so far staying power is an issue. 5/10 :)"", ""If you have a supersonic nose, get this, it's beautiful. My nose couldn't find it after a short amount of time.

THAT'S!! the south of France that I adore so much! Lavender in all depth and complication full stop. Authentic, pure, true, nostalgic, deep, aromatic with beautiful dry hay undertones, caressing not only your skin, but soul and heart, evoking forgotten memories, healing and embracing. Melancholic, clever herbal-spicy concoction. I can't stop wearing it at night, as it does something amazing with my own self - I start dreaming amazing things and ....what is there L.Turin said about it?...Bet he will get into perfume hell for being so ignorant and useless with far too many failed descriptions."", 'This is a beautifully simple lavender perfume. Its one of the perfumes I feel is great for my own personal enjoyment. Great perfume', ""I have aways loved the smell of lavender.  As a child I would catch bees inside yoghurt pots and then hold them to my ear pretending them to be walkie-talkies with the trapped bees buzzing around inside. Then I would set the bees free and be left feeling dizzy from the excitement and from the powerful scent of the lavender bushes all around me. As a teenager I often bought bottles of pure essential oil of Lavender and sprinkled it on my pillows and evaporated it in oil burners.  As an adult, I have always looked for Lavender fragrances that do justice to my happy memories and that are not too 'feminine' as can often be the case with lavender based frags.  My absolute favourite is Annick Goutal's Eau de Lavande which is now sadly discontinued. I am lucky to still have a good 50ml or so and will savour that juice until my dying days. Penhaligon's Lavandula is a lovely fragrance although it took me a long while to properly appreciate it because I was so enamoured with the Annick Goutal scent.  Lavandula is a very realistic lavender yet is also something a little more. I can definitely detect a touch of cinnamon and musk and although it is not listed, I can almost detect something very close to cardamon; it is just the perfect tiny hint of dirtiness to balance the almost overpowering cleanliness of the overall composition. Lavandula is one of the purest and cleanest scents I have ever experienced, especially in the drydown. It is the scent to be worn by handsome priests or beautiful surgeons. You trust whoever is wearing this scent and fall silent with a gentle reverence."", ""I love lavandula. I've finally found a lavender fragrance that isnt too harsh and has a little warmth. I tried the Caldey Island Lavender and it was rubbish. It smelt too musky and it didnt even last an hour. Lavandula on the other hand is more true to the actual fragrance of English lavender and lasts for many hours. I grow four different types of lavender so I have a fair idea of the true lavender fragrance. The sillage is moderate. The usual gorgeous presentation and a bargain price in the sale. I'm very pleased."", ""Luca Turin is the review done wrong to Lavandula. Much easier to wear than Pour Un Homme de Caron, Penhaligon's scent is just a wondeful lavander that can be nice on both sexes. It's a tiny bit powdery, but that is not a negative aspect, it gives you a sort of feel good aura throghtout the whole day, never too dominating nor too weak, just perfect. And it's impossible to offend anyone. I like Lavandula best because of the herbal facet Caron's lacks which in my opinion makes it even more masculine than the Homme lavander. And yes, I am talking about the latest of reformulations. Thank you."", ""I love the smell of lavender and because of this i have been looking for a lavender based fragrance. So many times i have been disappointed but not this time. This is the best lavender fragrance i have ever smelled. Its an utter pleasure and i enjoy the quality of it !

Utterly disappointing.', 'While I adore the mix of notes in this fragrance, I have to agree with Weegee above. I, too, find this too strong initially. I mist the air and walk into it, or else I end up with a headache, which is a shame, b/c I love it. It is The. Best. Lavendar fragrance. How I wish they made this as EDT, or even the same strength as their gents colognes!', ""I love the top notes it's bright and soft, but then as it develops I think gets too powdery, I like it, but I'm afraid I would get sick of it after some time.I think I will stick with Yardley Lavander, much nicer for me. I notice people comparing it to Chanel Jersey and I don't smell any similarity. Jersey contain Rose and Tonka Bean and Lavandula don't, I adore Jersey and cannot stand Lavandula, they are so different."", ""Lavandula by Penhaligon's stands as a classic and timeless treasure, a fragrance that weaves an intricate tale around the authentic essence of lavender. In the world of scents, Penhaligon's emerges as a maestro, crafting the most wonderful, mysterious, and rich fragrances, and Lavandula is no exception. This fragrance is a symphony of aromatic wonders that unfolds in layers, each note meticulously chosen to enhance the true beauty of lavender. The opening introduces a dash of pepper and a hint of cinnamon, adding warmth to the basil, while allowing the pure purple flowers to shine. Lavender takes center stage, enveloping the senses in its aromatic embrace, reminiscent of alpine mountain meadows and fields near Grasse. As the heart of the fragrance unfolds, muguet and herbal sage join the aromatic journey, contributing to the smooth and refined character of Lavandula. The scent evokes the clean, soapy, and woody nuances of lavender in an elegant and proper manner. It is a true olfactory representation of the flower's intrinsic qualities, elevated to a level beyond the ordinary. The drydown is where Lavandula reveals its true mastery. Zesty spices and dry florals seamlessly blend into a smooth, sexy, and incensy composition. Amber, tonka, and vanilla contribute to an earthy, sensual allure without veering into the realm of heaviness or excessive sweetness. The scent remains grand yet unassuming, rich and interesting without overwhelming with complexity. Lavandula captures the essence of Provence fields, maintaining a slightly floral and clean profile throughout its evolution. The fragrance lingers with a hint of musk that entices without overpowering, creating an experience that is both captivating and comforting. Penhaligon's Lavandula is a testament to the brand's commitment to quality and simplicity. It stands as an elegant and amazing creation that elevates the lavender soliflore to new heights. With good sillage and average longevity, Lavandula remains a true gem in the world of fragrances, offering a journey through the aromatic wonders of lavender."", ""‚ÄûThis is the first lavender fragrance I've found that is absolutely wearable; most lavender based scents have a harsh, brash feel that may refresh with its briskness for a few moments but soon overstays its welcome. This is a soft, interesting mix of spices and florals, yet still manages to remain true to its source. The ambery-musky basenotes are subtle but adds longevity to the fragrance so it wears very well for a lavender scent. Sillage is average, a great day time scent for spring and summer. Wish it had somewhat greater longevity since I really like this one a lot."", 'My husband just purchased this fragrance for me as a Christmas gift. He has never bought me a frag before but I always have wanted him to choose something for me that he loves. I am happy to say he really nailed it with this one! It is my first Penhaligons and now I am really interested in this house. This fragranceis absolutely beautiful, so fresh and clean yet sexy at the same time. I have been wanting a lavender scent but the ones I have tried up until now have ot wowed me one bit. Kudos to my hubby on this pick. It will go in the front of my collection as I can alreadyntell this one will be in my everyday fragrance rotation!', 'This it the most refined, elegant and beautiful fragrance ever! This was a surprise gift from my husband and I love every drop of it. It is a strong fragrance and lasts forever on me!', ""this is the best perfume ever!

I was a bit nervous about ordering this having never smelled it before, but I wanted so badly to love it, and it did not disappoint. It's everything I was hoping for.  I've never owned a perfume that was based around lavender. When used in fragrance, lavender can smell really weedy and bitter. I wanted something that smelled like the actual flower, but that would remain sweet and soft. I also hoped and prayed that this would be more of an herbal & aromatic perfume, and it's just as I wished for. The opening concerned me as being a tad on the masculine side. I could smell woods and pepper. Luckily the middle notes are very aromatic, like fresh lavender. The drydown is soft and sweet with a touch of natural vanilla. Well done, Penhaligon's!"", 'Lavandula angustifolia is Latin for true or ""common"" lavender. It is very apparent from the first application, that Penhaligons has (as always) surrounded the central theme of this scent with accompaniment that really brings out its true beauty... The opening is sharp and warm and green. A dash of pepper and a shave of cinnamon add warmth to the basil, though none of these overpower the pure purple flowers; only enrich them. Lavender on the inhale, with soft spices and warm green on the exhale...beauteous! The heart is all about the flowers, aromatic flowers like in an alpine mountain meadow or a field near Grasse. It is accompanied on each side by the sheer green beauty of muguet and a smooth herbal sage (clary, no doubt). Lavender is often described as soapy, airy/dry and having woody and green nuances; all that is here in a very refined form, extremely elegant and quite proper. I am as mystified as Sherapop is, at how they wove together normally zesty spices and dry florals into something so very smooth and sexy in the drydown (not that lavender is unsexy, or anything). Ultimately, as the scent of Provence fields fade, the slightly floral feel is still there and still clean...but now somehow resiny and sweet without becoming heavy. Amber adds an incensy feel as tonka and vanilla blend into something earthy, smooth and sensual (but not sweet or gourmand); as just a hint of musk entices without reeking or being too animalic. Definitely NOT just your run-of-the-mill soliflore here, Lavandula takes Yardley\'s Old English Lavender to the next level...without losing sight of the flower itself and all its intrinsic qualities. Sillage: good Longevity: average Overall: 3.75/5  Penhaligons does it again! Here one of the most common flowers in perfume is exalted and adorned without ever becoming lost in the ""mix"". This is elegant and amazing, right through to the drydown. This perfume stays the course between quality and simplicity, without ever being boring. Grand but unassuming, it is rich and intersting without being ostentatious or too complex...', 'I dearly love Lavender!!! And yet -- I rarely want a perfume that is only lavender. For that: I\'ll just smear on some essential oil of Lavandula Augustiflora. I want lavender ---- and a little something else. It is that \'something else\' that usually disappoints.  Lavender mixes well with nearly everything; sadly, many notes obscure lavender, and \'take over\' the composition. Penhaligon has prevented that beautifully. This is a complex lavender. It is lavender - and more. Sweet - but not too sweet. Fresh, but not citrus-y. This is definitely a unisex fragrance, as I can see men or women wearing it. Although, not every man, and not every woman. This if a fragrance a gentleman would wear, but a guy probably wouldn\'t. A lady in the Boardroom would wear it, but a woman in the Boudoir mightn\'t. I don\'t echo the previous reviewer\'s sentiments regarding ""a little going a long way"". I felt that it was quite light - I questioned if I really had enough on. It does have good longevity, and is one of few Penhaligon\'s that has considerable sillage, as it elicited a rare, and rarer still: favorable, reaction from my husband. My 1-ml sample vial is now empty. I am ordering a full-size, post haste!', 'I\'ve got ""gardener\'s credentials"" when it comes to lavender. I grow several varieties of lavender in my garden and have one planter near the walk to my front door, positioned for a quick sniff as I come and go. I can tell you with certainty: Penhaligon\'s Lavendula opens with lavender notes so AUTHENTIC that a blindfolded person couldn\'t distinguish this from a bouquet of fresh lavender. Ah, if only my nose had more patience. All due respect to those who enjoy this and have the patience to wait through the opening. I envy you. What\'s the problem? The problem is I put just a drop on each wrist from a carded Penhaligon vial and couldn\'t even wait 5 minutes before I had to scrub it off. I don\'t see how I could have applied less.  This is the strongest lavender I\'ve ever encountered but it\'s just too much for me. At this price point I feel obligated to advise: Try before you buy.', ""I was fully prepared to dismiss Penhaligon LAVANDULA out of hand. Another lavender? I thought. How wrong I was! This beautiful composition, as advertised, opens as a lavender perfume: as loud as a big bunch of freshly dried light purple flowers, high-quality essential oil or concentrated aromatherapeutic spray. As sumptuous as Perlier Lavender Cream Bath.  From there, however, LAVANDULA evolves into an exquisite oriental fragrance with hardly any lavender at all by the drydown. I believe that I am starting to see a trend in Penhaligon's creations: many of them have a similar base, which is often a variation of just this lovely oriental. All of the elements are blended together harmoniously so as to avoid any emphasis on one or another note. How they managed to mesh this base seamlessly with a very aromatic lavender opening is a mystery to me. But the true identity of LAVANDULA would seem to inhere in its enduring drydown, not in its considerably brasher and shortlived opening. This is a welcome creation, as I would never really want to wear a predominantly lavender fragrance in public, but this one allows the wearer to spray with reckless abandon, and then by the time she leaves the house, it's become something else altogether: very likeable, very social-gatherings appropriate, understated yet elegant."", 'This is like the real thing lavender perfume. I like it very, very much and find it pretty, easy, sweet, aromatic and wonderfully comforting. A perfume to put on when you want to relax or if you feeling a bit cold or tired. It¬¥s so nice to have a fragrance that will put you in the most wonderfully comfy and lovely mood only with a few drops. A must try. May very well be the only lavendel dominated perfume you need. It is so good, powerful (a little goes a long way) longlasting and suitable for both men and women, I also think a cranky kid would be eased if to borrow a few drops of it.  Be sure to not miss this pretty gem.', 'Lovely lavender fragrance! Not dry like a traditional lavender, but sweet and round and complex. I get a special feeling when I sniff my wrist wearing this, it tickles my gut like I am in love. Truly wonderful! I have more thing to say about this, but I dont know how to put it. I will go back and edit if I find the words.', ""I have aways loved the smell of lavender.  As a child I would catch bees inside yoghurt pots and then hold them to my ear pretending them to be walkie-talkies with the trapped bees buzzing around inside. Then I would set the bees free and be left feeling dizzy from the excitement and from the powerful scent of the lavender bushes all around me. As a teenager I often bought bottles of pure essential oil of Lavender and sprinkled it on my pillows and evaporated it in oil burners.  As an adult, I have always looked for Lavender fragrances that do justice to my happy memories and that are not too 'feminine' as can often be the case with lavender based frags.  My absolute favourite is Annick Goutal's Eau de Lavande which is now sadly discontinued. I am lucky to still have a good 50ml or so and will savour that juice until my dying days. Penhaligon's Lavandula is a lovely fragrance although it took me a long while to properly appreciate it because I was so enamoured with the Annick Goutal scent.  Lavandula is a very realistic lavender yet is also something a little more. I can definitely detect a touch of cinnamon and musk and although it is not listed, I can almost detect something very close to cardamon; it is just the perfect tiny hint of dirtiness to balance the almost overpowering cleanliness of the overall composition. Lavandula is one of the purest and cleanest scents I have ever experienced, especially in the drydown. It is the scent to be worn by handsome priests or beautiful surgeons. You trust whoever is wearing this scent and fall silent with a gentle reverence."", ""Lavandula is very IMPRESSIVE! I was a bit nervous about ordering this having never smelled it before, but I wanted so badly to love it, and it did not disappoint. It's everything I was hoping for.  I've never owned a perfume that was based around lavender. When used in fragrance, lavender can smell really weedy and bitter. I wanted something that smelled like the actual flower, but that would remain sweet and soft. I also hoped and prayed that this would be more of an herbal & aromatic perfume, and it's just as I wished for. The opening concerned me as being a tad on the masculine side. I could smell woods and pepper. Luckily the middle notes are very aromatic, like fresh lavender. The drydown is soft and sweet with a touch of natural vanilla. Well done, Penhaligon's!"", ""I was fully prepared to dismiss Penhaligon LAVANDULA out of hand. Another lavender? I thought. How wrong I was! This beautiful composition, as advertised, opens as a lavender perfume: as loud as a big bunch of freshly dried light purple flowers, high-quality essential oil or concentrated aromatherapeutic spray. As sumptuous as Perlier Lavender Cream Bath.  From there, however, LAVANDULA evolves into an exquisite oriental fragrance with hardly any lavender at all by the drydown. I believe that I am starting to see a trend in Penhaligon's creations: many of them have a similar base, which is often a variation of just this lovely oriental. All of the elements are blended together harmoniously so as to avoid any emphasis on one or another note. How they managed to mesh this base seamlessly with a very aromatic lavender opening is a mystery to me. But the true identity of LAVANDULA would seem to inhere in its enduring drydown, not in its considerably brasher and shortlived opening. This is a welcome creation, as I would never really want to wear a predominantly lavender fragrance in public, but this one allows the wearer to spray with reckless abandon, and then by the time she leaves the house, it's become something else altogether: very likeable, very social-gatherings appropriate, understated yet elegant."", ""The best lavender EVER. THAT'S!! the south of France that I adore so much! Lavender in all depth and complication full stop. Authentic, pure, true, nostalgic, deep, aromatic with beautiful dry hay undertones, caressing not only your skin, but soul and heart, evoking forgotten memories, healing and embracing. Melancholic, clever herbal-spicy concoction. I can't stop wearing it at night, as it does something amazing with my own self - I start dreaming amazing things and ....what is there L.Turin said about it?...Bet he will get into perfume hell for being so ignorant and useless with far too many failed descriptions."", 'I dearly love Lavender!!! And yet -- I rarely want a perfume that is only lavender. For that: I\'ll just smear on some essential oil of Lavandula Augustiflora. I want lavender ---- and a little something else. It is that \'something else\' that usually disappoints.  Lavender mixes well with nearly everything; sadly, many notes obscure lavender, and \'take over\' the composition. Penhaligon has prevented that beautifully. This is a complex lavender. It is lavender - and more. Sweet - but not too sweet. Fresh, but not citrus-y. This is definitely a unisex fragrance, as I can see men or women wearing it. Although, not every man, and not every woman. This if a fragrance a gentleman would wear, but a guy probably wouldn\'t. A lady in the Boardroom would wear it, but a woman in the Boudoir mightn\'t. I don\'t echo the previous reviewer\'s sentiments regarding ""a little going a long way"". I felt that it was quite light - I questioned if I really had enough on. It does have good longevity, and is one of few Penhaligon\'s that has considerable sillage, as it elicited a rare, and rarer still: favorable, reaction from my husband. My 1-ml sample vial is now empty. I am ordering a full-size, post haste!', ""Blind bought it based on the reviews and my attraction to lavender scents. Unfortunately that was a big mistake.  In general I've grown to like complex, sexy (meaning vanilla and wood) fragrances these days. This one smells like lavender for 2 minutes, then turned into a strange soapy smell that is never pretty nor relaxing and definitely not sexy.  I then layered it with Mon Guerlain, to give it a little more lavender punch. It worked okay.  To summarize, sample first, do NOT blind buy."", ""I love the top notes it's bright and soft, but then as it develops I think gets too powdery, I like it, but I'm afraid I would get sick of it after some time.I think I will stick with Yardley Lavander, much nicer for me. I notice people comparing it to Chanel Jersey and I don't smell any similarity. Jersey contain Rose and Tonka Bean and Lavandula don't, I adore Jersey and cannot stand Lavandula, they are so different."", 'Straight up lavender- not herbally enough for me', 'It smells really nice for a second but disappears in a whiff.

The cassis gives a slightly grass note that I like. The dry down leaves less fig that I like', 'This scent is discoutinued :(', ""I finally figured out what this reminds me of...the drydown is identical to the smell of a dry erase marker lol that's why it smells synthetic to me. Purple Fig by Vilhelm is similar without that synthetic aspect."", 'A nice fig scent. I have a collection of fig scents, and this seems to combine DNA facets of many of them, while distinguishing itself somewhat in the genre. It is quite green due to its grass, pine, and cassis notes, and maybe a bit astringently so. But never unpleasantly so, especially mixed with the milky fruitiness. While it is the quality of its greeness that distinguishes it, particularly due to its grass note, it is different than Dior Dune Pour Homme. Dune has that astringent bitter moist green of the interior of a fig tree limb or twig, and lacks the milky fruitiness of Wild Fig & Cassis. This is worth adding a full bottle to my growing fig scent collection.', 'This reminds me of a hike through a meadow in late June, when plants are developing more pungent scents in the summer heat. At first, I really disliked it, but I have become fascinated with the interplay of the notes as I have worn it more. It is beautiful layered over Vanilla Musk by Coty.', 'Anyone sad that this got discontinued, you can get a clone from Eden Perfumes :) I‚Äôve been collecting perfumes for 9 months and almost a connoisseur by now. Something I‚Äôve been doing frequently is noticing similar notes or accord profiles between different brands and comparing slight differences and overall quality to optimize my selections. I‚Äôve noticed that this has a similar profile to Purple Fig by Vilhelm Parfumerie, which also envelops fig in a woody and pine tree musk but the fig in this is much more luscious and jammy.', ""I recently got a 10ml decant and have tried it a few times. It's underwhelming so far. Opens with a burst of green that reminds me of unripe bananas. Actually, it kind of smells like Diptyque's Figuier candle (which is not at all like their Philosykos fig). Green bananas for days. However, the astringent quality of WF&C is tempered by implied florals as it settles. Lasts about 2-3 hours. On the whole, it's not unpleasant but I'm going to save the rest of the decant for warmer weather because I think the floral aspect will come out more then."", 'One of the most comforting, clean-floral-musk dry-downs. The scent itself is juicy, slightly jammy and the fig note is a clean, green one. Thankfully this is missing that sickly coconutty nuance many cheap fig scents have that devour all other notes. As such, this is perfectly unisex. The dry down is SO cosy and musky I almost don‚Äôt care that it projects so little (as with all of Jo Malone) because sometimes a quiet, intimate scent is better in certain situations, like family time at home on a Sunday. I‚Äôm sad it‚Äôs discontinued as there are few other fig scents as pleasant as this in my opinion.', ""This smells intriguing and earthy but seems to give me a sinus infection if I wear it enough and have sensitized to something in this one. Pretty sure its an allergic reaction to the overwhelming grass notes as the florals in here I have in other fragrances that don't do the same thing to me. I wore this mostly in the summer and it projected with good sillage. I think it needs more fig and less grass. I distinctly recognized this on someone at the mall and it projected at least 6-10 feet on them, overwhelmed my senses, and choked me out."", 'I was unsure about this one at first, but the more I wear it, the more I like it. I get the softly sweet fig and wet grass scent immediately, but there is also a very sharp, leafy bitterness (I assume that\'s the cassis). I don\'t mind a little bitterness here and there, but this is quite strong and soapy, even detergent-y. Something about it also reminds me of going to the pool as a kid, but I can\'t put my finger on it - does it remind me vaguely of chlorine? Did the soaps in the showers there smell like this? Was it the cypress bushes I sat next to on my towel during the adult swims? I don\'t know, but I get the same scent memory from Hermes Un Jardin en Mediterranee. Anyway, once the fragrance settles down on the skin, I get more of the pine coming through and the scent moves away from soap and more towards refreshing-nature-walk-in-the-forest, and that\'s when I really start to love it. This is one of the few scents my partner has commented on positively (""it smells good in here"" minutes after spraying). It leans *slightly* masculine, but like most Jo Malones, it\'s authentically botanical enough that it can go either way. Unfortunately they don\'t sell this scent in a 30ml and I have yet to see it in a sample pack or on a discount site, so the only way to get it is to go whole hog and buy the 100ml. Frustrating.', ""I am so happy this blind buy is amazing! Wow... it is the perfect woody, natural signature scent that is inoffensive. The initial spray is very grassy, like wet grass. Eventually the fig and hyacinth comes and gives it this beautiful creaminess note that I want to keep smelling. I can see myself wearing this all year round, but I think the earthy notes will be really nice in the fall time. As most people mention, the lasting power is poor, but on some areas of my body it does stay on longer. I work in an office where we are not suppose to wear fragrances, however I can get away with this one as no one can smell it but me. If you are a woodsy, nature loving kind of person, this scent is for you! Also, no headache inducing whatsoever, perfect for those like me who get headaches. This is my favourite scent ever, and I can't wait to try more Jo Malone products.."", ""This is a great fig fragrance. I blind bought this and it was exactly as I had hoped it would smell. I make soaps, and this smells like a fragrance oil I have called 'green fig' which I also absolutely love and was hoping so hard this would be similar. It is indeed fresh and green. Not at all like a fig jam, or a syrupy overripe fig. I smell no cassis. I don't get the grass smell that others do, thankfully because I do not like the scent of grass. Definitely a unisex offering.  To me, this was nothing like Diptyque's philosykos which smelled coconuty and heady, to the point of giving me a headache and I had to scrub off. I wouldn't write this one off if you don't like philosykos, but are still intrigued by fig.  Longevity on this one is poor for me, I get maybe 3-4 hours. Still happy to have it because I haven't smelled anything else like it apart from my fragrance oil from soaping."", 'Hyper green, grassy and almost caustic somehow. If you like greens, if you like fig scents - give this a try. But remember that there is no milkiness of a fig here. Nada.', 'A great fig fragrance if you are into it. I find fig to be a scent that is ""different"" from normal fragrances. It\'s very green and fresh but not so much that it\'s too much. I also have Philosykos by Diptyque and they are similar fig fragrances. I find Philosykos to perform much better, but I prefer the smell of the Jo Malone one. I have 4 Jo Malone fragrances, one of which is an intense version. They are all very faint and fade quickly, which is frustrating. I had the same issue with Wood Sage and Sea Salt. The scents are nice but fade to nothing. After about an hour my mother couldn\'t smell anything on me and she was within arms distance. She only smelled me faintly with her nose up against my arm. Now, it\'s been a bit more than 3 hours and I can barely smell it on my arm. I also sprayed a couple of spritzes on my clothing and I can\'t smell anything now. I don\'t think I will spend the money on JM fragrances anymore- they are nice and many of them unique but it\'s not worth it if they don\'t perform at all.', 'Finding this to be hyper-green and eminently soapy in the opening.  This would be a complete turn-off if not for a halo of floral breathiness that is hovering above the greenness. Truly feels like putting my nose right into a bundle of fresh-cut baby\'s breath. A woody sweetness, which I can only assume is the cassis/pine combo, is also setting in.  I am picking up a scent that smells like whichever accord is used to give Davidoff Cool Water (and all the men\'s shaving creams that imitate it) that so-called ""aquatic"" smell. It seems a little discordant mixed with all this greenery. This perfume walks the line between ""too naturalistic"" and ""A human body should smell like this."" I think for my tastes, this would be a much better scent for a candle. It freaks me about a bit to have a scent this ""leafy"" on my skin! I have not yet given Philosykos a serious test, but I imagine the coconut in it adds a creaminess that makes a fig scent much more suitable to the human body. Husband says it smells like a hotel.', ""My stomach used to turn at the mere whiff of cassis so I avoided this one from Jo Malone. Lately, I have come around to the cassis & even black currant notes. Probably due to finding cassis in the right combinations that please my senses instead of turn my stomach. It's very green here while highlighting the fig. What makes this so much more different than Philosykos to me is the fir note and I really like it."", 'The cassis in the name should have tipped me off that this is a total scrubber. The fig in the dry down is green and uplifting. However the first hour or so is very potent fig leaf and cassis. If you like fig give it a try, but I think I am learning that it isn‚Äôt my note', ""I've been sampling as many perfumes as I can for years, but this is the first Jo Malone I've ever tested properly. I guess I've been prejudiced, mostly because the lineup of this brand seems to be more fickle than most: whenever I spot a scent of theirs that seems right up my alley, it seems to be discontinued more often than not. On top of that, whenever I did quickly test any of them in a store, my first impression has always been that they're too natural-smelling for their own good: rather sharp and onedimensional, and not really interesting.  So when I did get a decant of Wild Fig & Cassis in a split (because this is a note list that is so exactly up my alley that any prejudices were silenced immediately), and my first impression was the same negative one as always, I promptly proceeded to ignore it for months and maybe even years. And now I could kick myself for it, because in the meantime it has indeed been discontinued, but otherwise all my prejudices have crumbled: now that I've finally given it some real attention, I absolutely love it.  After the first opening, which I find just slightly sharp now that I'm used to it, this is just a perfect green scent - fresh green notes combined with the fruity woody green of fig and cassis. So delicious, and very natural indeed, but not boring at all after all.  I've learned my lesson: never trust a first impression, and never trust your prejudices - if I hadn't, I wouldn't have to start looking for a hard to find, probably expensive bottle of this now..."", 'So much better than philosykos.

Its longevity and sillage are not that good. Also in comparison to other fig scents I own (e.g. Diptyque's Philosykos), this scent has a melancholy hint. I don't know why."", 'My favorite fig perfume as well as Womanity by Thierry Mugler. I know the quite similar Philosykos from Diptyque is more often talked about but I much prefer the Jo Malone. To me Philosykos lacks the atmosphere that Wild Fig & Cassis carries. WF&C reminds me of an ethereal humid tropical mountainside, with a sheer floral veil over creamy, almost coconutty fig. There is a predominant green minty note which feels so fresh. Like most Jo Malone fragrances lasting power and strength are somewhat below average, not terrible, but still not the best for the money. I do, however, think this scent makes up for it in gorgeousness. It is discontinued now unfortunately.', ""I think it's nice for room as a candle not for a body perfume the smell taking you in relax mood as you sit on garden"", ""Absolutely adore Jo Malone Wild Fig & Casis However, there is some bad news for us fans of this beautiful scent...

This really is my favourite Jo Malone fragrance and I'm very saddened to hear of this decision - unfortunately due to the high price point of Jo Malone fragrances here in NZ, my limit for 'stock up' would be two 100mL bottles which wont last me more than two years :( so if you have any bottles of this you no longer use please contact me.

Wonderful combinations for anytime of the year, however, being colognes, they are lighter than edp and slightly lighter than edt in perfume oil concentration.', 'Around when I landed my first job out of college, I set out on a journey to find my ""signature scent"". I knew it would be different, unconventional, and fresh. That scent ended up being (don\'t laugh) a room spray by The Body Shop: Vert de Bamboo.

I layered this with a neroli perfume and it was an absolutely beautiful combination, if I say so myself.

Really lovely."", ""Opens with a lot of green grass with a subtle hint of a smoky tobacco. Wasn't very keen on the opening.

Fresh...."", ""Jo Malone's Wild Fig and Cassis is an earthly delight straight from a Mediterranean garden.  Smelling this transports me to a dark garden of the Greek Isles on a rare cloudy afternoon. I am lazily reading The Iliad with a bowl of black cherries in my lap when I hear thunder and a crack of lightening. I envision myself running for cover from the unexpected shower with my white dress flowing behind me. I find shelter underneath a cluster of fig trees. I can feel wet fig leaves, grass, and mud between my toes... I usually do not enjoy green scents but this is an earthy and sweet dark green scent. By dark I mean wet and deep. There's nothing fresh, light, or too sharp about it. The most obvious notes in this JM cologne are grass and fig. It's very pleasant and comforting to me. Something I wasn't expecting from this fragrance is the cherry top notes. It reminds me of childhood. For a slight instant it smells like Luden's cherry cough drops! Which can be good or bad depending on what I'm in the mood for. The cherry and fig notes never have a chance to develop into a sickly sweet smell thanks to a soft pine note and refreshing cedar dry down. Also noticeable are humble patchouli and exotic cyclamen notes.  I think this fragrance would suit men and women with a green thumb or who classify themselves as outdoorsy. It would work well for anyone who likes earthy smells like grass, pine, or dirt. I personally enjoy the unusualness of Jo Malone's Wild Fig and Cassis. I prefer this scent on easy days when I walk my dogs or spend time in the yard. It's definitely a summer scent for me."", 'Smells like grass. Too sweet. I am really not a fan of thia fragrance.', ""Jo Malone WILD FIG & CASSIS smells to me rather like a bunch of fig leaves and grass blades thrown in a blender. Very, very green and fairly sharp as well, especially in the opening minutes. Is this composition sweet at all? No. The fig leaf is featured, not the fruit nor the wood.  To my nose, the grass, fig leaf and hyacinth together conspire to make this a very green experience indeed, although I do not detect the pine as an isolable note‚Äîwhich is probably a good thing in this case... Fig is clearly the focus, especially in the drydown (which is quite a bit less sharp than the opening), but there is a huge amount of greenishness to this cologne from start to finish! In the opening minutes, I am even reminded a bit of the discontinued BELEAF, by The Body Shop‚Äîalthough that composition lacked fig. This composition, too, is fully unisex, even leaning a bit toward the masculine side. The longevity of WILD FIG AND CASSIS is as to be expected from Jo Malone, but if green fig leaves are what you're really after, then this natural-smelling cologne may serve you well! Not for me."", 'A rare failure from Jo Malone in my book. I can\'t smell the cassis, unless that it the bitter note fighting with the ""sticky"" smell that I take to be fig. I don\'t like it at all.', 'The character of this scent on my skin is very, very grassy along with a bit of woodiness. It is quite bitter on first spray, then it mellows out to become a bit softer.

Thank you,"", ""The nicest of all Jo Malone's scents, in my opinion. I love the strong fig note and the cassis is quite fresh and subtle, rather than sweet as you might expect.  Unfortunately, there's a base note I find in all the Jo Malone scents which smells a bit 'stale' on my skin and spoils them all for me. I find them better as home fragrances for that reason."", 'While the fig note is certainly there, a tomato note dominates the opening of this fragrance. It reminds me of plucking fruit at a farm. Soft tobacco note underneath. Ideal for gardening types I would think. Good silage, longevity 2/5.', ""What an unusual scent for a perfume :-/. It's the kind of 'smell once and enjoy the unique quality and creativiy behind it' scent, not really a scent I could imagine wearing by itself, but it would mix with something very soft like Orange Blossom."", ""Sweet bubblegum? Wow, that just shows how unique every individual's skin chemistry is! I never tried a Jo Malone perfume before, and I'm so glad I did! How can there be no fig in this? It smells just perfectly of fig trees in fruit, really ripe, but I have to confess, I get no sense of a mediterranean sun above, on my skin the scent is cool not warm, with a real sense of moisture and air, as though the branches were shaking in a high wind after rain. The bubble gum touch noticed by Chance25 completely missed me as did the pine, and the sweetness was nicely cut by the currant notes, with the cyclamen as an unexpected winner!  This is a beautiful fresh green woody smell, with a base that I can only describe as having a very slight almost biscuity edge to it. After four/five hours most of all this is gone, but a touch of herbs akin to green tea with a soft hint of powder remains. I could wear this anywhere, it reminds me that I am a free spirit!"", 'My first thought of this scent before trying it was either it was going to be too masculine or too overwhelming as fig can sometimes be. None were true. This is mostly a soft floral w/ fig as a nice partner. There is pine in this and it is present to my nose. Not in a x-mas tree sort of way but a freshness that only pine can create. The dry down sort of smells like sweet bubble gum. Such a surprising little gem this is!', ""Jo Malone's Wild Fig and Cassis is an earthly delight straight from a Mediterranean garden.  Smelling this transports me to a dark garden of the Greek Isles on a rare cloudy afternoon. I am lazily reading The Iliad with a bowl of black cherries in my lap when I hear thunder and a crack of lightening. I envision myself running for cover from the unexpected shower with my white dress flowing behind me. I find shelter underneath a cluster of fig trees. I can feel wet fig leaves, grass, and mud between my toes... I usually do not enjoy green scents but this is an earthy and sweet dark green scent. By dark I mean wet and deep. There's nothing fresh, light, or too sharp about it. The most obvious notes in this JM cologne are grass and fig. It's very pleasant and comforting to me. Something I wasn't expecting from this fragrance is the cherry top notes. It reminds me of childhood. For a slight instant it smells like Luden's cherry cough drops! Which can be good or bad depending on what I'm in the mood for. The cherry and fig notes never have a chance to develop into a sickly sweet smell thanks to a soft pine note and refreshing cedar dry down. Also noticeable are humble patchouli and exotic cyclamen notes.  I think this fragrance would suit men and women with a green thumb or who classify themselves as outdoorsy. It would work well for anyone who likes earthy smells like grass, pine, or dirt. I personally enjoy the unusualness of Jo Malone's Wild Fig and Cassis. I prefer this scent on easy days when I walk my dogs or spend time in the yard. It's definitely a summer scent for me."", ""This is such a well done fig scent. I love the scent right out of the gate. However, like most Jo Malone scents the longevity is a joke!!! Seriously, this did not last beyond an hour on me!! I am so disappointed. I know I know it's a cologne and layering helps but for the price we should get more bang for our buck!!! Philosykos is very similar and lasts A LOT longer on my skin. Sorry Jo Malone/Estee Lauder. Diptyque will get my business from now on."", 'Around when I landed my first job out of college, I set out on a journey to find my ""signature scent"". I knew it would be different, unconventional, and fresh. That scent ended up being (don\'t laugh) a room spray by The Body Shop: Vert de Bamboo. When I wore it, my then-bf would say I smelled \'like a green plant\', and I *loved* it. Fast forward 10-ish years. VdB long discontinued, perfume tastes matured (or maybe not)... Wild Fig & Cassis whips me right back to those days. It starts off with a verdant twang and settles into a fresh green fig with a musky backer. On me, this lasts several hours. Love it.', ""This is a great fig fragrance. I blind bought this and it was exactly as I had hoped it would smell. I make soaps, and this smells like a fragrance oil I have called 'green fig' which I also absolutely love and was hoping so hard this would be similar. It is indeed fresh and green. Not at all like a fig jam, or a syrupy overripe fig. I smell no cassis. I don't get the grass smell that others do, thankfully because I do not like the scent of grass. Definitely a unisex offering.  To me, this was nothing like Diptyque's philosykos which smelled coconuty and heady, to the point of giving me a headache and I had to scrub off. I wouldn't write this one off if you don't like philosykos, but are still intrigued by fig.  Longevity on this one is poor for me, I get maybe 3-4 hours. Still happy to have it because I haven't smelled anything else like it apart from my fragrance oil from soaping."", ""It is a quite authentic, understated version of fig. I like it a lot.

Sniffing my way around it I could sense it was trying to be spicy, and edging towards some qualities of pepper ... but all its more interesting, louder notes just seemed to get muffled in something. Maybe the milk and honey others mention, which I didn't pick up on consciously but might have been the culprits for this being an altogether weak sauce, compared to the tingly pepper blast I was hoping for.

Plus, after about 20 minutes it transfers to sugary and milky notes which are so comformting, but it still has some twist with now soft pepper. Overall I recommend it to people who like explore unique and intresting scents, but this wont give you the sillage and it's not a long lasting fragnance. Only when you want a little something-something."", ""This must have been my very first niche perfume several years back. I tried this in a perfume bar in Rome (such a wonderful concept!) and immediately noticed the pepper. I think I categorized it as white pepper, slightly subtle and spicy, but in no way peppery 'piquant'. I liked it though, so did my partner. It was unlike the generic stuff I always smelled in drugstores. So even though I can't say I was smitten, I went ahead and bought it. That's what holidays in Rome are for :) Within a few days something strange happened. I suddenly picked up the licquorice, which is a smell/taste/product I can't stand. And I could never 'unsmell' it again. It was there from the very opening, untill the drydown hours later. Not as in spicy anis, but sharp, salty licquorice.  I was so bummed. My bottle has been left unused for years. But I kept on reading reviews from people experiencing this as milky, creamy yumm-ness. I wanted that!  Yesterday, I gave it another try. I've learned a little more about perfumery since I first bought Poivre Piquant and I hoped my slightly better trained nose could make something else out of this. I applied it (dabbed instead of sprayed!) and yup.. there was that sharp licquorice again. BUT.. after an hour or so some other notes did make it up to my brain. The licquorice is too prominent for me to distinguish what else I smelled, but yes there was the comfort that some others mention. Still, the licquorice is too much for me. So I think--after a retest--I'm ready to let this go now."", ""If you're interested in Poivre Piquant as a possible dupe for the discontinued Le Feu d'Issey, here's what you need to know: Poivre Piquant is far more peppery and woody, but it has a similar sort of balance with the woody and milky tones. However, it has none of the floral part of Le Feu and despite the note pyramid listing more gourmand notes, Poivre Piquant smells inedible in a way that Le Feu does not. The sillage and longevity are definitely lacking in this fragrance, as well.  Unfortunately I can't fully recommend it as a dupe for Le Feu d'Issey. Oh well, the search continues..."", ""Artisan nailed it, again. This perfume is one of my favourite in their range, it's so unusual and comforting. It's not really a perfume as such, I see it more as an olfactory painting.  A lot of people mention the work 'spicy' when talking about it. 'Piquant' in French means not as much spicy as prickly or original. The top note in Poivre Piquant is without doubt pepper, vibrating on the skin and in my nose. It is probably one of the most real rendition of freshly milled pepper I have met in perfumery. Pepper sprinkled all over equally freshly baked bread. As it develops, you get more sweetness coming from the honey and milk, and then a touch of liquorice kicks in. The image for me is the cosy, wooden kitchen, and a rustic breakfast made up of bread, butter, honey, and the pepper sprinkled on top.  It is not really a very foody or gourmand scent despite all the ingredients, and it is so addictive!  It has quite a good staying power too, on me is lasts a few hours and projects well."", ""The thick of the unforgiving foliage threatens to drown out everything you've worked toward - the sun scorches this land in its fiery, peppered licks. Swimming in your own sweat, your eyes burn as you struggle to find your way through this lush wasteland. You climb and crawl and fall, time and again, hoping that what you seek is more than pure fantasy....your life lingers on this truth. Your body starts to collapse as each step becomes more difficult than the last...the world grows darker with each passing moment...you fall with a dense thud. An immeasurable amount of time passes...night and day lose meaning as you cling to life. From the depths, it calls to you - a sharp floral note rekindles your neural spark. You gasp for air as if awoken from the grave - you scramble toward this familiar yet alien scent...roses, iris, freesia, acidic greenery - it guides you toward your destination. Each step brings you closer - it appears before you in a flash. She sits, resting against a tree - she holds her side as a thick honey-like substance slowly trickles out. Startled, she locks eyes with you but relaxes as if seeing an old friend. Amazed, you examine her - you see what looks like fountains of flowers flowing beneath her transparent skin, the honey is her life essence. She offers her hand to you - you hesitate for a moment before touching it, softly. In a instant, you are filled with the warmth of a hundred suns - you see everything the universe holds, the dark and the light and everything between. Everything gains perspective and your life makes sense in the endless chaos of living -- you cannot thank her enough for these revelations. When you open your eyes, all that's left of her is a radiating gem resting in your palm. You shed a tear as you hold the warm gem tight - you will do her kindness justice...for all.

Shortly after, the fume picks up a sharp floral note (it reminds me of the fumes I've tested with freesia in them) with accents of a cosmetic powder accord (rose and iris) and some crisp greenery. The freesia floral accord is accented beautifully by a touch of honey and a soft wood note that slowly fades into a rich white musk...and that's how the journey ends! This fume is classy and beautiful and I firmly believe it belongs on a woman's skin (even though I enjoy it as well...)! It took me several wears and the entire day to figure out what this smelled like....Chanel Exclusifs Beige!

One of fragrantica members make the comparison with Oxig√®ne lanvin. For me these are two completely different fragrancies. I like a lot Oxig√®ne uniqueness and creamy edge but do not like poivre piquant medicinal sharpness. Poivre piquant is a little bit chemical for my tastes and gives an impression of a hospital atmosphere with white walls and medicinal smell. I know I'm not on the same wave with most of reviewers in the appreciation of this fragrance. But my review aims to prevent from blind buy. Test before buy. I like many l'artisant perfumes but this one is just not for me. It's the first l'artisant that does not work with me."", ""Mmmmmn. Yum. a soft milky veil, cooled by licorice and dotted with fennel seed candy. Honestly, I barely get pepper from this; the fennel seed is way more prominent and so very pretty.

It\'s a thin, transparent, squeaky-sweet-plastic accord that calls to mind clean, freshly laundered cotton, nail varnish remover, pear drops, peach wine and shampooed hair.

Compliments were not something that he was comfortable with receiving. As soon as the girl skipped off to join her friends across the playground, the young boy lifted his school bag and gave it a sniff. He supposed it did smell rather nice, in its own way. He opened the bag and buried his face inside. The smell was much more prominent so he closed his eyes and smiled a secret smile inside the darkness of the bag.  Only a pampered young boy could have just such a school bag with a half eaten pot of \'honey and Greek yoghurt, a split packet of pepper (for a salad that he threw away on the way to school), a half chewed lace of licorice and a broken-zipped pencil case stuffed with pencil shavings. Only an inquisitive young girl could have shown him that such a combination of accidental smells was truly beautiful.', 'Yes! I like this one! Very much pepper at start but it actually reminds me of Le Feu and after a while its smother and very nice at my skin. Like it!', ""(Thanks to @yohji for decant!) I'd never got around to trying Poivre Piquant as I just thought 'Hm, a peppery perfume, can't be all that exciting', then when I read notes I imagined it might smell like creating a roux sauce with lots of ground black pepper. The reality took me quite by surprise, it opens on a glowing peppery warmth, not harsh, but almost like an aura emanating from someone's warm skin, slightly fizzy in effect. After half an hour or so it becomes creamier, smoother, like honeyed cream with cracked black pepper way in the background. It's very well blended, nothing leaps out except this sense of warm, subtly peppery/woody creaminess, slightly sweet.It's at its loveliest at this stage, which lasts for a couple of hours. As others have noted though it does fade slightly, but it's still there, probably not so noticable to your own nose, but still a lovely sillage, as you move around it's still detectable. (I gave quite a generous spray though, knowing that most L'Artisans can be quite low key) At its most creamy it's almost like a floriental, the honey/milk does feel like a creamy white floral in effect, yet more savoury, the liquorice is detectable to me more in dry down, lending (as the name suggests) piquancy.  The fact it reminds me of a floriental might make it lean more towards feminine to those wishing for a more unisex or masculine scent. One the other hand, if you wanted a stronger, sweeter honeyed, peppery floral oriental effect, for evening, say, you'd maybe like Tom Ford's Shanghai Lily or similar, but if you need something subtler, or for daytime, Poivre Piquant is tuly lovely I think. It's slightly dry because of wood/pepper, but warm, smooth and creamy too. It feels refined. Sillage quite strong for two to three hours, then lighter. Longevity about 5 hours plus. I couldn't choose a season for this, it could work year round"", ""I get around 5 hours longevity from this and although I quite like it for most of that time, there's only a 45min window where I'd jump to buy a full bottle.  It opens as pepper and woods. The pepper is very strong and the woods are dry. At this point I think it's quite nice, nothing overly special. About half an hour later, it morphs into a spicy, milky liquorice and I fall in love with it completely. Half an hour later, it's back to pepper and woods again and it never regains its former glory. I never get honey at all.  I kept feeling like there was something familiar about this. If Feminite Du Bois and Aimez Moi had a tryst on a bed of pepper, this might be the result.  Bertrand Duchafour's name has become synonymous with quality, and given his catalogue, rightly so, but I can't help but feel at times he's stretching himself a bit too thin. This perfume is an example of why. It's an 'almost' kind of a scent. It's almost full bottle worthy, almost original, almost satisfying. I'd love to smell a version of this that he'd taken more time to create."", ""Straight away - spicy honey, then woodiness and only in last stage milky-creamy pepper - thats how Poivre Piquant opens and develops on my skin. I personally wouldn't call this fragrance sweet-peppery one, as that type to me is Azzaro Visit, but I would call it woody-honeyed-licorice one,- sugar with honey and licorice mix is able to digest about a kilogramm of black pepper, so you will not sneeze from this frag for sure, but its a very relaxing, easy to wear one, not a schizophrenic type of smell. Love from me. Yet I would prefer more staying power."", 'Poivre Piquant, I like you..but not enough to buy you in full bottle form sorry! Pepper is obviously the main star of the show during the wet stages of this perfume. Not overly spicy pepper, but a dry toned down pepper. Slightly masculine, and the licorice is there too. The licorice in this smells SO real. It\'s pretty cool. So, at first its a peppery licorice and some kind of dry wood. It has two very distinct stages though. The dry down stage lasts about 45 minutes on me. I much prefer the dry stage. It\'s when the more pleasant notes can come forward. The honey gives this it\'s ""floral"" tone and it comes together quite nicely. It\'s not overly sweet at all, it stays on the drier side. There isn\'t really any apparent ""milky"" tones coming off of my skin but, it\'s definitely a more ""pretty"" perfume when it\'s dry. As subdued sweetness...a dry woodiness...a light pepper and a lovely honey that doesn\'t turn to...erm..urine. The entire fragrance is stripped back and has a simplicity about about it. It\'s a wallflower perfume not a monster.', ""TK Maxx I love you! I bougth it a ridiculous low price! Usually I don't like pepperly scents but this is very interesting...not loud, not scrached but creamy spicey. Not love but I like to wear."", 'Got it yesterday at our local TK Maxx for a song and boy does this perfume make me happy. it begins with a burst of crushed black peppercorns, followed by some deliciously smelling pencil shavings soaked in incense. I don\'t smell anything milky (but there is a certain opaque, warm softness to the scent that makes you think of warm milk) and if there is any honey, it\'s not particularly sweet or sticky. I detect a hint of licorice and maybe even dark chocolate, but both are too light to justify calling ""Poivre"" a gourmand fragrance and to diminish its luminosity.  It definitely reminds me of Feu d\'issey, which makes me love it even more.  The longevity is rather good even on my perfume-eating skin.  If you feel inclined to experiment, try to layer it with ""Dr√¥le de Rose"" - I found the result rather delightful.', ""This is the only perfume that I've tried recently that (in my opinion anyway) is unique, it doesn't remind me of anything else - it's one on its own. It was a blind buy based on other reviews here and I got it for a rock bottom price at TK Maxx, so it was well worth a try. I really, really like it, I'm not sure that I would call it unisex though, for me it smells more than feminine enough. The pepper is by far the loudest voice amongst the notes and for all the honey it isn't too sweet, which is good. I get the milkiness and a hint of powder, but I don't detect the liquorice or sugar at all. This is a delightful perfume that I'd be happy to wear at any time and in any climate, I never screams, it just states firmly 'I am quality' and I would highly recommend it."", ""Reading Phantosmia Bella's review of Le Feu d'Issey, which compared Le Feu to Poivre Piquant, made me irresistibly curious. Le Feu is one of my all time most beloved perfumes, so if there's a fragrance out there that smells like it, I want to know about it. And interestingly, PP does remind me of Le Feu. Poivre Piquant's opening note also smells like alcohol, but in a caustic way, rather than a boozy way. After that I get milk and pepper and honey that are very reminiscent of Le Feu, and very nice and cozy and sensual in their own right. My problem with Poivre Piquant, and this could easily be just a quirk of my own chemistry, since I seem to burn through all but the heartiest of perfumes awfully quickly, is that it has no staying power. I even made sure to get some PP on my clothes in the hopes of giving it a longer life, but it didn't help. I wish you luck, and a more docile chemistry than mine, because Poivre Piquant is lovely, and if you long for Le Feu you might feel a little better about the world for wearing it."", 'Any fragrance composition that Bertrand Duchaufour turns his hand to is sure to have a touch of magic to it! He is THE MASTER when it comes to niche perfumery in my book!!  While the top pepper note dominates there is a pleasant harmony to be found here with each note balancing the other perfectly.  If Marilyn Monroe was a fragrance this is what she would smell like... sweet, gentle, dreamy, ever so pretty, full of allure and dressed from head to toe in white!', 'Boy, talk about a surprise of an opening if you are not prepared. When you sniff it from the bottle it smells all warm and sweet and cozy and ""ahhhhh"". Then when you spray it, it is like HELLO spilled pepper shaker where did you come from...I\'m awake now!! It is a pretty heavy dose of white pepper. Then it settles into a VERY light, somewhat creamy peppered scent but you may not be able to smell it for a while and may think it went away completely....because of the pepper blast in the opening. For some people, a strong dose of pepper can temporarily sort of shut down the olfactory system or may keep it from working properly for a little while. (As a matter of fact, drug dealers use it to hinder drug sniffing dogs from finding their ""stash"".) So, before you think the entire fragrance is gone and start spraying yourself from head to toe...ask someone else if they can smell you. Or give it an hour or so. This is the odd thing about pepper...I love it in fragrances but when the dose is TOO heavy, I can\'t smell much else that accompanies it...so the other notes can be a little pointless for quite a while. I always wonder how the noses are able to come up with these realistic heavy peppered scents without killing their olfactory system and not being able to tell what they have come up with. Thank goodness I enjoy smelling pepper because that is about all I get for the first hour...then the scent fades to just a whisper. I think if the pepper was downplayed just a tad in the opening (and the milky part was boosted a bit) this would have been a much better and more well rounded fragrance. I am an enormous fan of L\'Artisan and for me they can basically do no wrong...but Poivre Piquant could have used a stronger dose of SOMETHING besides pepper.', ""I like this one and in time I could learn to love it. Starts simple with piquant black pepper, gains a bitter liquorice vibe, ends with a flowery sweetness that evokes sugared almonds. Sounds simple: pepper, liquorice, sugared almonds but the result is satisfying and a pleasure to wear. Minimal sillage means this will not impose on others thus could be ideal for work, travel, theatres, restaurants, religious settings - anywhere you need to be yourself, quietly assertive, without grabbing the limelight. Note of caution: I have described a simple, innocent fragrance and so it would be for many people. I think this might be ideal for a wedding (sugared almonds says virginal and bridal to me). But, on the other hand, I think this fragrance could be a surprise on the right person.  On a woman able to bring out the pepper and liquorice, the sour-bitter notes, and so belie the sugariness, I think this fragrance might say mystique, be exotic and erotic. There's something about it that, for me at least, evokes Anna Karenina as played by Greta Garbo. Indeed any woman played by Greta Garbo. Or maybe just Greta Garbo as played by Greta Garbo. She famously 'vants to be alone' but that just makes us vant to be alone with her. I don't know whether there would be any actual sex involved but there would be some sort of transport out of mundane life into something so much richer, so much more exciting.  On a man able to play up to the sugary almond, I think this fragrance could convey self-confidence, sexual complexity, playfulness, raunchiness. It reminds me of the scene from Mad Men where Roger Sterling sings 'Zou Bissou Bissou' (mimicking Don Draper's sexy young wife). Only a certain sort of man could make that funny and Sterling manages. He also makes it vaguely tragic and lets us see behind his clown's mask. He also makes his little song and dance erotic - tragic, comic, sexy how's that for complex. I can imagine him wearing this fragrance when he is doing that little dance. 'Piquant'? Absolutely!  So, a fragrance that can be played straight or given a clever twist. Played straight, I like it and would wear it to work. Played with a twist, I would love it and would be looking for an assignation outside of work... Ahem."", ""Obtained a sample of Poivre Piquant while searching for a replacement to le Feu d'Issey. Loved the fragrance; it is vaguely similar, but it only lasted a couple of hours on me. I'd consider it as a new signature if it had lasted longer."", ""This white pepper fragrance smells light and nice. It's even elegant lightness. I would prefer it to Piment Brulant if I was a pepper lover, but I hate this note. Despite it somehow I like this fragrance."", ""Went oddly salty/savory smelling on me halfway through. Kind of like soy sauce? Peculiar. I don't think I'll even finish my sample."", 'I can\'t speak for anyone else, but there\'s plenty of black pepper here for me. For the first 15-20 minutes, I am vividly reminded of ""Cracked Wheat and Pepper"" crackers. As the perfume mellows out on the skin, the pepper calms down enough for me to not only tolerate it but enjoy it immensely. I can\'t stand the smell of black pepper on other people, it\'s a real turn-off. Everyone knows that dairy makes the heat of spice less painful on the tongue, which is why Indian food is always accompanied by raita or lassi or whatever. It seems this concept works with scent too. Poivre Piquant becomes a creamy, mellow, black pepper fragrance, which makes it easier on my nose and hopefully the noses of others around me.  I love the authentic chai at my favorite Indian restaurant. They use more black peppercorns than others. I can really taste the peppercorns after they have simmered in the milk. Poivre Piquant reminds me of that flavor. It\'s by far the best pepper perfume I have ever had the pleasure of wearing.', ""Well well well... Nothing very special about this scent, I am always expecting more from Duchafour, but lately I'm facing only shallow and linear fragrances created by him.  First I looked at the notes and the composition inspired me to try the scent. Luckily, I ordered only a decant, not a FB. It opened with a huge pepper blast. No milk, no honey, no liquorice. It's not that I hate pepper, vice versa, I like it and I use many peppery frags, but in PP something is not quite there for me... Maybe I expected too much and what I got was juice similar to Cerruti Image (for women), which isn't bad itself, just for me became an absolutely simple and ordinary perfume, which I wear on the days when I feel indifferent about what to wear. Ironic. So - didn't impress me at all, to my big regret. I wish it really was sweet milk with pepper. Any ideas anyone?"", 'From the notes I expected a bit more, it opened with loads of black pepper and soon turned to smooth spicy milk (like a masala tea). I do find this delightful to my nose as I\'ve always told that I do enjoy good milk scents, but here is something that disturbs me a tiny bit. I love licorine, but here it\'s kinda not working on my skin, I think that honey might be a problem as I\'ve rarely enjoyed it in fragrances. All in all I should say that this is a good take on spicty/milk/masala perfume, but there are some better ones outhere and as already few of them are on my ""must buy"" list, this won\'t be joining them.', 'I would describe this fragrance as sexy and spicy as pepper. If you do smell carefully, yo can definitely smell the pepper note. Nice interesting fragrance. Different from the other mens fragrances out there withouth being off putting.', ""Don't be fooled by the listed notes here. Milk, honey and spice? yeah, right. Here's the basic outline of this perfume: opening: a blast of black pepper. very unusual in fragrances, but here it is - simply black pepper. but don't be scared, more is coming. later: flower. some kind of flower is in this composition, I can't put my finger on it - maybe peony, maybe rose (I don't think it's rose) god knows what it is, but it smells floral. dry-down: basically, a peppery floral scent. I'm not sure if I detect any milk here, maybe some licorice. The bottom line - modern peppery floral scent. So here, nothing gourmand-milky kind of stuff, it is predominately a peppery floral scent. Nevertheless, it smells good, I like it. It lasts good amount of time (for an EDT) and seems to project moderately."", ""It's so interesting reading reviews which sometimes reflect opposite opinions, tastes, sentiments compared to yours! I believe that many times the success or less of a fragrance is due to geography, longitude, latitude, weather and so on, rather than 'culture'. Not to say that our own chemistry can be influenced also by the air we breath, the food we eat and so on and consequently also fragrances can react - even more - very differently.... but here we are: Poivre Piquant today is the perfect frag for me! I find it very different when I wear it in winter (probably it's not a real winter frag) I agree the name could be misleading but look at the majority of the names used in perfumery - honestly - and say how many fragrances carry a proper name, which reflect the juice really?!? For instance if I call a frag 'poivre piquant' I should present it in a solid (powdery) form rather than a liquid one, shouldn't I?! Any way not many fragrances remind me P.P. and I personally think that its persistence is also great: I sprayed it this morning towards 9 o'clock a.m. and I'm not going to repeat it (now it's 17,41 p.m.) Not a great sillage, in the classical sense as it's stays close to you - but not too much - as normally only frags with a high percentage of natural elements do. As very often can happen with 'particular' or niche frags, it can be used sometimes but not every day. This is just what I've personally discovered, while using my Poivre Piquant and I'd like to share - all this - useful or not.  ; ) p.s. ....and I've always said that I cannot even stand licorice smell!!!"", 'In the opening, I got an intensive licorice note, along with the pepper and milk, but as it dried down, the licorice faded and I was left with a slightly sweet, milky pepper fragrance. It felt very sheer, and mostly focused on the pepper, but all in all a clean-feeling scent!', 'On my skin Poivre Piquant starts with a sharp peppery note. This peppery note is not too overwhelming and gradually blends into a warmer woody and subtle honey smell. This perfume is not sweet at all. It starts of quite strongly but settles down quickly into a very addictive, warm, slightly spicy and comforting fragrance.', ""I just got my sample. It's a lovely fresh and spicy fragrance. Pepper is what I can define without any doubt on my skin, especially at the beginning. Then I get hints of honey, pleasant and fragrant, not overpowering. It is different from many other fragrances. Quite original in my opinion. It would suit anyone in any occasion especially when you don't want to stick out, but still smell nice. It only lasts about an hour on me though. I'd have to keep reapplying. I don't think I'll buy a full bottle, but it's nice to have made Poivre Piquant's acquaintance. :)"", 'As a long-time consumer of 5-star spicy Thai food, the tear-jerking-spicy Indian and Mexican food served only in those countries, and other high-test chili-based goodies, it takes a lot of pepper to get my attention. I‚Äôm sorry to report that Poivre Piquant just doesn‚Äôt have what it takes.  This EdT is a weak, slightly sweet, and aromatic scent with a muted mix of anise, woody notes, rose, and vanilla along with what I could swear is a citrus-lavender cologne base. There‚Äôs a moderate amount of sillage, mostly in the woody-aromatic range, but not a lot of lasting power, maybe 3-4 hours tops. There‚Äôs certainly not the bold blast of pepper that I was expecting. This is not something that I‚Äôd wear, but it might be an option if you like gentle cologne-type fragrances.', 'This is one of the most amazing perfume ever! When I say ""amazing"" here, I dont mean it\'s the kind of smell that makes you ""Wow!"", but this one is the kind that makes you "" Hmm.. eh? Oh, my. I can\'t stop sniffing it on my hand!""  There\'s something calm but something drifting behind. The pepper note here doesn\'t smell like the ordinary pepper-featured perfumes. For me, it\'s not spicy at all. But you can still sense it, in a very moderate, smooth and balanced way. I think it\'s because there\'s milk and honey that calm the pepper note down but not making it disappear. Also, there\'s some soft sweetness. Like, you put a candy in your mouth and it melted slowly. Eventually the candy has totally gone but you can still \'taste\' the sweetness left behind, it doesn\'t taste as strong as the candy so you could have a good imagination in it. Light but not floating, soft but stable.', ""Think of this beauty as pink light in a bottle. It's luminous, aerial, a feather would be heavier. It is very discrete and very classy, speaks volumes about flawless taste. You will not be wearing a cloud of perfume, but the confidence such quality gives is really priceless. Cashmere wearers would understand this :)"", ""L'Artisan Parfumeur POIVRE PIQUANT reminds me very much of Lanvin OXYGENE. Both feature pepper and milk, which is a unique enough combination to make it easy to recall the few (n = 2) places in reality where one has encountered them together in perfume. Sure pepper goes well with creamed spinach soup (along with nutmeg...), but there are not very many fragrances which feature these notes in similar proportions. POIVRE PIQUANT, contrary to its name, is really quite smooth, definitely smoother than OXYGENE, which has a slightly sour cast on my skin (especially in the drydown), but also a bit smoky as well. Although the varieties of pepper appear to be different in the two fragrances, it really is the pepper which dominates the composition in both cases. Both have good longevity, as is typical of pepper-heavy perfumes. I recommend POIVRE PIQUANT to anyone who loves and wears OXYGENE, although you might want to save your big AP$$ for something else, since you probably need only one pepper-milk perfume, and OXYGENE may work just as well."", 'its brilliant! i really like it. maybe because it reminds me of only by givenchy, the scent i used to wear years ago..very pleasant and fresh perfume', 'This one is so good it makes me tingle! Peppery, fun,luminous - and yet it makes you take it seriously. I was surprised to feel a suede note in it and in the end it reminded me of an improved, polished and primped Lacoste pour femme, that I also love dearly. The difference between the sharp, spicy opening and the sultry heart is startling - the perfume plays on my skin,throwing at be bits of pepper,drops of honey, a spray of juice, a touch of cashmere. Radiating!', 'Maybe Poivre Piquant is not great smell , is not rich, but I very like it. When I want to smell natural, however, a bit spicy, I wear Poivre Puiquant. I like somewhat sharp, pepper smell of skin people, as my natural skin smell tender, I change it, scenting this pepper in parfum - simply and sophisticated ( pepper, milk, honey ) . Really Poivre Piquant is adorable and long lasting.', ""I bought the trio set, Les Epices de la Passion, and i love the hot-pepper scent of Piment Brulant and saffron and rose of Safran Troublant. But Poivre Piquant did little for me. I tried it a time or two, but it didn't have much scent. I began to fear i was anosmic. It was very faint and gentle, and i began sleeping in it. I've read that L'Artisan Parfumeur encourages layering their scents, so yesterday i made an experiment. I sprayed on Piment Brulant, then Poivre Piquant. And i could smell a difference. The sharp citrusy note i'm not fond of at the top of PB was gone, and the whole thing was softened, gentled, rounded, by the milk and honey notes in PP. It was a very successful experiment and now i appreciate PP more. Now i'll have to try it with Safran Troublant and see what happens. I may even try it with some other perfumes i have! I realize that perfumes contain more fragrance ingredients than those listed. In this case, the L'A P site lists ingredients as pink peppercorn, white pepper, milk, honey"", ""Spicy paprika-like pepper and warm, spicy woods. Almost an incense in it's dryness and non-foody quality. I do wish I'd gotten the milk and honey notes flannelman reports, as that sounds lovely as a counterpoint to the hot woods, but what I do get is still very enjoyable. It is definitely not a 'here I am' screamer, though. This hot spicy wood stays very close to the skin and people will have to be in your personal space to smell it. Which makes it more sexy, in my opinion; Body heat and this scent...hot indeed."", 'A very warm, interesting, unusual fragrance with a somewhat misleading name.  There is pepper, of course. White pepper. But it\'s definitely not ""piquant"", and for most of the (very short) longevity of the scent, it seems to only play a supporting role. The pepper is most noticeable in the very early top notes (together with an elusive note that reminds me of thyme, but not quite) and at this stage it really is very good indeed.  It is however quickly taken over by a soft, silky, milk and honey accord. The honey is just right: light and not too sweet. The milk seems to be mixed with spices, and at some times I was reminded of Chai.  The spices and pepper (when they emerge, from time to time) play hide and seek with the milk and honey and I find this to be very pleasantly orchestrated.  If only Poivre Piquant had a bit more longevity and sillage! It\'s gone way too quickly to be fully appreciated; that\'s a shame because it will stop many (including myself) from getting a full bottle.  Not a fragrance to wear when you want to be noticed, but great to relax at home on a freezing winter day...', '""Your bag smells lovely,"" the young girl said.  ""Umm, thanks,"" the boy replied. Compliments were not something that he was comfortable with receiving. As soon as the girl skipped off to join her friends across the playground, the young boy lifted his school bag and gave it a sniff. He supposed it did smell rather nice, in its own way. He opened the bag and buried his face inside. The smell was much more prominent so he closed his eyes and smiled a secret smile inside the darkness of the bag.  Only a pampered young boy could have just such a school bag with a half eaten pot of \'honey and Greek yoghurt, a split packet of pepper (for a salad that he threw away on the way to school), a half chewed lace of licorice and a broken-zipped pencil case stuffed with pencil shavings.

This perfume is one of my favourite in their range, it's so unusual and comforting. It's not really a perfume as such, I see it more as an olfactory painting.  A lot of people mention the work 'spicy' when talking about it. 'Piquant' in French means not as much spicy as prickly or original. The top note in Poivre Piquant is without doubt pepper, vibrating on the skin and in my nose. It is probably one of the most real rendition of freshly milled pepper I have met in perfumery. Pepper sprinkled all over equally freshly baked bread. As it develops, you get more sweetness coming from the honey and milk, and then a touch of liquorice kicks in. The image for me is the cosy, wooden kitchen, and a rustic breakfast made up of bread, butter, honey, and the pepper sprinkled on top.  It is not really a very foody or gourmand scent despite all the ingredients, and it is so addictive!  It has quite a good staying power too, on me is lasts a few hours and projects well."", 'This one is an amazing fragrance, smells like a sweet, spicy sandalwood, smooth, gentle, sweet but not overpowering, creamy, really nice underrated high quality pleasant fragrance, thumbs up for me', ""Think of this beauty as pink light in a bottle.

I tried this in a perfume bar in Rome (such a wonderful concept!) and immediately noticed the pepper. I think I categorized it as white pepper, slightly subtle and spicy, but in no way peppery 'piquant'. I liked it though, so did my partner. It was unlike the generic stuff I always smelled in drugstores. So even though I can't say I was smitten, I went ahead and bought it. That's what holidays in Rome are for :) Within a few days something strange happened. I suddenly picked up the licquorice, which is a smell/taste/product I can't stand. And I could never 'unsmell' it again. It was there from the very opening, untill the drydown hours later. Not as in spicy anis, but sharp, salty licquorice.  I was so bummed. My bottle has been left unused for years. But I kept on reading reviews from people experiencing this as milky, creamy yumm-ness. I wanted that!  Yesterday, I gave it another try. I've learned a little more about perfumery since I first bought Poivre Piquant and I hoped my slightly better trained nose could make something else out of this. I applied it (dabbed instead of sprayed!) and yup.. there was that sharp licquorice again. BUT.. after an hour or so some other notes did make it up to my brain. The licquorice is too prominent for me to distinguish what else I smelled, but yes there was the comfort that some others mention. Still, the licquorice is too much for me. So I think--after a retest--I'm ready to let this go now."", ""Not all l'artisant parfumeur fragrances are for me infortunately. I purchased it based on positive reviews here.

Poivre piquant is a little bit chemical for my tastes and gives an impression of a hospital atmosphere with white walls and medicinal smell. I know I'm not on the same wave with most of reviewers in the appreciation of this fragrance. But my review aims to prevent from blind buy. Test before buy.

A little bit of unnecessary back story, but this is *fragrance* so we tend to get wordy and romantic, let‚Äôs be honest. I had a bottle of this which I bought in‚Ä¶probably 2014 or 2015. My oldest son was 4 or 5 (and an only child at the time!), so although I purchased it primarily to complete my collection of Burberry, its intended use was for him. Though, it never really became ‚Äúhis‚Äù scent. He preferred Johnson and Johnson baby cologne, and his father preferred it on him as well. I‚Äôd still stubbornly sneak in a spritz on my son before bed after bath time here and there for my own enjoyment, but it was primarily a pretty decoration on his bathroom counter, next to his bubblegum mouthwash and red white and blue striped toothpaste. Outside of that bathroom, we had a reading nook and most nights he would sit on my lap and I‚Äôd read him a few stories before bed, but I‚Äôd usually wash my hands in his bathroom first as I‚Äôd likely just finished cooking dinner and cleaning the kitchen after he was fed. After I dried my hands, I‚Äôd wipe down his counter and see this pretty little rocking bottle with its pastel ribbon on top and all the kitsch that held this light, green, fuzzy-fresh scent. I‚Äôd spray my chest and inhale, meet him out in the furry chair and get reading, ready to go watch tv alone after the goodnight kisses. This scent reminds me initially of that bathroom. And then the chair, his bony butt on my lap. But it does not remind me of watching tv alone. The scent was long gone before then. But upon purchasing a second bottle very recently for my newborn son (and stealing two sprays for myself of course), I am noticing that IT DOES LAST. And it‚Äôs much more beautiful of a scent than I remember. Yes, it‚Äôs been discontinued since the last bottle so this one came with a premium price tag, but it‚Äôs not like I was paying more for something better!! Yesterday (around 4pm) we checked the mail, opened the box, I spritzed myself first. You know, to ensure no reactions, authenticity. Not that I had any doubt. But this is my baby here! So two sprays around 4, plenty of playing with baby, light housework, cooked dinner (a fragrant one of pasta, Italian sausage, red sauce, garlic), and a) this smell is so clean and fresh; I was heavily into gourmands back in the day and I still love them, but I didn‚Äôt appreciate this for what it is. It was so barely-there to me, almost indetectable. And b) IT LASTS. It‚Äôs now 6am and I still smell it on myself. And not just on my chest but on my hand, the hand i sprayed it on after bath time before rubbing it on my sons onesie-clad chest. Many hand washes later. I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs lasting so long, but even when I picked him up out of bed, despite being swaddled, I could still smell it on him. I don‚Äôt understand. This scent used to be water to me. A pointless purchase, just a luxury item that sat to look pretty and spoil my oldest. This time around, it‚Äôs something much different. Perhaps because of me, perhaps because of the bottle I received. Either way I am grateful.  And I‚Äôm also very mad it‚Äôs so hard to find/pricy when found that I can‚Äôt douse my own self in this every day. I want my son to have every drop‚Äîit fits his fun, innocent, friendly, sometimes sour personality perfectly. A bright little burst of fuzzy-headed energy. Even his father (a different man, thank goodness for divorce) loves it. He asked what our son needs cologne for. I said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a present, it‚Äôs nice, it‚Äôs not ‚Äòcologne.‚Äô‚Äù And he agrees. The mossy, fresh scent is a lovely change from the baby powder one is used to with a baby. It‚Äôs clean, light but noticeable, and definitely says ‚Äúbaby,‚Äù but in a unique way. No milk or vanilla detected here, never did notice many of the notes. Very strong of oak moss for sure, leafy and barely floral. Woodsy without the wood. Rainy and damp, at least to our noses. Granted, we live in the desert so we don‚Äôt see much rain or woods.

I have to practically douse myself with it to get anything just approaching the sillage of a regular perfume, and it wears off in hours; I do not recommend this for full work days or events.

In fact I now remember I stopped wearing it as it was so thickly enveloping n long lasting I got fed up with it. It's snowing here currently, I think it suits this weather, it's a cosy wrapping thing.."", 'I lived in a country without air conditioning for 3 hot summers and would drench myself in this stuff. Light, refreshing, airy clean smell. Like a shower in a bottle. Almost always got compliments.  Smells just like you\'ve stepped out of the bath. Think of how soap smells hang in the moist air after a shower‚Äì that. There is citrus in this, but orange not lemon, so without the common ""zing"" they can have. The milk/mint really mellow it out without being too loud. Yum.  I\'m happy with how it achieves that ""clean"" feel without the artificial aqua or detergent notes some \'clean\' scents can have! Definitely more green.  Zero longevity, sadly. Really wish I could find a similar one formulated to last like adult perfume. The wobbly bottle is so cute and fun. Not sure about spraying my baby with this (LOL) but do think it\'d be mild enough to wear while holding/caring for a baby.', ""I get a bright green citrusy short-lived opening. It evolves into the lily of the valley, cyclamen, and orangy sweetness before turning into a warm vanilla powdery skin scent. Perfect for the days that I just don't want to wear a sweet floral, but am not in the mood for a true aquatic or true green fragrance. Just right for the current pandemic situation of being at home and looking for comfort and coziness without being cloying or too heavy/heady."", 'I wanted SO badly to like this fragrance. Looking at the notes and description, I was hoping it might be a good choice for a post-shower fragrance, or a warm day outside. When I sprayed it, it was a very sharp citrus blast. As it dried down, I definitely for the lemon verbena (that is the strongest note for sure). But on me, it smells like what I would smell like if I had used a male\'s citrus based body wash in the shower. Not in a good, clean, soapy way, but in am annoying, lingering, kind of cheap scent way. ü§∑‚ôÄÔ∏è I would certainly call this unisex, if not a bit more masculine than feminine.

I still like it though for casual days because i just can't leave home without fragrance on. Best also for warmer days as the citrus tends to be more dominant. In cooler days it settles into a soft, creamy, slightly musky scent on me."", 'The Milk and Vanilla plays such major role in making this fragrance alot more beautiful and baby like. I LOVE the subtle creaminess and sweetness so much! ugh  I get why they called it citrus gourmand.  This smells so much like a baby without a doubt, which is why i live for this!  P.S. To those who plans to buy this, The alcohol free (green one) lasts longer and projects better!', ""Not one of my favorites of the Burberry fragrances, but pleasant none the less. A bit softer and weaker than I've grown accustomed to maybe more suitable for a fragrance beginner, someone younger, or more timid.

BTW it's light purple"", ""This stuff smells quite green at first and doesn't take long to go all soft clean and creamy. Soooo my speed. Just about anything with a dairy element is going to be good especially mixed with something unexpected, less gourmand. Because of the packaging I felt a little derp for getting this. I wondered if it really was intended for babies. I wore it to bed and ended up having a kind of waking dream about newborns and vernix caseosa. I've never smelled that stuff but it sounds intriguing and I wonder if BBT really does smell kind of similar. Idve worn it any way but I'm so glad this is intended for adults and unisex at that."", 'I\'ve had this for a while, both the green and light purple versions. It\'s what I wear when I\'m actively practicing self-care - not watching the news, logging off of social media, taking time to enjoy silence, etc. I think it would have been more aptly named ""Gentle Touch"" or ‚ÄúRefreshing Touch‚Äù instead of ""Baby Touch"". I smell no vanilla or milk. I\'ve had 3 children and the only thing about this that reminds me of a baby is how gentle and peaceful it is. I am a headache-prone person and this fragrance has never given me a problem.  It has an oxygen or clean air, ozonic note. This is the smell of an angel\'s halo. (I sometimes get annoyed when others wax poetic in reviews, but I just had to say that because it rings so true to me and keeps coming to my mind when I wear this. Maybe others will relate.)  I find its longevity to be on par with the original Elizabeth Arden Green Tea, if you are familiar with a scent spray like that, then you will know what to expect performance-wise. It has its time and its place and I hope to always have it on my perfume tray.', 'This is pretty, soft and fresh, great for warm days. It opens up quite green and crisp - maybe a bit too green briefly - before quickly settling down to a fresh and smooth citrus floral. Yes it\'s suggestive of the refresher towels you get in the foil packs. But it\'s a nicer version of that scent. I find the Ptisenbon and Tous Baby frags more like those towels than this is. Baby Touch dries down to a very pleasant, cosy base. The milk and vanilla do make it smell like a baby in the dry-down. I know my baby always seems to be soaked in milk somehow or other!  I do use this scent on my daughter (I have the alcohol-free version), and the Burberry website does state that it\'s intended ""for mothers and babies"". Gotta love the price too! Longevity and sillage are underwhelming though, but that makes me even more relaxed about using it on my daughter - I don\'t want her wafting in a heavy cloud of scent.', ""This is extremely green, so much so to the point that I wonder how it could be good for babies. It's like they took Johnson and Johnson baby cologne (the purplish blue one) and amped up the bitterness. I was hoping to use this as a body mist but there is no way this would mix with my chemistry to erase any harsh smells. Maybe I can use it as hair cologne."", ""This is really lovely, but it has one of the worst longevities I've ever known :( a few minutes and the scent is completely gone. It made me feel so young and clean while it lasted on my skin, but I couldn't be spraying it 50 times a day to keep it. Maybe it works better on baby skin. Pretty similar to Baby Tous: orange blossom and sheer citrusy but still warm and sweet, very wearable for teens and young adults, too."", 'Light lemony scent.

But I also think that there is some kind of... cigarette note (in a good way!).. if you know what i mean. Its kind of sharpy, which makes this perfume not only softy and sweet (otherwise it really would be too childish).

Love it."", ""Just blind bought this and it's marvellous. It's not what I was expecting from the notes list but never mind. I can't detect any orange. Mostly this reminds me of Diesel Plus Feminine, with a bit of powdery iris. It actually does dry down to remind you of baby head kind of smell, although it's not really warm or animal enough. It's like extra freshly washed baby. Overall very soft, kind and fluffy. If you miss Diesel, this will comfort you. I absolutely love it! 5 stars!

This has nothing ""baby"" about it, first of all. It does not smell like a baby nor it is designed to be used for babies. For sure. This is one very fresh, spicy, soapy cologne like fragrance. Unisex, yeah, but slightly more feminine than masculine.  It smells of freshly washed laundry, cotton sheets perhaps :-). A bit sharp, citrusy at first, but settles down soon enough, when it\'s mostly moss I can detect. It is not sweet at all, vanilla is nowhere to be detected and I would never describe it as powdery. It\'s clean, fresh, spicy and very neutral in regard to gender, age or occasion. However, I think it is ideal for summer time, hot humid weather and casual occasions. It very much reminds me of Gap\'s Washed cotton, as in - they leave the same impression. Sillage - soft, longevity - weak. Shame, since I really like it.', ""This scent reminds me of Angel's breath cologne back when I was in kindergarten. It smells really good, but I think the sillage and longevity of its scent is weak to last for the whole day. I love the sweet base note of vanilla and milk, which makes it smell like an innocent one. It doesn't smell strong even at first spray, much more when it dissipates as time goes on. How I wish it could smell stronger than it is."", 'I love the scent and am very pleased that I made a good choice without ever smelling it.', ""This was a disappointing blind buy for me.

I wouldn't describe this as sweet at all."", ""I received this in a wonderful swap and it has turned out to be something I really really like! It starts off very sharp and green and citrusy on me. Within minutes it turns into a soft powdery sweet vanilla-ish scent. Like many others have said I do get a clean baby scent but more so I get a fresh laundry scent-makes me think of freshly washed sheets that have hung outside in the sun to dry. Silage is light. Others around me can smell it if they are close by but not from across the room. Is definitely work friendly. Lasting power isn't too bad for an EDT. Sprayed it at 730 this morning and almost 3 hours later it still smells just as strong to me. Very nice!!"", ""I love powdery scents and I also own a few fragrances from Burberry, so after reading reviews and suggestions for this fragrance...I blind bought it.

It's clean, sweet and simple, and I think the sillage isn't bad and it lasts about 3-4 hours.

I don't get citrus at all in any way, I really like this scent though I've only wore it during spring / summer it lovely fresh and suitable for office wear, running about after the kids any where really can't imagine bugging anyone in this lovely scent!

A soft delicate smell, not baby really, fresh & clean then the citrus came which then turned into a kind of Spanish cologne sort of smell.

I didn't get any orange but it could be that I'm just so used to certain scents in baby products that I can't distinguish it. What's really interesting about it is that it smells like the best part of Johnson's baby powder without the powder element.  Once the floral tones fade out, it's a comforting, not too sweet base. It's really an interesting scent. Like I said, very soothing, comforting, & nostalgic but fresh and innocent at the same time.  That being said, I can't see anyone above mid-teens wearing this regularly and it's too floral (nevermind inappropriate) to put on babies.

A little bit of unnecessary back story, but this is *fragrance* so we tend to get wordy and romantic, let‚Äôs be honest. I had a bottle of this which I bought in‚Ä¶probably 2014 or 2015. My oldest son was 4 or 5 (and an only child at the time!), so although I purchased it primarily to complete my collection of Burberry, its intended use was for him. Though, it never really became ‚Äúhis‚Äù scent. He preferred Johnson and Johnson baby cologne, and his father preferred it on him as well. I‚Äôd still stubbornly sneak in a spritz on my son before bed after bath time here and there for my own enjoyment, but it was primarily a pretty decoration on his bathroom counter, next to his bubblegum mouthwash and red white and blue striped toothpaste. Outside of that bathroom, we had a reading nook and most nights he would sit on my lap and I‚Äôd read him a few stories before bed, but I‚Äôd usually wash my hands in his bathroom first as I‚Äôd likely just finished cooking dinner and cleaning the kitchen after he was fed. After I dried my hands, I‚Äôd wipe down his counter and see this pretty little rocking bottle with its pastel ribbon on top and all the kitsch that held this light, green, fuzzy-fresh scent. I‚Äôd spray my chest and inhale, meet him out in the furry chair and get reading, ready to go watch tv alone after the goodnight kisses. This scent reminds me initially of that bathroom. And then the chair, his bony butt on my lap. But it does not remind me of watching tv alone. The scent was long gone before then. But upon purchasing a second bottle very recently for my newborn son (and stealing two sprays for myself of course), I am noticing that IT DOES LAST. And it‚Äôs much more beautiful of a scent than I remember. Yes, it‚Äôs been discontinued since the last bottle so this one came with a premium price tag, but it‚Äôs not like I was paying more for something better!! Yesterday (around 4pm) we checked the mail, opened the box, I spritzed myself first. You know, to ensure no reactions, authenticity. Not that I had any doubt. But this is my baby here! So two sprays around 4, plenty of playing with baby, light housework, cooked dinner (a fragrant one of pasta, Italian sausage, red sauce, garlic), and a) this smell is so clean and fresh; I was heavily into gourmands back in the day and I still love them, but I didn‚Äôt appreciate this for what it is. It was so barely-there to me, almost indetectable. And b) IT LASTS. It‚Äôs now 6am and I still smell it on myself. And not just on my chest but on my hand, the hand i sprayed it on after bath time before rubbing it on my sons onesie-clad chest. Many hand washes later. I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs lasting so long, but even when I picked him up out of bed, despite being swaddled, I could still smell it on him. I don‚Äôt understand. This scent used to be water to me. A pointless purchase, just a luxury item that sat to look pretty and spoil my oldest. This time around, it‚Äôs something much different. Perhaps because of me, perhaps because of the bottle I received. Either way I am grateful.  And I‚Äôm also very mad it‚Äôs so hard to find/pricy when found that I can‚Äôt douse my own self in this every day. I want my son to have every drop‚Äîit fits his fun, innocent, friendly, sometimes sour personality perfectly. A bright little burst of fuzzy-headed energy. Even his father (a different man, thank goodness for divorce) loves it. He asked what our son needs cologne for. I said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a present, it‚Äôs nice, it‚Äôs not ‚Äòcologne.‚Äô‚Äù And he agrees. The mossy, fresh scent is a lovely change from the baby powder one is used to with a baby. It‚Äôs clean, light but noticeable, and definitely says ‚Äúbaby,‚Äù but in a unique way. No milk or vanilla detected here, never did notice many of the notes. Very strong of oak moss for sure, leafy and barely floral. Woodsy without the wood. Rainy and damp, at least to our noses. Granted, we live in the desert so we don‚Äôt see much rain or woods. But this is what we know of it üòä', ""I've tried one sprizt yesterday, in a hurry, before leaving the store, just out of curiosity. I kept on sniffing my arm, I fell in love with it. It's the perfect scent if you want to smell clean without smelling like fabric softener. It smells like clean skin, like moisturizer and baby powder. Innocent and fresh. i think it would be perfect for school or for work if you have to share your office room with other people, 'cause it won't offend anybody. My skin usually eats perfumes, but I could still smell that only one spritz even 3hrs later. I'm seriously thinking about buying it... EDIT: I've bought it online! can't wait to get it! I'll write a better review after I'll be using it."", 'I\'ve had this for a while, both the green and light purple versions. It\'s what I wear when I\'m actively practicing self-care - not watching the news, logging off of social media, taking time to enjoy silence, etc. I think it would have been more aptly named ""Gentle Touch"" or ‚ÄúRefreshing Touch‚Äù instead of ""Baby Touch"". I smell no vanilla or milk. I\'ve had 3 children and the only thing about this that reminds me of a baby is how gentle and peaceful it is. I am a headache-prone person and this fragrance has never given me a problem.  It has an oxygen or clean air, ozonic note. This is the smell of an angel\'s halo. (I sometimes get annoyed when others wax poetic in reviews, but I just had to say that because it rings so true to me and keeps coming to my mind when I wear this. Maybe others will relate.)  I find its longevity to be on par with the original Elizabeth Arden Green Tea, if you are familiar with a scent spray like that, then you will know what to expect performance-wise. It has its time and its place and I hope to always have it on my perfume tray.', 'funny story- saw this perfume and honestly thought that the baby scent was a cute idea. even if i didnt like it it was an asset to my collection. i came home and put it on. it was wonderful, just like the smell of baby. so i came home and i let my mom smell this ""baby in a bottle"" she really enjoyed the scent and since she works in an office that has banned fragrances i knew that this would be perfect. i then purchased her a bottle. a week later i purchesed two bottles one for a baby shower i am going to.one for if i ever run out because it is a hard scent to find. its a very well made scent that last a long time considering its to be worn around baby. it starts off with moss, and a bit of mint, the vanilla starts to develop with the milk to smooth it down. its truely wonderful.', 'I wanted SO badly to like this fragrance. Looking at the notes and description, I was hoping it might be a good choice for a post-shower fragrance, or a warm day outside. When I sprayed it, it was a very sharp citrus blast. As it dried down, I definitely for the lemon verbena (that is the strongest note for sure). But on me, it smells like what I would smell like if I had used a male\'s citrus based body wash in the shower. Not in a good, clean, soapy way, but in am annoying, lingering, kind of cheap scent way. ü§∑‚ôÄÔ∏è I would certainly call this unisex, if not a bit more masculine than feminine. As for some of the descriptions arguing that this is supposed to smell like a newborn baby, I totally disagree. It is a solid ""no"" from me.', 'god by no means this is for babies! or for any human being since this is a strong disgusting cleaning product smell, finally tested bit today since I loved the bottle and the notes but totally disappointed! dont blind buy this!', 'I don\'t feel milky and vanilla smells. it\'s not baby smell, just lush smell. Just feel strong fresh vervena smell and always feel this kind of...it\'s not my favourite perfume. First, I take ""pourto A heliotrope"" perfume after take baby touch when I take this perfume. Then become good smell...like a baby smell.']"

On a strip, it smells exactly like the glossy pages of a fashion magazine, the kind you\'d find on a table at the hair salon with the little fragrance samples tucked in the pages. Inky, dry, and glossy.  On my skin unfortunately green aromatic notes just disappear, so I got none of the basil in the open, nor any magnolia or orange blossom. Just more ""dry ink,"" maybe a hint of the mace in the throat plus the base notes coming through strong for me with incense and amber already which my skin tends to amplify. After 20-30 seconds a generic ""floral"" started to come through, maybe a mix of rose and jasmine but was hard to place - didn\'t really detect the tea-like notes of clary sage or freesia. After about 10 minutes I was strongly getting incense and amber, not too much woodiness of the cedar or birch, not too much spiciness of patchouli. At this point a sweeter powderiness started coming through as well which I don\'t get along well with and was a little nauseating, so I had to scrub it off. Never got the cardamom.

Such a strange assortment of notes it's no surprise that it doesn't actually smell like any of them individually. The blend becomes its own new thing. The basil and pimento combination reads to my nose as some pickled vegetable, but quickly shifts to other aspects... what I imagine must be the angelica and immortelle because it gives a dusty herbal quality to the composition. Dries down to the typical DNA of almost all Comme des Garcons scents. The woody backbone I've come to associate with this brand. By no means an unpleasant scent, yet I struggle to conceive who the right person or what the right occasion would be for this. I might recommend this to someone who loves aromatics but is easily bored and wants something unique.

I will say that the florals aren't as strong as the greens, but the effect, for me, is still so balanced and reminiscent of gardens and florist shops that I'm thrilled to smell it. it does fade to be pretty skin-close and gentle, so if you're looking for a big, long-lasting projector, this isn't it. but it also never loses its balance or strays into something I don't like. my favorite daytime scent I've ever had."", 'Grassy/sweet light woody incense.

So I get fresh bright frankinsence type top notes even a hint of juniper the heart is slightly peppery and herbal then a woody drydown. It's an odd fragrance and does have that cellophane, synthetic, new magazine, ink print smell to it. To me though it's quite warm and woody and comes across quite natural.

It's very loud and present in the beginning, the scent goes through 3 olfactory phases to eventually fade away to a very soft fragrance after about 3 to 4 hours, then it stays very close to the skin.

And thats a reason for me to really like Comme des Garcons fragrances. While I fell immidietly in love with CdG 1, this one is more of a shy one... At first it smells a lot of green pepper on me, and I find it a bit confusing but very fresh, wet and ripe. Luckyly it come off quite fast and are replaced with subtile notes of toff√©, cream, different woods and some citrus... each of them comes and goes... Wakes my curiosity. Unfortunatly the fragrance is a bit weak and hard to catch, I can¬¥t wait to try this in the summer. :)', ""Hard to describe this fragrance. To me it replicates the experience of sticking my nose inside a brand new magazine. Glossy paper, fresh ink and glue.  (Another reviewer also mentioned glue, so I guess it's not just my imagination.) That being said, I love it."", ""You never see this one anywhere in the UK even in shops which have a comprehensive selection of Comme des garcons fragrances. Luckily I found it in the CdG perfume shop in Paris and my word is 3 the epitome of this houses fragrances(?) It's strangely aloof, avant garde and yet inviting. I can see how some of the fragrances from this house can leave people cold (especially this one) but I embrace the oddity and love to challenge my nose. So I get fresh bright frankinsence type top notes even a hint of juniper the heart is slightly peppery and herbal then a woody drydown. It's an odd fragrance and does have that cellophane, synthetic, new magazine, ink print smell to it. To me though it's quite warm and woody and comes across quite natural. I may just have a soft spot for CdG, Mark Buxton's creativity and will forgive them pretty much anything. It has an incense signature to it though and I love that about many of their fragrances, it's certainly not boring. Modern and not for everyone but I enjoyed it, performance was average and longevity was not so good."", 'I love the review that calls this scent ""Ode to Pencil Sharpeners""! It had not occurred to my nose the similarities until I read that review. Kudos! Of course while pencil sharpener is mixed in there I love this fragrance. The basil cleans up the pencil mess. I do not get any floral on me.  This is a unisex keeper. It is unique but not obtuse. It is not loud so office appropriate. I would say projection is moderate. I would recommend trying it to anyone.', 'Aromatic and unique. The opening was strangely masculine, from one side ""Comme des Garcons 3"" delivers masculine aromatic spices and on the other there is a bunch of very sweet notes slightly resembling industrial glue. Very soon it settles to a skin scent of a rather pleasant woody unisex scent. Even though I did like the opening, the lack of development and staying power (3 hours) dissapoints me. Worth a try for the first hour expierence, but not worthy of full bottle in my opinion.', 'I have entered into a florist‚Äôs, fresh green, fleshy flowers, some ‚Äòbad breath‚Äô from lilies and white flowers, from the remains of stalks swimming in buckets of water. There is much sharp freshness, and also a vegetal staleness that gets stronger as temperature and humidity rise. Or it might be a greenhouse, humming with plant and insect life and gardening chemicals, a bit sweltering, a bit threatening. After 30 minutes it loses much of its intensity. Green and floral, as if innocently poisonous. The slighly floral, nymphish trail it leaves is gorgeous until the third hour, after that, it has lost its juice and ends up a bit dusty-musty. A livielier vetiver in the base would have remedied that. Buy only if you‚Äôre willing to reapply. It‚Äôs very nice. Daytime spring wear and summer evenings. I would prefer to smell this on a man, but it‚Äòs very much unisex.', 'Just ordered a sample from luckyscent I love the concept, will update if I love the smell as well. :) Update: Bleck! XP, me no likey it smells like piney arm pits on my skin! ick least I only got a itty bitty vial && not a whole bottle...']"

Older style bottle right before the change.  Of course I was surprised . Blind bought it at a really good price. This does smell exactly like a bell pepper very realistic. The best part is when a light chocolate emerges and blends so well with the chili pepper. It's quite nice but a bit light for me but it does last. It smells expensive for a vegetable garden scent. You are not going to smell this down at the pub on a Saturday night."", ""Vegetal green chili peppers mixed with ripened cocoa pods. Gets more dark chocolatey as it wears on the skin, a touch spicier. If you're expecting Mexican chocolate, this is not it.  Perfect for cool/warmish weather, so spring and autumn.  Wears just above skin."", 'Straight up like biting into a green bell pepper. I actually like the smells of fresh produce on me, i.e. before they\'re cooked and you get a less fresh, stickier smell.

Lovely fragrance and my very first niche perfume ever, many moons ago!', ""This smells like pepper chutney and that's not what I am about in my perfume game :D"", 'As a conceptual fragrance, this one hits the mark. Somewhere between a red bell and chili pepper for me, not too spicy or nose tingling. An easy-going, warm and gourmand scent.', 'This is an odd one on me. It smells like crushed fresh green peppers on top of a slightly sweet, vanillary base. Very fresh, herbal, as in kitchen herbs top layer. I cannot detect the cacao and the other spices are barely noticeable. It takes about 6h before the top calms down and a touch of cacao emerges. Its perhaps too cold a weather to really get this one to come out of its shell - I shall continue exploring. But definitely out of the norm which is always a plus.', 'For those that never hunted discontinued fragrances I‚Äôm here to tell you that 70% of scents that got a pulled off are lost cause and could be a big disappointment and I say this out of experience  I‚Äôve been interested in the brand lately and in my part of the world this house is very hard to find there is no trace whatsoever except a couple of bottles in the grey market When I saw it online I was skeptical I mean chilly peppers how accurate can the note be After searching I found out the perfumer and I trust his work Had to blind buy a bottle and I was fascinated  This scent is heaven to spicy scents lovers  The interpretation of the pepper is perfect  Which stays in the majority of the scents life cycle  in the depth of it you can feel a hint of sweetness very little it might be untraceable  Which is linked with some kind of butteriness that is rare to smell as well This one is an original gourmand a perfect piece of art that was neglected by the consumers to buy something less challenging like sauvage if you like spicy scents give it a try if you can find it  It‚Äôs a work of art in a time where mainstream is the dream Performance was above average projection is good', 'Fresh, peppery, spicy, uplifting, original perfume, with a bit of sweetness in the background. Unfortunately it is discontinued.', ""This chili-centered scent needs a bit of sweetness, in my opinion. As an avid spicy food champion, what I've always loved about any type of chili is the combination of spicy, fresh, and gingerly sweet notes. This specific aroma made me pursue the perfect hot pepper fragrance for years.  I can appreciate the beauty of Piment Brulant, but it just doesn't strike me as likable or personable. It seems not to tell the story of its notes as soulfully as I wished.  Happy and contented with my 5ml decant, but even twice as happy that it didn't turn out to be yet another discontinued fragrance from L'artisan parfumeur that I passionately hunt down for thrice the price. My bank account is relieved. EDIT: Nevermind, I‚Äôll be buying a full bottle. Turns out in this case less is more and somehow I was happy to feel the scent on me all throughout the day."", ""It starts off very green - like bell pepper and I thought I wasn't going to like it. But oh, what a transformation! It's like the chili ripened right under my nose. Red chili and dark chocolate mix luxuriously. Beautiful, beautiful pairing. There's the slightest smokey streak. After hours, it was still there, warm, spicy, comforting. I wouldn't call this a gourmand, it's not sweet and the vanilla never takes center stage. I would call it perfect, though. I am in love with this fragrance. Nothing but compliments and requests to sniff.  The chili gives it a heat that I usually get with patchouli. But it's not cloying and doesnt overpower the more subtle notes like patchouli will do. It's crisp and warm and plays nice with everything. I highly recommend this."", 'The opening is like a dewy, whole chili pepper, perhaps hanging right on the plant. It seems at first more like a green pepper, but it becomes like a bouquet of red green and yellow capsicum. This isn‚Äôt so much the broken flesh of the pepper- I feel myself smelling my wrist the way I try to drag out the fresh scent of a pepper from its surface. It is understated. It isn‚Äôt a burning spice, but a living, almost tomato-vine like fresh warmth.  As it dries down this scent reminds me of a late summer afternoon, with the sunlight hitting tomatoes and peppers sitting fresh in the kitchen bowl. This scent has such poetry, it is something so inviting, and expertly captures a pure fresh chili scent profile that could be taken for granted in its subtlety. It dissipates quickly and does not last on my skin for longer than an hour but my skin seems to eat up scents. Regardless of performance this is such a worthy olfactory experience and i believe this will conjure up some fond memories.  I would wear this to add a punch to a jaunt to the farmers market, or spray before bed or after a shower to be invigorated. This also could work as a great brunch or outdoor dinner scent with family or friends. However, it‚Äôs true power lies in a moment between just you and the aroma. I don‚Äôt think this meant to be powerhouse, rather a subtle poetically nuanced scent with the power to uplift.', 'This is unmistakably chili-centered, and yet it is by no means a gimmicky scent. In fact, it is utterly wearable and an instant mood lifter and very invigorating. I wear this often when I work from home and want to be productive, as to me its effect is very similar to that of a good cup of espresso. The chili used here is red, not green, and freshly harvested. You can in fact smell some dirt, some roots and an accord that smells like the plants that grew in its vicinity, like tomato leaf and basil. What an underrated classic!', 'Big double-take on the Notes pyramid- Piment Brulant registers very differently on my skin. It\'s pleasant and I like it- it just doesn\'t smell like the suggested notes. This conjures fond memories of my Parents\' house back in Japan. There\'s something very ""Japanese"" ambiance to me- namely Tatami mats. Looking back at my reviews, I\'d mentioned Tatami mats 3 times: ELDO\'s Fat Electrician, Baraonda, and Io Non Ho Mani Che Mi Accarezzino il Volto. I believe a certain combo of 1) Vetiver, 2) Sandalwood, and 3) ""Woodsy notes"" registers this way for me.', ""This is easily one of my favorite purchases that I have ever made. It takes me back to my childhood somehow and makes me smile.  The chili is always present in the scent from start to finish. Its a kind of fleshy chili scent on top with a floral backbone and a very small hint of fresh cacao. I think like a Hispanic fresh foods mixed with my backyard garden that i grew up with as a kid, if that had a smell. Not sweet and highly floral on my skin, but I don't care I love it none the less. Piment Brulant last a long time on me but the projection is very light, but that makes it good in just about any situation because it wont offend anyone.  I also have to note that I don't like fresh and light scents of the get go. It usually takes time for me to like them but I loved this from the day I got it. gold cap here.  I'll look into the scents starsnek suggested because these chili scents seem to be up my ally and a nice change of pace from what I usually wear. Dame does have some good stuff like Mexican vanilla."", ""It would be SO helpful if people would say if they are reviewing the black cap or gold cap bottles.  I have the gold, brand new in box, blind bought based on the notes, and all I get is a fresh chili pepper with a nondescript floral in the background. It's simple with no spice other than chili, no warmth, vanilla, or sweet notes at all!  I love Amour Nocturne and Deliria (all purchased from the same site) but this is very flat. Perfectly unisex, anyone can smell like veggies. Not offensive, just not much of anything! A true disappointment. The novelty of the fresh chili pepper note is the only thing keeping me from hating this completely. What happened to all those missing notes? Is it too old? I'm so sad;( UPDATE 12 hours later I still detect the note of fresh chili."", ""Upgrading from like to love on this hot summer day where this unique chilli pepper really shines and refreshes. Update on the potency. 6 hours after spraying on my arms, my wife smelt her hands and trying to recall if she was cutting chilli while cooking, then we realized she was just holding my arm where I sprayed this fragrance 6 hours ago. That's strong chilli power."", 'I don\'t get much pepper here, mostly powdery poppy (which is not unique and quite typical ""poppy"" fragrance you can find in cosmetics or other perfumes like Jo Malone) and dry green spicy notes, reminding me a bit of Etra and Dzongkha. It\'s definitely a warm weather perfume for me, sits close to skin and not very long lasting.  I definitely expected more and glad I didn\'t blind buy a bottle.', 'A most unusual fragrance and looking at the reviews below, appears it smells very different depending on who is wearing. For me I get a blast of chili peppers, not much else. Quite pleasant but probably not something you would wear on a date or in the office. I have the original version (gold top, red stripe) , but doesn‚Äôt last too long on me.', ""Piment Brulant smells very green to me. I do not detect any chocolate. This is a spicy, green fragrance. It's very nice. But if you are expecting a copy of Mexican Cocoa, this is not it. Piment Brulant stands on it's own. It's not sweet. This would be a great fragrance for Spring and Summer."", ""dark chocolate with red chilli pepper  it is very cozy, soft and warming scent. I'd say it is unique and would work well with other fragrances."", ""Pretty, green vegetal. Perfect for Valentine's Day with its red peppers. Reminds me of a Jo Malone, which is a compliment. It's fresh and natural smelling. The sweetness comes from the cut stems, not from vanilla, cacao, or amber. It's a light perfume and one that I only get about three hours of performance out of. Don't expect this to last all day. Great for Valentine's Day, springtime, and people who enjoy Jo Malone."", 'This is niche how it should be - imaginative, edgy, interesting concept that sparks imagination.  It is a summer-spring scent - clean and watery, light.  You can immediately detect the fresh peperoncino sitting on a cocoa pod, with supporting power of abstract poppy flower (straight from Flower by Kenzo minus the powder) and kept in check by warm musk and pale amber.  Very likeable, could be a cologne scent for both females and males. I really like the drydown though: vanilla-amber-musk. It creates a warm and cozy aura that wakes me up the next morning (I often spray neck hairline too, so shower rarely affects it) and it means a Chanel-like longevity.  It also means that it is a perfect year-round scent, especially for people who like to have it clean and professional without being boring.', 'The smell of a freshly sliced green pepper, with some musk and spices. I barely can get some vanilla and cinnamon in the drydown. No cacao on my skin. This is a very weak scent in terms of projection and longevity. It is a skin scent after a few minutes. I poured 2 mls on my skin, the whole vial. I guess this scent have some lovers out there but I find it difficult to understand. If a green pepper smell with poor projection is your thing, go for it! But..this is not for me.', 'Green pepper + Cayenne+ Chocolate.  You must ready for a ride with this scent. ...spray cautiously. The bite of this can be felt in the back of your throat and nose. Makes the nose tingle if not prepared. I hold my breath and spray the insides/outsides of my elbows generously and leave the room before inhaling. The green pepper spicy scent to me is very sensual and attention grabbing. Not for the floral or gourmand lover. If you enjoy or appreciate tomato leaf/ garden or spicy scents you will probably be drawn to this one. To me, this is easily fully bottle worthy but not necessarily a signature scent. it makes me smile. My nickname from a former lover was ...sriracha.......so... Wish it lasted longer on my skin....I reapply when wearing', ""First off- this performs like an eau de cologne on me.  This reminds me a lot of Sarah Jessica Parker's 'Covet'. They both have that subtley sweet Dark Chocolate and greenness, but Piment Brulant is lighter, less sweet, and spicier obviously. They feel like they are in the same lineage.  Literally smells like freshly chopped red peppers and a bar of like an 80% cacao chocolate bar w a hint of clove. Amber , musk, vanilla, and cinnamon are nowhere to be found which would have added complexity and staying power....Very interesting frag and the red pepper note gives a teeny tingling sensation.  Ill be going in w extra sprays on this one. Maybe a really hot day will bring out those missing notes. I was really hoping for that Mexican Spiced Hot Chocolate vibe and sadly was let down but its a uniquely fresh frag in the end."", ""New to the site and guess the best place to begin is with sharing my favourite scents. Piment Brulant? This is magical. I mean, for me, it is one of the most interesting and unusual scents I've experienced - love at first smell: vegetal, deep pepper, as when roasted, skin off and charred, the coco depth and spice of chilli had me rapt. After a couple of hours, the base notes kick in, mild vanilla, musk and poppy. That deep red piment note remains and this is a scent that you'll wake up with next morning still clinging to the wrist. It's an earthy, rich and sexy gourmand"", ""Ingenious and so fresh! That bright, crisp, spicy red pepper with dark chocolate creates an almost savory umami essence and it's perfectly balanced with the warm hint of vanilla in the base. The poppy, floral essence shines throughout keeping it from becoming too foody. Brilliant! I am experimenting with layering this one when I want to bring the caliente to my lighter, musky, florals! Practical considerations: Sillage and longevity are fairly weak as with most ALP."", ""Love this one! Reminds me just a little of DSH Piment et Chocolat. I love the Chili powder kick! Spicy, deep, rich, and warm. The chocolate sends it over the top in a good way. Considering when Piment Brulant was released, it was quite daring. Typical of L'Artisan. I've loved this for years and will continue to love it for many more. On the whole, L'Artisan frags don't have the greatest longevity, however, this one lasts on me for up to twelve hours. It becomes a skin scent after that. Love it, love it!"", 'Just notified that this was one of the fragrances L‚ÄôArtisan is discontinuing, so I hurriedly bought another bottle. I have had this perfume for quite a few years, wear it a while, get tired of it, then start up again when the weather first turns chilly. I don‚Äôt get what so many regard as a bell pepper scent, since I abhor bell peppers. No, it‚Äôs a nice spicy chilie pepper or pink peppercorn with a dash of cocoa, dry but not powdery. Not exactly Gardeny, but not typically perfumey either. All I know is that I like it enough to grab a backup, which is something I almost never do. I wear almost exclusively gourmands, usually on the sweet or fruity side. Although PB is in no way sweet, it still flirts with being a gourmand, and is one exception I‚Äôm happy to have in my collection', ""Smells like green onions and freshly cut grass with rotting flowers. This fragrance is very waxy smelling and pungent to the point of disgust. Not my thing, try again L'Artisan!"", ""After reading reviews I was expecting a 'greener' fragrance, and although the opening is indeed just like a freshly cut bell or chilli pepper, after some time I get an ongoing and quite deep 'red' spicy scent. Chilli pepper and cinnamon mostly, rounded with lower notes of the cacao and dark chocolate. I find these override the amber and vanilla which seem to play a supporting role rather than being detectable to my admittedly very novice nose. I really enjoy it. I love cooking and am always happy to smell gourmands, especially unusual (to me) ones like this.  I'm not bothered about projection, I wear scents for my enjoyment, but I'll report that this one certainly doesn't shout. Nor does it last all day/night. I've got a nice, well blended skin-scent now after a few hours of putting it on. I'd happily add a few more sprays next time.  I can't help re. comparing with Cassis en Feuille. But I did notice a similarity with the violet/violet leaf notes in DSquared He wood cologne which I've worn a few times lately.  Altogether a very nice fragrance from a house that seems to me adventurous and creative."", 'in Bed (Le Lit) by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ mortelle : christopher frank +++++++++++++', ""All the references to tomato stem and tomato plant make me think of Miller Harris' Cassis en Feuille; does anyone know if they smell similar?"", ""Opens with the rosey-crisp scent of a freshly cut red bell pepper. Drydown is subtly lovely, albeit a bit sweet for my taste, dominated by creamy poppy-chocolate-vanilla-amber, though the spices keep it from being cloying. The sweetness might be better on me in cooler weather. I'm impressed by the way these disparate notes come together."", ""Red Chlli Pepper - check. Vanilla - check (a little) Fresh - check Unique - check Anything else - meh Awesome scent - I ummed and ahhed about blind buying this one for so long. Finally took the plunge - not disappointed - exactly what I expected and classic L'Artisan. I find all the negative reviews here hard to fathom. Don't let people tell you it smells just like a garden or vegetables - whilst this may be the case it blends together to sit as a wearable perfume in its own right. I found when I suggested what it was or what the notes were people were then like - oh yeah - otherwise they thought it was just an awesome perfume! I think most notes here are complimentary but to me it really does smell like Red Chillli and vanilla. Don't get the Cacao. Amazing how well this captures a fresh cut Chilli Pepper at first. Awesome buy - for male (casual) or female (professional or casual - infact I think it is very sexy on a woman). Was a conversation starter at work (as was Comptoir Sud Pacifique Souffle Des Indes) - not that it will necessarily get you noticed but once my colleagues sampled it they were amazed such creations existed. Another one for the niche shelf for when I need a change of pace."", 'This fragrance is rather linear in a sense that I can only smell green peppers and no other notes. It smells like the inside of the pepper where all the seeds are. On the other hand it also smells humid and green (not at all bright green) and it reminds me of my fathers greenhouse where he grew tomatoes, purple grapes and cucumbers. It has a similar musty, stuffy green scent found in greenhouses. I enjoy this scent but it\'s so linear it would be boring to wear it an entire day. Therefore I am combining with other fragrances.  Zadig & Voltaires This is her on top of Piment Brulant creates a ""wild blackberry in a mossy forest"" scent.', 'Piment Brulant lets me think I\'m still a gardener. Haven\'t worked the soil for several years but still avidly peruse the seed catalogs every winter and stroll through the garden centers each spring. In my mind I\'m growing several varieties of tomatoes and peppers which end up in glorious salads and delicious grilled summer meals. Piment Brulant is going outside to the garden early in the morning with a cup of coffee in hand and bending to pick the weeds that have popped up overnight. It\'s crushing the leaves of pepper and tomato between my fingers and inhaling the aromas of spring, summer, salad and the gods and goddesses of plenty. Don\'t expect ""perfume"" or you\'ll be disappointed, as many reviewers state they have been. Expect the fragrance of a sunny roadside market stall filled with the ripe goodness of a vegetable garden well-nurtured and Mother Nature\'s promise of colorful, tasty and nutritious salads enjoyed outdoors with loving friends and family. To my nose and to coworkers sniffing Piment Brulant on me, there\'s absolutely no chocolate, no cinnamon, no clove...nothing shown in the pyramid above but peppers. Chile peppers, green bell peppers, ripe red bell peppers, and a background scent of tomato. More like a Demeter experience than a L\'Artisan creation, but a lovely surprise nonetheless.

When I apply this, I have an immediate and physical reaction - I sweat! My brow beads and I have the same reaction as if I had just snapped open a frightfully hot pepper, the seeds wriggling and writhing under my nose looking to create mischief. This is always such an unexpected note in perfumery, and here it is blended with cocoa drawing to mind the mexican hot chocolate recipes of antiquity. There is a tomato leaf or other green-stem note that with the capsicim peppers creates the predominant vegetal vibe. This makes it appear very fresh, ideal for the springtime and bright brisk early summer days when the sun shines but the air is still crisp. My personal taste is not for gourmand or bright or sweet or vegetal scents so this is something I wear so infreuqently, but I can see how this perfume would exhalt someone whose friends describe them as a ray of sunshine, someone youthful and vibrant who uplifts those around them but who is too enigmatic to smell how anyone else around them might.', 'Well, this one has me stumped. This was a free sample with purchase, one I requested specifically for its notes as I have a thing for chocolate scents. All I can say is that if I‚Äôd purchased a full bottle based on the notes, I‚Äôd be feeling pretty ripped off right about now, and pretty damn angry. I don‚Äôt get any chocolate or vanilla or amber or musk. There‚Äôs a weird, sharp note, like a crushed tomato plant stem. I get a bit of the chili pepper with a faint hint of a (very old) cinnamon stick and some dusty old cloves ‚Äì ones that have escaped from the packet and have been sitting in the bottom of the spice rack forever ‚Äì and that‚Äôs it. And after a couple of minutes, the scent is completely gone. I‚Äôve re-applied three times, thinking maybe it was just weak and I needed to put on a bit more, but nope. I‚Äôd love to see what this is like on someone else, but on me, it‚Äôs just, well, nothing. I can‚Äôt even smell enough in this to make a call as to whether I like it or not ‚Äì there‚Äôs just nothing there. Thinking it was maybe my skin chemistry, I asked my husband to try this one, and he could barely smell anything either, so maybe it is simply a bad sample. It‚Äôs a shame, because the notes in this all look so good. Definitely try before you buy. If I get the chance to try another sample and it‚Äôs different, I‚Äôll update my review.', ""Definitely feel the chilli pepper bell pepper, and nice amber and chocolate (I can't smell cinnamon) and at first it's uniqueness was attractive. I will not however be buying a bottle either as it does have that fresh veg bell pepper note that just doesn't gel with every day wear, an interesting scent but again not something you want to smell like generally. I have 100+ niche samples for swap within Europe - updated spreadsheet of samples on my profile, get in touch!"", 'I definately get the chili pepper/ bell pepper vibe. I made the mistake of spraying twice and im tasting this! Tickles the nose too! I get a hint of cinammon but i dont get any of the cocoa. As some have mentioned it does have a green vegetal vibe and not really a rich spicy as is typical for orientals. Interesting concept but i dont really want to smell like ive been chopping veg so i will pass! Thanks planet x for the generous sample though x', 'Oh I love this! Just trying my first sniff of this now on my arm. The opening is capsicum, so fresh and sweet! Vanilla, chocolate, chilli and poppy combining to make this scent uplifting, fresh and romantic. Beautiful! Will add more when it settles. I think you have to love capsicum to love this.', ""This is an odd fragrance. Spicy and vegetal at the beginning. Not too pleasant. Awful-smelling on paper. But it warms on my skin, and the drydown smells amazingly like Dzongkha's drydown. Not identical, mind you. But FAR more than one would have predicted, given the listed notes, and the lack of similarly between them."", ""Piment Br√ªlant Review Starts with a traffic light set of bell peppers - think green, then progressively getting sweeter through yellow then red. This lasts for the first 30 minutes as we start picking up slight amber and clove layered over a thicker poppy scent. I get no development into cacao or cinnamon, and the dry down of vanilla and chili pepper warmth kind of seems out of place, though far from unpleasant. This certainly is a different 'chili' take than Thierry Mugler created. Over all, certainly a unique fragrance with solid longevity and average silage. I would say this wasn't for the younger generation, as you need to have lots of confidence to wear this. I would also recommend this for cooler times in the year. Scent: 6/10 Projection: 7/10 Longevity: 7/10 Gender: unisex Season: Spring/Autumn"", ""It is spicey and it is sweet, but it's lightspeed-fading and it doesn‚Äôt show any depth to me, it seems quite uninteresting encounter despite the fact that the perfume has all the ingresients I like. It‚Äôs flat on me. It leaves no trace on my skin. A very disappointing frangrance."", ""This is a Red Hot Chilli Pepper. The 'Heat' sensation is coming from the chilli seeds, I know this because In Sri Lanka, we are all chili dogs. It just overshadows and clouds all other layers behind it.there are many sensual notes in the background but the chilli note doesn't allow me to peek into the rest.  For me it is a perfume to make someone in my homeland laugh and make fun at me for paying a price to buy a red chilli. But I do appreciate the sense and aesthete of the designer's thinking."", ""Opens with a lushious, sharp, green texture which is fresh and definitely smells of poppy, a floral smell I'm actually familiar with. It's not particularly pleasant or sweet but very naturally, sappy and slightly metallic I also detect a hint of resin in here perhaps galbanum seeing as it's a lasting fresh, greenness. Throughout Piment Brulant there's a strength from that pimento at the back, peppered heat in all its glory and a definite hint of that earthy, bitter-sweet Cocoa which works as perfectly in this perfume as it does in a chocolate & chili dessert. As it dries down this becomes stronger and more and more what the fragrance is all about, really feels like it might burn your nose if you sniff it for too long. I think the desired effect is similar to others from this perfumer, a real challenge to the senses, coupled with something I actually enjoy wearing, like Timbuktu. I think Bertrand Duchaufour great and although this isn't my favourite of his work I can't help but appreciate the craft. I think if you like green openings coupled with very spicy drydowns but at the same time quite weak, translucent, skin scents....then I'd recommend this one. Not a big projector and with average lasting power Piment Brulent was an enjoyable fragrance for me."", ""I love this perfume. It is green but not like a garden. It is fresh but not like calligna. It has a sweetness but not vanilla like everyone says . More like a touch of iris to balance. It is extremely wearable, unusual and long lasting. I love l artisan and it's one of the best though nothing compares to passage d'enfer . I wear it often, it's easy to wear to work as it is to a night out. You couldn't not Like it .... Unusual but clean and gorgeous."", 'I get some cinnamon in the opening but the amber is there from the beginning to the end. I love the drydown with amber and pepper. Never imagined pepper could smell so good in a scent. Very comforting but in an original way.', ""Very similar to Pacifica's Mexican Cocoa without the richness and depth--Piment Brulant is a thin, transparent, unsatisfying scent. An interesting concept, but if you are attracted to it, Pacifica does it better at a fraction of the cost."", 'Curiously enough, typical base notes (vanilla, musk, amber) present themselves in the opening of Piment Brulant, then fade away to reveal the scent of chili powder. It\'s a ""Benjamin Buttons"" fragrance, aging in reverse. That being said, I wish the opening lasted! The cinnamon-spice and warm sweetness coupled with peppery heat is uniquely ""foody"" while also feeling wearable. (I never perceived any chocolate or clove during the brisk open-to-drydown process of Piment Brulant.) The drydown smells like the taste of paprika powder and cayenne powder mixed; grainy and ground - one powder maintaining a red color and one powder adding heat. It has zero sweetness or depth.  I am going to try and layer something chocolately over this (or maybe a linear caramel scent) to see what happens. I can\'t wear Piment Brulant alone - I feel like I\'ve spilled Taco Bell fire sauce on my shirt...which is a normal occurrence in my life, but I don\'t want to smell like that on purpose.', ""One of the worst I've tried in the l artisan parfumeur range!! Yuk and disgusting!! It's like someone has splashed you with a chilli sauce bottle of encona!! It just smells of smoked paprika, I'm not getting any other notes!! Defiantly one to avoid!! Horrible!!!!!"", ""This was a blind buy and it worked out really well. Ultimately this is a green floral not very oriental spicy to my nose.  The notes are misleading and when I read it smelled like a bell pepper I was a little worried. To me it has a tart green juicy fruit note similar to Duchaufour's CDG Rhubarb. In this case it is tempered with a tangy tomato leaf to creates the 'pepper' note. The cocoa is strong in the opening to provide a sweetbitter dry backdrop but this fades more over time. I can't determine the floral notes as poppy isn't much of a floral note but there's something hot pink about this. The base is light, slightly dusty with clove and transparent amber. It doesn't come on strong but I could smell on my clothes the next day and definitely wanted more."", 'This one reminds me of the movie Chocolat. It smells like I imagine that hot Mexican chocolate with a pinch of hot pepper that was served to the grumpy lady. There is indeed a version of hot chocolate served in parts of Mexico made of bitter dark chocolate and chile (dry and ground chile, of various types). PB smells like that but also with some additional spices in it. Me like it.', ""Just because ‚Äúcocoa‚Äù and ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù are listed in the fragrance description doesn‚Äôt mean Piment Brulant is a sweet fragrance; there‚Äôs nothing sweet about it! In fact, I can‚Äôt smell any cocoa or chocolate OR vanilla. Not one ounce of sugary sweetness here, just a vegetable garden‚Ä¶ FRESH vegetables. Fresh, but not in a soapy or ‚Äúaqua‚Äù way. I know it has clove in it, but the clove note is so well-blended that it isn‚Äôt noticeable. Overall, a somewhat unique, although somewhat familiar, fragrance. Whatever their original intention, I give L‚ÄôArtisan a Thumbs Up for duplicating the smell of a farmers market, and converting it into a surprisingly wearable fragrance. UPDATE: After wearing it again, and again, and again, as someone else said, it really doesn't have any depth. Overall, not really wearable, in my opinion."", ""Poppy and pepper. I wished the other sweet/gourmand notes stuck out but they really don't. This leans towards being more feminine than anything. This is not a safe blind buy as I now know. Judging by the pyramid it could have been a masterpiece but it falls into the dislike category for myself."", ""This one is pretty strange. I tried it because of the note tree, hoping for something like a spicy bitter chocolate scent or even a sweet spicy type, but this is just pepper all the way through. My parents both call this bell pepper but I would describe this more as a hot pepper, freshly cut and then applied directly to the wrist. The smell is so true I was actually surprised it didn't burn! I'm used to my skin pulling out sweet notes in perfume but I get no chocolate, vanilla, or amber from this. I don't even smell cinnamon. It's completely one-note on me, and as such it's not one I'd wear again. I certainly can't say it's boring, but I hoped for the pepper to be a part of the whole instead of the entire scent."", ""Raspberry cacao and tomato stems. It doesn't sound like it'd work, but I'm really liking this fragrance, it feels much more wearable to me than some of my other L'Artisans. For some reason this perfume feels powdery to me, as though every time I put my nose to my wrist I'm sniffing cacao powder. I don't get the pepper reference, and I cook with peppers from time to time.  Very interesting combination of bright green notes and dusty undertones. I keep wanting to reapply."", 'This smelled exactly like what I was looking for on the tester strip, finally, I thought, an put it on my skin. And somehow it never got there. Seriously, you can detect a ""something"" but you can\'t smell it at all. Such a shame.  On the strip it\'s warm, spicy, peppery, something that I imagine must really develop on skin, into something comforting without being sickly sweet.', 'Piment brulant wasn\'t on my wishlist at all... after having tried Poivre piquant I felt pretty bored to go for another in the same series.  So I just got here by chance as a friend blindbought it and wanted to immediately get rid of it. He was disgusted. In my case, I was instantly charmed! Not as in : wow, beautiful! but more in a different sort of feeling... I felt demanded. On the one hand, the strong smell of hot chili pepper after you open one with a knife and take your nose very close to the vegetable... that exact feeling is what is offered here. Does it sound a bit too plain? too weird? well... it does indeed but I still can\'t believe how l\'Artisan managed to give it a very exotic, wearable and somehow sexy edge. Think of the chili in Dzongkha but without the metal part or the incense. They\'re twin scents to me... this is much simpler and less spectacular but still manages to outstand marvellosly. I can\'t sense the chocolate at all I\'m afraid... On the other hand let me add I\'ve been stopped by several people to ask what I\'m wearing. No one said chili pepper or anything close... they mentioned ""flowers"", ""wilderness"" and ""uniqueness"". When I told them the piment part they all went: ohhhh true!!! So I suggest you try this without thinking of smelling like food since most people have a different take on smells according to where they get them from. I\'m sure many women and men could stand out using this as a signature without a single person recognizing the obvious chili pepper... The same happens in Padparadscha where the chili is very strong. It simply gives you an alluring extra touch. Still... not the easiest scent to go around with... needs a try before buy. If you get stressed with weird scents, don\'t even spray. As for me: a great new addition! It lasts for ever and ever and works better in early spring and autumn... could be too much in summer and too faint in cold cold winter.', ""This starts off with a huge pop of raspberry-chocolate-something that I found gratingly tangy - enough that I wondered if this would be the first L'Artisan scent I scrubbed off my arm. Gave it some time, and it mellowed into a clovey peppery odor with the teeniest whiff of chocolate. Not a bad scent at all - kind of interesting and complex - but not how I personally want to smell."", ""Okay, I'm going to be honest here. The notes listed are SERIOUSLY misleading and if someone purchased this based on the notes listed in the description I am certain it would leave them with an industrial sized WTF. This does NOT smell like hardly anything listed. It smells like vegetation. Specifically, the cutting board where you have been cutting up a variety of multi colored peppers. Once it settles down it warms up a TAD and I detect a TINY, minuscule amount of chocolate and a itty bitty smidge of vanilla. But seriously....cinnamon?? Really?? Chocolate?? It smells like a vegetable garden. Like if you are watering a vegetable garden of mixed veggies and get a light whiff of veggies and vines. I was doing just that this morning and I swear the bed should have a L'Artisan sign on it because this is exactly what I was smelling. And it is just a VERY faint smell. I mean, this is like an eau fraiche. I love L'Artisan. I own 20 full bottles and have owned more in the past. But I just got this and Poivre Piquant and both leave me puzzled. I love pepper....its not that...I just don't get either one really. Neither do I get the plastic caps they are using now (I want my heavy gold cap!) I know scent is different for everyone and I wish I was getting what other people are getting because I HATE saying anything negative about L'Artisan. I feel blasphemous because they are a near holy figure to me."", ""while checking the notes listed in Piment Br√ªlant, the savoury dark chocolate spiced up by chili pepper immediately pops into my head. Unfortunately, on me the chocolate never manages to peep out. Upon application, it smells spicy, green and crisp, like many have pointed out, the freshly cut green bell pepper. I can hardly get other notes suggested. After about 4 hours, it evolves towards red chili pepper but overall it remains the same cold spicy tone which is a similar ambiance that I got from Un Jardin apr√®s la Mousson.  The sillage is close to skin. The longevity is at least 6 hours. A very interesting olfactory exprience though not exactly what I expected. It's actually a versatile fragrance, fresh enough for summer, spicy enough for winter. However, it lacks something sensual to evoke a 'love' for the scent itself. I'd love to get a small bottle for my collection, but a 100ml bottle just seems an eternity to me."", ""This fragrance really smells hot pepper! Even too natural:) I wouldn't like to smell this way. But if you're hot pepper lover - it's for you."", ""This must surely be one of the most underrated perfumes of all due to it's uniqueness. I can't think of anything else like it; an incredibly uplifting, mouth-watering, unisex, zesty mix of fresh bell peppers and soft musk. It lasts nearly all day (quite incredible for a citrus perfume). I can't smell anything like chocolate in it, as other people have claimed. Give it a try if you're looking for something light and bright with a different character to the usual floral/vanilla/fruity formula. I think it's spectacularly good."", ""Ugh, I definetely don't like this. All I can smell is the pepper..."", ""Paprika passion. Piment Brulant is an interesting discovery for me. Not because I've never heard about the actual paprika-chocolate combo,but because for me this was the very first encounter with paprika note used in perfume.This is the reason why I gave a try to this scent,because I thought: if the pairing of chocolat-chilli culinary works together-forming a piquant taste,then perhaps should work well for the olfactory world as well?.:) Piment Brulant is a special fragrance.To me evokes sweet memories about Hungary, where I was born. Paprika and chilli is one of the famous product of my country, the hungarians very proud of the hungarian paprika. The initial blast of this perfume on me the exact smell of the freshly cutted green chilli paprika with its characteric features. Green, slightly bitter and vegetal smell with almost nose-tingling effect.Under this crisp and fresh flavor I can smell pale flowers in the background with hardly sweet cocoa and slightly noticable raspberry note. Warm and spicy, piquant and really unique combination is this.The hot chilli is stays focus in the middle phase as well,rounded its edginess with sweet cocoa and vanilla.As the time goes by the scent getting deeper and warmer,amber and the poppy flower make the composition richer and thicker.The debut intensity turns into a sophisticated piquancy.The scent itself well-balanced,warm but fresh,spicy and savoury.If this fragrance was really inspired by the aztech's famous chocolate drink,I have to say Mr.Douchaufour perfectly image that. Piment Brulant is special and undoubtedly unique fragrance.Strangely pleasant and pleasantly strange.Maybe a little astounding at the first moments but worth wait the outcome. Perhaps Piment Brulant a little too gourmand for my taste, but I admit,I had a very pleasant experience with this scent. The strong presense of the chilli pepper is amazingly lift up the character of this fragrance, gives a sparkling and quirky edge to the perfume. I recommend to sampling this scent before buying but if You have a chance,really worth to give a try to this interesting perfume. If you are looking for a new olfactory adveture, here you are: Piment Brulant is a perfect fragrance for the begin of exploring.;)"", ""This is actually one of the most surprising, interesting fragrances I ever had the chance to try. It really smells like when you slice open a chilli in the kitchen and the strong heat gets to your throat almost making you sneeze. And there is a sweetness with it which gives it balance. It is warm, warm... getting warmer. I actually feared it would start burning on the skin where I applied it. But it didn't. It also let through some undefined floral smell. I liked the experience, I don't know when I'm going to put it on, but I have it in my collection now and it is one of the most original fragrances I ever smelled."", ""Wow, I decided not to read up on any reviews before trying this out, and I was shocked at the difference in what I smelled vs. what are the actual ingredients in this lovely concoction. From the top notes, I swore this was a zesty, clean, green, pepper-and-tomato scent with a hint of floral just beneath...I thought it would make a great day scent in the spring months, make the wearer feel energized and confident. Then later, it darkened...and thickened. Like a savory syrup, it became a spicy chili/chocolate confection - the zest is kept alive, but it takes a sexier turn...I can see why one of the earlier reviewers mentioned wearing this to parties! It still makes me think of warmer months, but it could definitely be worn more as a date night or evening-out perfume. I can't stop sniffing it. I'm not wholly convinced I need a full bottle, but a smaller decant seems like a great place to start. The tiny sample vial I have won't be nearly enough for me to continue this adventure!"", ""I like P.B., in spite of all the time, I took to make a proper decision about it . The green opening is what the majority and me get since the very beginning, but on my skin, also the double 'hot' effect of pimento is evident: spicy as it is on one side and warmy on the other: so a double sensation at the same time. The presence of chocolate - that on my skin is clearly detectable - helps to give a sense of unity to this fragrance, but I cannot distinguish any vanilla notes in change. I love most of B. D. creations, but I think that Piment Brulant is more an intention to investigate new paths in perfumery, than creating a 'beautiful' fragrance, easy to be appreciated (that's NOT a fault!) by everyone, therefore I would say this is an original frag, no matter if you like it or not, but probably 'difficult' to love (see above the majority of people voting). Whispering sillage but good persistence for being both an e.d.t. and a creation by l'Artisan P. as well. I believe that it could be really versatile concerning 'when to use it', according to my own experience, it is great with rainy, cold depressing weather......  It's a frag that seems - to me - so 'natural'."", 'Where is chocolate?? All I can smell is spice and green/flower. Instead of what i have imagined, PB as a fiery/dirty sweet/passionate lover; this is just a no fuss/clean/elegant longtime girlfriend. A nice smell, but does not last long, good for office maybe. Not worth the price.', ""It smells heavenly in the bottle - spicy chocolate. On my skin it smells like I've rubbed freshly cut green pepper juice all over me, and I don't enjoy the scent."", 'Scent as at my mother-in-law in the greenhouse. The spicy paprika, the chocolate unfortunately does not appear at me.', 'Piment Brulant is a transparent, very natural and clean scent. It‚Äôs not ‚Äòthick‚Äô‚Äîwhich is an advantage for me because I do not like thick or viscous perfumes. Piment B. opens with realistic ""vegetable garden"" notes of fresh, juicy, and very aromatic peppers. I can also smell moist, cool, and crumpled/macerated poppy petals and an intense smell of carnations, with their characteristic bitterness. I have to admit that I don\'t ""detect"" any smell of chocolate, rather powdery, bitter, raw cocoa, which pleasantly tickles the nose. Although Piment Brulant remains on my skin for several hours, it does not smell distinctly ambery or musky. It has more of a fine, ""suede"" sweetness in the base notes. For me, it is a beautiful, luminous, evocative, and joyful fragrance, which, despite its transparency, has, on my skin, an amazing staying power.', ""I like scents that aren't the norm and stand out, although I can't say I'd wear it everyday. This one is one of those that need a confident person to wear who doesn't take #$*% from any one. I think I'd wear this one more around holidays such as thanksgiving or christmas. It's very very warm and spicy, although part of it's peppery side gives it a crispness like bell pepper, yet at the same time it's like cayenne. Amber and vanilla seem to give it's peppery-ness a softer more feminine side although I can't seem to get much of a hint for chocolate."", ""Yes, you will smell like hot peppers. Do I love it? Yes. I also don't get much chocolate in the scent, just the fresh, spicy smell of peppers. I'm a big fan of L'Artisan Parfumeur and this by-far is my favorite, but I like weird smells. Meh."", 'My mum uses this perfume when she goes to parties and she smells really good. Party perfume for sure...', ""Now that Iron chefs have opened the floodgates to culinary creativity, I'm willing to try just about anything. I was skeptical, but I tried Lindt dark chocolate studded with red chili peppers and discovered that it actually tastes quite good. Do the same notes mingle harmoniously in perfume? Bernard Duchaufour apparently set out to find out with L'Artisan Parfumeur PIMENT BRULANT. Although I applaud the designer's daring, his willingness to risk ridicule for having produced a perfume which smells EXACTLY like salsa, I'm afraid my admiration does not extend so far as to be willing to wear such a scent. A strong green bell pepper note combines in this composition with red chili peppers and a slightly acidic quality to produce a fragrance empirically indistinguishable from, believe it or not: salsa.  This is *not* mole: I do not even pick up on the chocolate note. Nor do the cinnamon or vanilla break through the wall of chili as isolable notes. What we have here, in effect, is a rich, delicious, high-quality chili powder comprising many different spices ground together--including perhaps even poppy seeds--in liquid form. Interesting, yes. Perhaps wearable, in theory, as a novelty fragrance. FB-worthy? Don't think so. D√©sol√©e."", ""This recipe sounds intriguing and tempting.  I love it in chocolate and hot coco. I had to try it in a perfume as well. And I started with a whole bottle. It was exciting for few days but it took a while to use all of it.  It is from the same family with Safran Troublant and Poivre Piquant. For my nose this is green pimento. It doesn‚Äôt have the aroma and richness of the well-ripped red fruit. I doubt they would use the fruits anyway. The oil would be very spicy on the skin. Most probably this is an extract from the plant (leaves and stems).  It starts very green and reminds me of the plant‚Äôs leaves. The amber brings balance and depth. After 30 min there is a dark and light smoky tone coming in: dark chocolate. Not the gourmand sweet chocolate, just the raw dark coco. Really nice note.  Vanilla starts strong and candy sweet. Poor choice. It doesn‚Äôt balance the green pimento stems at all.  No surprise thou, I can't imagine any thick green tones working well with candy sweet vanilla. Maybe sandalwood?  However after 30 min these note becomes subtler. I would say this is the best part. Together with the dry down. At least 6 hours long lasting.  I don‚Äôt feel any cinnamon. Luckyscent shows cloves and I can feel that, very subtle enhancing the dark chocolate.  The musk comes in after one hour or so.  Overall, it is a unique and interesting fragrance, probably not a must have but definitely a must try. 7.8/10"", 'What a disappointment!!!! ...I get no chocolate whatsoever.!!!! The Vanilla and Cocoa mentioned in what would be an ""Aztec Love Potion"" sounds great,don\'t they"" Well those notes are undetectable to me. ...I get Fresh Green Bell Peppers with what might be more green notes of Tomato. It did settle into a  Red Bell Pepper / Spicy Red Chile combo... that since I have been inhaling in  at my wrist .... so desperately... I now can taste...! I just don\'t do Fresh Green scents .. they turn on me and my nose finds it appalling. It\'s Clean and Green...most assuredly different, but It\'s not for me.', ""I've read reviews and have been led to believe that all L'Artisan Parfumeur fragrances are weak - too weak to justify the price. Well, maybe that's to be ignored. Today, I sampled Piment Brulant. I get the chili, but it's not alone. No one around is going to sneeze or wonder if you just finished cooking a spicy dish. On my skin, I DO get a hint of chocolate, which I don't believe was put there to be noticed. IMO, its job is to make sure that the chili doesn't overpower everything else in the fragrance. I can tell that this one wears close, as far as the nose is concerned. But this follows you around and others would notice this on you long after you've dismissed it as having worn off too soon. This would have significant lasting power on fabric and it's unique enough to justify a 100ml-bottle purchase. Personally, I love it! This may very well become my 2nd niche fragrance. UPDATE: it's 1:05 AM (4/29/2010) Uhm, this is still on my arm.. It's wearing very close at this point, but I can still smell it. When I went out earlier, it kept following me and I could smell it all around me.. Poor lasting power? I think NOT... It's on my want list..... UPDATE 2: (05/09/2010) After testing this more and more, I've had a few swings on the pendulum about this one. Sometimes, it can last forever and sometimes it fades too soon for my taste. But I've finally figured out the magic formula for me... Spray this one on the garment(s) and use The Body Shop's Vanilla on my skin. Voila!!! All possible doubts have been permanently laid to rest."", ""mmmmmmmm red chili peppers dipped in dark chocolate with red poppies makes me think of a Lasse Hallstrom film  Chocolat when Juliette Binoche's character Vianne Rocher sturring up a repressed town with her scandalious Chocholate reciepes she breaks convention like this perfume or during the restoration period during the reign  of King Charles II when is was the end of the Protectorate rule with all of it's austerity and repression.  the restorian brought freedom and prosperity with thearters with lavish sets the courts of france and england  made of copious amount of silks from china spices from india Pompous men with long wig fashioned in curls  women in lavish costume full of regal  splender entertainment is a anything goes orgy full of actrobats dancers  Comic hariquinns and a endless line of food from faraway lands imported from the new world indians with mohawk hair presenting an unsual new delicesey  chocolate with red hot pepper inside with creamy vanilla.  this is a not a conventional fragrance if you what to think outside the box  of high fashion perfumes and the average fragrance notes of florals fruits and musk in the bottle this is the perfume for you."", ""Ian Anderson could easily compose a followup to his Habanero Reel with this one. Perhaps it'd be called the Piment Brulant Jig. A bright fragrance, a dancing fragrance. One I'd regulated to summer use only, but today is in the 30's and a spritz of this dazzler is just what's needed to combat the cold; not even a bit out of place with my suede and jamawar. The pepper that is front and center here is not quite a bell - but it is spot on for the nearly inedible Aja Dulce - a pepper that looks just like a scotch bonnet, but is instead quite sweet, with zero heat. What the Aja Dulce does have in habanero-like proportions, is an overwhelmingly perfume-y flowery flavor that makes it useless for anything other than a novelty candy or perhaps an oddball canape. Piment Brulant is it's own novelty candy, and embodies this unique, standout individuality of the Aja Dulce perfectly. It also is one of those few fragrances that very noticeably morphs on my skin, becoming amplified, richer and deeper the longer I have it on, and noticeably different from it's aroma on inanimate cloth or paper. Short phrase - it works with my chemistry, everyone should test first. The chocolate does not come out for me. Instead, it is this amazing rare variety of capsicum, a hint of raspberry, a touch of 12-year old Scotch with all it's complexity and depth, and perhaps some unisex 'clean' notes... a few indescribable bits, and all around terrific. I definitely hope it's around for a long time, but these unique quirky jewels are not made for mass appeal. Another one to horde."", ""Notes are verry intriguing!  In fact... it's called after peppers it smells like a pepper. A green pepper and some red chili ones. Very interesting in my opinion and hell a lot original. It's very rich and may not be loved by many people, but it's worth to try! I can't feel chocolate or vanilla or cinnamon. Pure pepper. My grandma grows peppers (the hot ones) in pots and they're looking fab when you look at her windows and see them standing there. Peppers are very small and if you pick one and tear open then it will smell like Piment Brulant. __________________________ I smelled it from paper, but I'll try it later on skin.."", 'Edited to Add: Scents generally have more ingredients than those listed. The L\'A P website lists notes as: hot pepper (i.e., chili), clove, cocoa, tonka, vanilla. ----- The nose behind ""Piment Brulant"" was apparently inspired by the Aztec drink ""cacahuatl"" (from the Mayan, ""xocoatl""), along with a recipe published in Spain in 1631 which blends the New World ingredients cocoa beans, chilies, vanilla and annatto (aka achiote) with Old World ingredients anise seed, cinnamon, almonds, hazelnuts, and white sugar. Besides, it is now fashionable to make chocolate bars and chocolate ice creams with chilis, vanilla, and spices, which i enjoy. Also, i often cook Medieval, Moroccan, Levantine, Persian, Indian, Thai, and Indonesian cuisines. So the collection of fragrance notes in ""Piment Brulant"" intrigued me. Still, i was surprised by this perfume. It was so rich and complex and sophisticated - more so than any of the other L\'Artisan Parfumeur fragrances i\'ve tried so far (and i\'ve loved nearly all of them). The combination of aromas is astonishing, perhaps counter-intuitive, but it works beautifully! At first spray i smell citrus (apparently not in it - perhaps it was the raspberry listed on some fragrance blogs), vanilla, red bell pepper, and capsicum (chili). As the scent develops more fragrances emerge, although none stand out individually. A non-specific, non-girly floral. Intriguing spices (fragrantica lists cinnamon, some fragrance blogs list clove). A hint of chocolate, strengthening slightly during dry-down. And a slight warm animal undertone. But it is absolutely NOT ""gourmand"", thank goodness. I want to bury myself in this! Yet it isn\'t overpowering - somehow it remains light and gentle (and has the infamous L\'Artisan Parfumeur short staying time). The only drawback is that i can ""taste"" it for a short while, although i only sprayed it on my arms. Certain scents have this effect on me, one reason i avoid lemon verbena - the flavor stays in my mouth for hours, even though i haven\'t ingested it. With ""Piment Brulant"" it isn\'t so unpleasant and only slightly distracting, and it diminishes over time. Given how wonderful this unlikely amalgam of fragrance notes is, that won\'t stop me from wearing this. As it dries down on me, the complexity remains, and fortunately neither the vanilla nor the musk becomes domineering. Assigning this to a time or a season based on conventional associations would point to nighttime or cold weather. But i love spicy food, which is typical of hot, even tropical, cultures, so i\'ll wear it anytime!', 'I really like this I\'m a cook, and my restaurant sells spicy food...I brought my smple in, and I said ""Hey guys, I\'ve got a perfume that smells like Salsa Verde!"" ""Get out of here, Bob, what are you drunk again?"" (Salsa Verde is a sauce that has a lot of green chile peppers and tomatillos in it...delicious!"" I gave everybody a drop on the wrist...and, ""God damn! Your\'e right! Salsa Verde and tomato stems!"" ""See guys, there\'s more to this hobby than just vanity!"" I got a little more respect for my ""girly"" hobby that day. Anyway, this would be the dream perfume for my fantasy date with a beautiful Mexican girl...on both of us! Truly creative and daring...hats off to L\'Artisan and Duchafour (who is a genius for the Aedes de Venustes). This is definitely a perfume that you can wear to dinner!', 'Darn. I get no chocolate whatsoever. I get red bell pepper with the tang of the green leaves from the pepper plant and maybe, just maybe, if I plant my nose on my wrist and inhale until I\'m dizzy, a touch of wood. It\'s clean and fresh and definitely different, but I\'m not sure it\'s really ""me.""', ""I wore this twice over the weekend...the first time, I was really turned off by the strong peppery notes in the beginning. I didn't pay much attention to it for awhile. But then I realized that the peppers had gotten sweeter and warmer. I never thought I would like the combination of vanilla, dark chocolate, and pimento...BUT I DO!  This is a very unique and musky gourmand that may not appeal to everyone, so make sure to sample it first. It lasted all day and got more and more delicious as the day progressed."", 'I¬¥ve tried it a coupple of days ago, and I didn¬¥t get impressed at all. One note dominate totally; green pepper (or paprika). The other notes stand quitely in the background almost unnoticed. Definitly try before you buy.

Haven\'t worked the soil for several years but still avidly peruse the seed catalogs every winter and stroll through the garden centers each spring. In my mind I\'m growing several varieties of tomatoes and peppers which end up in glorious salads and delicious grilled summer meals. Piment Brulant is going outside to the garden early in the morning with a cup of coffee in hand and bending to pick the weeds that have popped up overnight. It\'s crushing the leaves of pepper and tomato between my fingers and inhaling the aromas of spring, summer, salad and the gods and goddesses of plenty. Don\'t expect ""perfume"" or you\'ll be disappointed, as many reviewers state they have been. Expect the fragrance of a sunny roadside market stall filled with the ripe goodness of a vegetable garden well-nurtured and Mother Nature\'s promise of colorful, tasty and nutritious salads enjoyed outdoors with loving friends and family. To my nose and to coworkers sniffing Piment Brulant on me, there\'s absolutely no chocolate, no cinnamon, no clove...nothing shown in the pyramid above but peppers. Chile peppers, green bell peppers, ripe red bell peppers, and a background scent of tomato. More like a Demeter experience than a L\'Artisan creation, but a lovely surprise nonetheless. I love Piment Brulant and someday I will once again plant tomatoes and peppers.', 'Just notified that this was one of the fragrances L‚ÄôArtisan is discontinuing, so I hurriedly bought another bottle. I have had this perfume for quite a few years, wear it a while, get tired of it, then start up again when the weather first turns chilly. I don‚Äôt get what so many regard as a bell pepper scent, since I abhor bell peppers. No, it‚Äôs a nice spicy chilie pepper or pink peppercorn with a dash of cocoa, dry but not powdery. Not exactly Gardeny, but not typically perfumey either. All I know is that I like it enough to grab a backup, which is something I almost never do. I wear almost exclusively gourmands, usually on the sweet or fruity side. Although PB is in no way sweet, it still flirts with being a gourmand, and is one exception I‚Äôm happy to have in my collection', 'Piment brulant wasn\'t on my wishlist at all... after having tried Poivre piquant I felt pretty bored to go for another in the same series.

Does it sound a bit too plain? too weird? well... it does indeed but I still can\'t believe how l\'Artisan managed to give it a very exotic, wearable and somehow sexy edge. Think of the chili in Dzongkha but without the metal part or the incense. They\'re twin scents to me... this is much simpler and less spectacular but still manages to outstand marvellosly. I can\'t sense the chocolate at all I\'m afraid... On the other hand let me add I\'ve been stopped by several people to ask what I\'m wearing. No one said chili pepper or anything close... they mentioned ""flowers"", ""wilderness"" and ""uniqueness"". When I told them the piment part they all went: ohhhh true!!! So I suggest you try this without thinking of smelling like food since most people have a different take on smells according to where they get them from. I\'m sure many women and men could stand out using this as a signature without a single person recognizing the obvious chili pepper... The same happens in Padparadscha where the chili is very strong. It simply gives you an alluring extra touch. Still... not the easiest scent to go around with... needs a try before buy. If you get stressed with weird scents, don\'t even spray. As for me: a great new addition! It lasts for ever and ever and works better in early spring and autumn... could be too much in summer and too faint in cold cold winter.', ""Red Chlli Pepper - check. Vanilla - check (a little) Fresh - check Unique - check Anything else - meh Awesome scent - I ummed and ahhed about blind buying this one for so long. Finally took the plunge - not disappointed - exactly what I expected and classic L'Artisan. I find all the negative reviews here hard to fathom. Don't let people tell you it smells just like a garden or vegetables - whilst this may be the case it blends together to sit as a wearable perfume in its own right. I found when I suggested what it was or what the notes were people were then like - oh yeah - otherwise they thought it was just an awesome perfume! I think most notes here are complimentary but to me it really does smell like Red Chillli and vanilla. Don't get the Cacao. Amazing how well this captures a fresh cut Chilli Pepper at first. Awesome buy - for male (casual) or female (professional or casual - infact I think it is very sexy on a woman). Was a conversation starter at work (as was Comptoir Sud Pacifique Souffle Des Indes) - not that it will necessarily get you noticed but once my colleagues sampled it they were amazed such creations existed. Another one for the niche shelf for when I need a change of pace."", ""This is a Red Hot Chilli Pepper. The 'Heat' sensation is coming from the chilli seeds, I know this because In Sri Lanka, we are all chili dogs. It just overshadows and clouds all other layers behind it.there are many sensual notes in the background but the chilli note doesn't allow me to peek into the rest.  For me it is a perfume to make someone in my homeland laugh and make fun at me for paying a price to buy a red chilli. But I do appreciate the sense and aesthete of the designer's thinking."", 'This one reminds me of the movie Chocolat. It smells like I imagine that hot Mexican chocolate with a pinch of hot pepper that was served to the grumpy lady. There is indeed a version of hot chocolate served in parts of Mexico made of bitter dark chocolate and chile (dry and ground chile, of various types). PB smells like that but also with some additional spices in it. Me like it.', 'I definately get the chili pepper/ bell pepper vibe. I made the mistake of spraying twice and im tasting this! Tickles the nose too! I get a hint of cinammon but i dont get any of the cocoa. As some have mentioned it does have a green vegetal vibe and not really a rich spicy as is typical for orientals. Interesting concept but i dont really want to smell like ive been chopping veg so i will pass! Thanks planet x for the generous sample though x', 'What a disappointment!!!! ...I get no chocolate whatsoever.!!!! The Vanilla and Cocoa mentioned in what would be an ""Aztec Love Potion"" sounds great,don\'t they"" Well those notes are undetectable to me. ...I get Fresh Green Bell Peppers with what might be more green notes of Tomato. It did settle into a  Red Bell Pepper / Spicy Red Chile combo... that since I have been inhaling in  at my wrist .... so desperately... I now can taste...! I just don\'t do Fresh Green scents .. they turn on me and my nose finds it appalling. It\'s Clean and Green...most assuredly different, but It\'s not for me.', ""It smells heavenly in the bottle - spicy chocolate. On my skin it smells like I've rubbed freshly cut green pepper juice all over me, and I don't enjoy the scent."", ""Poppy and pepper. I wished the other sweet/gourmand notes stuck out but they really don't. This leans towards being more feminine than anything. This is not a safe blind buy as I now know.

There was a hot minute when ‚Äúcannabis‚Äù notes in perfume were trendy; unfortunately cannabis smoke smells bad. Apparently a popular solution is to just use patchouli instead, which is a choice I can get behind. An hour in, Coze warms slightly; I don‚Äôt get chocolate or coffee, but I do get a hazy ambered hay or dried-grass scent, golden and sheer and still peppery around the edges. Coze retains its dark-green peppery patchouli character all the way through ‚Äî it just gets more and more transparent and hazy. It‚Äôs slightly warmed by vanilla, but it never gets outright sweet. This is a patchouli that hasn‚Äôt forgotten it‚Äôs a leaf. Pierre Guillaume makes a lot of perfumes and allegedly most of them are duds; but Coze is a winner.

Is that the hemp? the only cannabis I am able to discern is the skanky dirty smell that I perceive on some people who smoke weed, and that is NOT what this perfume smells like. If I smell it close to the skin I get a little more agrestic scent, like a hay/dry herbaceous smell.  I like this. I don't know how to explain this scent but it's very interesting."", 'Coze is a fragrance with a very strong personality. Unlike most perfumes, it has a ""truncated"" pyramid, meaning it is devoid of citrusy or volatile notes that often characterize the opening. The result is a composition that immediately starts in a decisive way, with bitter notes of hemp accompanied by a hard tobacco and enhanced by a bitter, realistic chocolate. It seems it wanted to reproduce a memory: that of his father\'s newly opened cigar box, with all its aromas. Well, we have fully succeeded.

I find it very wearable too, it really is just a chocolatey, herby patchouli for those who are not familiar with the smell of hemp, and for those who are, it smells enough of it to trigger the brain's pleasure center but it's not gonna be off-putting to anyone. I love that's perfectly balanced between sweet and fresh, dry and damp. I can pick up the coffee note too, super relaxing."", 'I kinda like it: rich chocolaty patchouli with some herbal (even minty) freshness and a tiny bit of sweetness underneath.

Definitely a must try.', 'Got it a few days ago from ZGO and love it! Someone said it is a musky gourmand and it does capture Coze a bit. It is not a sweet scent, only slightly. It is unique, darkish, a bit smokey but very wearable.', ""Sumptuous patchouli fragrance. Specifically, a lot more going on here: there's a touch of pimento pepper (similar to Piment Brulant, but more subdued), some clever nuances of cocoa-chocolate, and a two-faceted accord of 'green' tobacco (no sweetness) and marijuana. In fact, it smells quite close to someone smoking a beedi (a form of cigarette common in the Indian subcontinent) - especially if the smoker was also wearing patchouli oil. However, here's the great thing about Coze: despite its diverse elements, it is coherent, suave and and has a rugged sophistication. It is also very well-crafted, easy to wear; expansive and makes one feel good. While it is a patchouli fragrance, it is not a one-note bore but is multifaceted, and in the same 'patchouli plus' group that would include Coromandel, A*Men or Nicolai's Patchouli. I also find it to have some 'green'/herbal elements, similar to Devin or Wazamba. There is hardly any sweetness in this, and the overall vibe is dry, dusty. Finally, it is an EdT and wears exactly as it should. It is a little loud initially but quickly tones down in thirty minutes when its best dynamics come into play, and it is very soft after six or seven hours.

It opens with a spicy dark chocolate, supported by a vegetal/green note (supposedly an impression of hemp/marijuana, but it misses the shot on that aspect, but who cares). Shortly after, the chocolate morphs into a beautiful dry tobacco note, and appears. Then, at the one-hour mark, the tobacco fades out to leave the stage to an oily vanillic/chocolat-ey patchouli, leaning towards gourmand (and I wish it was a bit less sweet at that stage). The only downside is the below average performance, that should be better at that price point. Still, it's a beautiful fragrance. Had to go for a full bottle.

This fragrance was designed as an ode to Pierre Guillame\'s grandfather\'s cigar box and I feel like it focuses more on the actual box as opposed to the tobacco contained within. It\'s an intensely dry woody fragrance with lots of nutmeg and cloves at first, and the patchouli in it lends it\'s peppery woody character, not it\'s green leafy character. The whole thing is wrapped up in an almost burnt feeling, every note in this is verging on being scorched a tiny bit, which again, adds to the dryness.

The smell of cozy pubs and bars in northern cities, with extra whiffs of old vinyl record shops in the 1970s. I find it delicious, but verging juuuuust on overbearing territory - it surely wouldn't go with everything, and seems so strong and rich it could be overwhelming on warm or hot days. To me this is a great big, bulky, imbued-with-bar-smells woollen overcoat you'd wear to protect from winter drizzle. At the beginning there's even a noticeable waft of ashtray - not poisonous nicotiney ash, but definitely a sense of something that's smouldered and been stubbed out. Hugely characterful - and I don't mean that as a polite way of saying 'borderline weird', but in the sense of being distinctively itself and not like much else I've ever tried. I'm powerfully ambivalent about it: for about 80% of the time I love and admire it, then for the other 20% I'm wondering if it's just too much. And this is, I'm pretty sure, the modern formulation tried on a woman - what must the old stuff on male skin have been like? A knockout, no doubt.  Definitely unisex-skewing-masculine, but wearable on women - it's really *not* shy, though, it projects like a mother and is not a discreet kind of smell anyway, so definitely do try before you buy.

Very well done. I am pleased.', ""Not a Parfumerie Generale fan but I can admit that Coze is one of the more coherent products of the house and possesses true ambition which is a thing I do not normally associate with their slapdash work (to put it bluntly). This fragrance instantly conjures up imagery of the legendary Honno-ji incident, a coup d'√©tat against the Japanese daimyo Oda Nobunaga and the raging flames that enveloped his body as he committed seppuku in the temple to prevent the enemy from claiming his head. Groovy!"", 'Parfumerie General 02 (PG02) Coze is an oriental woody first introduced in 2002. It has notes of Indian hemp (canapa sativa), patchouli, coffee, pimento, pepper, sandalwood, ebony wood, Virginian cedar, tobacco, and Bourbon vanilla. It was created by Pierre Guillaume, who is best known for this house (where he is the perfumer for all of the scents), as well as a couple of Phaedon‚Äôs better-known perfumes, especially Oliban and Rouge Avignon. Right off the top of Coze, I get a blend of sharply peppered woods and spices, reminiscent of a very nice aftershave or a big, powerful 80s fougere for men. I pick up on a wood that I‚Äôve never smelled in isolation ‚Äì perhaps the Indian hemp, which is supposed to be rich, warm, and seductive. There‚Äôs that lovely pepper note that lingers throughout the top and the heart of the fragrance that keeps it interesting and differentiates it from a boring masculine fougere. Still further into the life of the fragrance, a powdery, dark, bitter cocoa begins to gently assert itself.  The entire presentation of the smell and the way that it wears on the skin is exceedingly dry and masculine. It doesn‚Äôt flirt with sweetness at all, even despite the apparent presence of bourbon vanilla pods, which really have an oaky effect anyway, not the treacle we associate with the smell of synthetic vanilla often used unsparingly in women‚Äôs perfumes. Despite being familiar with the list of ingredients, none of them pop readily out into the forefront. It‚Äôs one of those fragrances that‚Äôs so wonderfully blended that on my skin, I‚Äôm hard pressed to tell that there is any single note: patchouli, coffee, woods, tobacco, or vanilla.  After doing a bit of snooping, apparently this used to be quite more a bit more powerful than it currently it, and used to be a real powerhouse on the skin. Whether this is true or not, I can‚Äôt say; I‚Äôve only just landed my nose on it a couple of days ago. But the decant that I got (which is from DecantShop, and I have every reason to believe is authentic) doesn‚Äôt last more than two hours before becoming a skin scent that resembles a soft suede with hints of the Bourbon vanilla and the sweetness of dried fruit. All in all, quite a lovely fragrance. If it lasted three times as long, it would get a hearty recommendation from me. Nota bene: One of the things that I really like about Parfumerie General fragrances is that they don‚Äôt just come in 50 and 100 ml, but also 30 ml ‚Äì in case you‚Äôre one of those afflicted souls who needs another 3.4 oz of perfume like they need a hole in the head.

It smells leathery and acrid. There is a distinct menthol quality jumping out at me that is reminding me of turpentine; I\'d put it down to the piquancy of the chilli clashing with the acute bitterness of the black chocolate and coffee. After about 15 minutes, the unpleasant medicinal screech subsides and things get much drier and smokier. A thick cloud of hashish invades my nostrils, through which I can smell musty wood, leather furniture and dank, oily patchouli. Reminds me of a past visit to Christiania, the infamous commune of weed-smoking hippies nestled in the center of Copenhagen. Like the hippies, ""Coze"" is earthy, disheveled and just plain weird to be honest. I can\'t envisage wearing this beyond my hall door.

I just dabbed this on before checking the notes and I'm going to have to scrub.

Complex, but not overbearing that your nose is trying to pick apart every single note. Calming to your mind. The name is perfect and suits it.', 'Trying Parfumerie Generale (PG02) Coze for the first time. On my skin, up top I definitely got the hemp with a dash of pepper, but not overwhelming to my nose (but my sample was not a spray so I had to dab, which tends to make a difference to my skin on how a fragrance presents). About midway I could pick up the patchouli and was thrilled (one of my fave scents), intermixed with coffee and chocolate. Never detected the tobacco until drydown, and then almost an ashtray tobacco scent (but not in an unpleasant way). Honestly don‚Äôt know what Ebony wood is supposed to smell like, but I detect something woody at the base so presume that‚Äôs it. At the finish, patchouli, vanilla and sweet tobacco were the strongest on my skin.  On me this was not heavy but again I had to dab instead of spray which makes a difference for me. This had fairly soft sillage for me but I used only a small amount, and if I were actually using this from a bottle I‚Äôd definitely use more and probably get better projection from it. On my skin everything seemed to settle in after about an hour, and this lasted on me for about 4 ‚Äì 5 hours before becoming a faint skin scent.  I definitely see this as a cool weather scent and would not wear in spring or summer heat, but I find it unoffensive enough that I‚Äôd wear it to the office. I also can see this being a nice fragrance for either day or evening wear. Unlike other reviewers, I never picked up that clove note even though I was intentionally looking for it (and I actually like clove). On me, the patchouli and vanilla with notes of tobacco and wood dominate, and if there are any cloves in there they are buried deep! Right now I‚Äôm riding between Like and Love, and will try it a few more times to see if I get nudged in one direction or the other. I know this is a unisex scent, but to my nose this comes across as quite a sweet scent and on my skin definitely falls on the feminine side. I‚Äôm not sure some men would feel comfortable wearing this, while others would. Although, having said that, this PG02 Coze is intoxicating enough that the juxtaposition between this sweet fragrance on a macho guy wearing this rising up from his chest could be an alluring combination! As always, your results may vary!', ""One of the best gourmands I have ever encountered. It's like a croquembouche soaked in coffee liqueur, dipped in chocolate ganache, then topped with billows of Chantilly whipped cream and melted caramel.

I was in the middle of backpacking around the world with one of my best girlfriends when we landed in Amsterdam. We had just come from the beaches in South India where a palm reader had foretold me that I would soon be married to a Dutchman. This became a huge joke between my friend and I so, of course, when I arrived in Amsterdam, I was already in an adventurous fun-loving mood. Well, if the whole of Europe had to name one city as THE party city, Amsterdam would be it. I had been living in Berkeley, so I thought I had seen it all. But, this city took it to a whole new level for me. I had, what I call, the Amsterdam Deluxe experience. We were lucky enough to stay with two of the most beautiful people on earth who had an open marriage. A funny thing happens when you‚Äôre with two beautiful locals active on the dating scene, and that is that the entire city opens its arms to you. Within days, I found myself at a huge out of control boat party on the canals with a full band, cocktails, space cakes, chocolate and beer from Brussels, you name it. The boat took the entire party touring through the red light district. I met my ‚ÄúDutch husband‚Äù that night and we were ‚Äúmarried‚Äù by the DJ on the dance floor. I couldn‚Äôt have dreamt up a more hedonistic, fun, once-in-a-lifetime experience if I had tried. This fragrance has bottled that entire experience for me. From the top notes, to the heart, to the dry down, I feel like I‚Äôm on that party boat again, touring the city. The patchouli and tobacco were the first partiers to arrive. I‚Äôm not a huge patchouli fan, having been around the Berkeley locals who drench themselves in it, so I was a little worried, but this is probably the best patchouli note I‚Äôve encountered. It‚Äôs so perfectly blended with the tobacco that it gives the tobacco a rich, smokey depth. I was actually surprised that there is no incense note because that‚Äôs what I got, but not head shop incense, but the same smokiness that you find in vintage Habanita. The sticky black cannibis note and the dark chocolate heart is what I fell in love with. That lasted only about an hour and I wish it would have lasted much much longer, although, it was such a fun ride while it lasted. The dry down on me was ebony wood with coffee and a lingering smokiness; exactly like that warm happy feeling you get when you go home after a great party, having met some incredible people that you just know are going to become great friends! Just, wow. Thank you PG for that incredible adventure.', 'Funny thing. On my skin it`s hemp, hemp, hemp. A little bit later, when the perfume settled down, it started to smell exactly like in the horse stables! I know this smell too well since I`m doing horse riding regularly. Well, I absolutely adore the stables` smell but I`m not sure I would like to smell like it myself. Though I admit that the hemp note makes me hilarious!', 'A spectacular piece of perfume, on that little piece of paper at the department store. Sweet, woody, spicy, smoky, creamy - it has everything in wonderful harmony. And that quirky cannabis twist! But on my body ... just flat and dull. Nothing like it was intended. In this specific case I fully blame my skin and congratulate those who get the full ride with Coze. You lucky people! I must also give PG credit for the classy bottle design and overall graphic profile.', ""A little bit too sweet for myself-- but I keep coming back for another sniff. It's like a sumptuous dessert that I know I shouldn't have but keep eyeing just the same. If I had a BF I'd make him wear it."", 'To test Coze is like to enter in a Indian caf√©, smoky and a little shabby, with notes of coffee, bitter chocolate, patchouli to start and then a culinary note, a sort of maceration already smells in kitchens in Tamil Nadu (southern India). A kind of menthol flavored oil they use to store food. Spices come quickly, it is good and so it gets very hot, without Lassi for calm it down. There is also Sandalwood and Vanilla but it has nothing of a pastry, it is a pure spicy oriental (India whips nose) perfect for those who already know niche compositions. The PG range is frankly not very avant garde but this one is a must try', ""Very disappointing. It certainly isn't sweet - the pepper and what must be the ebony have completely dominated what 'bean' products there were meant to be in here. It's brash, dusty, unforgiving and,, 'chocolate' included they say? Must be joking! My Note List: Blend - Spices, cardamom, pepper, chilli, strong woods and dry patchouli. 'True alternatives to all those mass-market products, with their bland, standardised formats aimed at winning over vast numbers of customers, Pierre Guillaume's creations exhale their strong character with distinct and immediately recognisable scent identities that make no compromises.' Says the blurb at the back of my carded Coze sample. I have always never been taken by product advertising but I never mind products giving an elaborate or sensationalist descriptions of themselves - it's all in the free-spirit of intent of advertising a (hopefully) hard-worked product after all. So to have PG so boldly and overtly claim to dismiss the competition not only sets a tone of defiance, it brings immediate doubts into my mind of , is this Parfumier really concentrating on his/her own product? This is my 1st test of this house and sadly it's - quite saddening putting it nicley. It opens with an overwhelming blast of heady pepper, spice and woods. It's almost like I stepped into a boxing ring! Pierre has certainly got the 'uncompromising' bit correct for me! It's 'character' is one that totally burns up my nose,, I simply cannot disern any fine, soothing points or the finer ingredients I was looking for here - the Hemp, Coffee and Cacao. It's certainly unique and, er, different - but so it Black Afgano which is a Tour de Force in rare Opulence, and brooding woody-sweet accords. This swiftly becomes an overbearing woody spice lotion (unsweetened cardamom?) that refuses to put this reviewer at ease at any one moment. The ingredients are very fine, but that just makes this waste of a collection of rare ingredients all the more painful to even contemplate purchasing. Nice try Monsieur Pierre, but I think I'll be dispensing my hard cash on a 2nd bottle of 'generic, mass-market' Creed Aventus, if you don't mind. Not for the feint - try -and buy if you dare. 4/10."", ""I don't have the gift of writing some of the other reviewers have but I will say this is a lovely scent.

It lasted less than a hour."", 'When I first smelled this, I was stunned ‚Äì dark chocolate, coffee and hemp. Lovely poison. I smell strong tobacco note. And fortunately ‚Äì no cloves detected.

You can smell bitter cocoa and a clear note of cannabis with soft clove. I like this and find it an excellent choice if you like your perfume not to be too sweet. Somehow obscure and refined.

Still ... a great one to have. Pretty identifiable among its cousins. It stays loooong and its sillage is ok... I think this is pretty safe even with its twists. I'm sure no one will come up telling you you're a junkie. Not because of the perfume at least lol."", 'Coze offers both that fresh, moist feel of a close-fitted evergreen forest canopy and the dry, herbal tone of a dry forest floor.

There is slight heavy cholocate smell, but all else is burried under clove.  I do like medicinal smells, but this is too much for me, I feel myself almost paralysed by clove', ""I don't like cloves, but the way it is presented here is distinct and not overpowering. Coffee, tobacco, and pepper start to come through after an hour or so. It is unisex, but has just a touch more sweetness than what I would consider a typical male fragrance.

I could wrap myself in a soft sweater or blanket with this scent sprayed on it and be instantly comforted, ""Coze\'-like.', 'The first spray of this one provides a ton of pepper and paprika. Enough to incapacitate the nose for the rest of the day. I was looking for chocolate and vanilla in there, but in vain. Coz√© on my skin it remains dry, woody, very peppery, raw. Does not smell like comfort at all; on the contrary, there is something unsettling about it. It is a scent of old room with wooden furniture where someone used to smoke pipe very often. The room in no longer used, hence the dust and powderiness.  I am a bit on the fence with this one... I am quite intrigued by it, but I find it too dry. Some ingredients I was really excited about never made an appearance, and some of the ones I am not a fan of are actually really strong. Coz√© is definitely something different, and shows that Guillaume is skilled in working with various ingredients, but it is not enough for me to fell in love with.', ""Coz√© opens dark, smoky and dusty with coffee, desweetened dark chocolate, woods, prominent patchouli and a slight boozy bourbon note. Spices join the party in a while adding depth and mistery to this warm composition. In the drydown I still detect a remarkable patchouli note together with dark woods, sandalwood and hints of vanilla. While Coz√© is often listed as a gourmand, I more get it as a sort of dirty spicy oriental that will appeal to fans of the most challenging compositions by Maitre Parfumeur Et Gantier, Parfum D'Empire and a bunch of Lutens. If you're into fresh and clean fragrances you should carefully stay away from this, for all the others, this is great stuff. Maybe not as much unconventional as they want us to believe but still highly recommended. Rating: 8/10"", ""Dry chocolate, coffee, pepper and a little metallic smoke to open, warming up with hints of vanilla. Coze, cosy? With this combination of notes, I thought I'd get that. But somehow the scent remains rather aloof and never manages to captivate me, feeling rather dry with the delicious scent of second-hand smoke that never gives me its intended effect. I think the addition of pimento is also what makes Coze stand out from other fragrances--rather bitter, dry and suggestive of a metallic numbing effect like chewing on a dried clove bud. And in combination with hemp, perhaps adding to the 'tarry' accord that SNS mentions. As it's rather cold today, I imagine that this would unfold and deliver more depth if my skin were a little more humid. Even if it did though, and albeit it original and likeable, the initial impression doesn't grab me enough to want to retest as I don't imagine myself wanting to wear this."", 'The cynic in me looks at the notes and says this is brazen attempt to combine all the comfort scents of humanity- coffee, tobacco, cannabis, vanilla.

Upon application, Coze opens with a somewhat harsh, confusing burst of pepper that gives way within seconds to reveal the warmth of chocolate, coffee and tobacco - Ah yes, those comfort scents, but it develops so beautifully and with such grace and subtlety that it really does live up to its name. It is like a soft blanket, a warm embrace, or the feeling of coming home.  I have been looking for a scent with tobacco and considered Tom Fords Tobacco Vanille a little too masculine. Although off beat, IMO Coze is a good option for those who feel TV is too heavy yet want a little wisp of tobacco in the background.

After about 15 minutes, the unpleasant medicinal screech subsides and things get much drier and smokier. A thick cloud of hashish invades my nostrils, through which I can smell musty wood, leather furniture and dank, oily patchouli. Reminds me of a past visit to Christiania, the infamous commune of weed-smoking hippies nestled in the center of Copenhagen.

I can only smell citrus and herbal notes, nothing to tone down the citrus fragrance but luckily the woody dry down is so much better but not too impressive that I would bear the sharp, headache-inducing top notes.

Pleasant but nothing special..More male than unisex.', ""I revisited this fragrance recently. Still not my cup of tea... it's really what you can see in the notes, cedar wood, salty food-like coriander, with the sweet tartness of yuzu, and the cleaniness of lavender. The patchouli gives it a little bit of sweetness, but it's rather airy. The smell reminds me of nature, which is good, but also has some synthetic smelling elements. I think it's a good signature scent if you like it, but make sure to sample it on your skin, because the coriander might come across skanky / sweaty, or if you just came from an arabic restaurant's kitchen"", 'It\'s amazing that, as much as I hate coriander in food, I can like its use in perfumery. Eau de Cartier Concentr√©e is the perfect example of how you can use coriander well: it gives a green and fresh kick to yuzu (which is one of my favourite citrus notes) making it ethereal and airy, bordering aquatic, and providing 15 minutes of glorious olfactory enjoyment.  Enter the middle notes: the aromatic shoulder provided by the lavander, which plays in the background here, helps maintaining the fresh, herbal quality of the opening, while the green violet leaf accord continues the theme provided in the opening by the coriander. Again, there is a certain ""liquid"" quality to this accord and I have to agree with fellow reviewer commenting that this reminds a bit of a fresh wood after the rain or something to that effect; somehow, reminiscent of Lalique Encre Noir Sport.  Going into the base, the clean and sweet musk comes up pretty quickly, suggesting fresh clean linen, while a patchouli that, to me, smells more like green vetiver or something, continues the green facet of this scent until it disappears from your skin after 3/4 hours - longevity is not great here. Its versatility is not great due to the longevity - and I\'m left with the question whether this concoction is purely unisex or steering more on the feminine side: I\'m erring between the two and cannot decide where this one belongs, although this doesn\'t deter me from wearing it when I\'m in the mood. Nice design bottle - clean, simple and understated. Well done, Cartier. Strong like.', ""Sorry but I feel it so generic, had a sample from Notino and I'm not interested enough to buy it... It smells like a glass of water with cucumber slices... and after an hour it has disappeared"", 'All scent notes in this are detectable to me, which is pleasing, as a novice perfumer.  Unisex, but definitely leans masculine. It would smell better on my fianc√© rather than myself. Upscale and fresh. It reminds me of a day spent sailing around New England, tailored suits, and relaxing in a bathrobe in bed on a sunny morning.', 'Truly unisex fragrance.

Great for hot and humid weather for all ages. Expensive smelling.', ""To me, this is a unisex version of She Wood Velvet Forest. It's not exactly the same, but they share a similar vibe, the smell of air and plants after rain. The rain is a bit heavier in Velvet Forest, the flora is a bit denser. In Eau Concentree you can smell the earth and earthy woods. It's a beautifully made and uncommon perfume."", 'A fresh summer fragrance. It actually consists of a good mix of everything: citrus, spice and v√©tiver. The combination isn‚Äôt chaotic though, it‚Äôs just the right amount of everything. At the same time I feel like it walks a fine line between originality and redundancy. I don‚Äôt want to say it smells too clich√© because it doesn‚Äôt but at the same time there‚Äôs nothing special about it. Very safe and very fresh fragrance that could be easily worn on a hot summer day or even to work. A little bit too polite though.', 'I agree, this fragrance is super underrated. Yuzu-centric juices tend to be on the weaker side, along with all the other citruses. Here, though, it shines through long and bright! And pairing it with airy-musty violet leaf and aromatic lavender works brilliantly: the accord is bright, sparkling, earthy, and herbaceous. The first freshie in a long, long time that has surprised and delighted me. Unisex, warm-weather, any age.', ""This is crazy...in my experience, Eau de Cartier Concentre√© along with a very few others (including Acqua Di Parma Oud, Tuscan Leather and Santal 33) has a really potent staying power. I applied one spray on my right hand to test it, washed my hands twice and I can still smell it. Fragrances usually don't last a long time on my skin, but this one... boy it lasts forever, however it sits very close to the skin. I think this one is very underrated. It's so fresh, spicy and woody at the same time. Very elegant and easy to wear IMO. It's marked as unisex but I see it more leaning towards the masculine side. Can be a perfect daily scent for almost every occasion and season."", 'Absolutely love the deft balance between violet-forward floral, tart citrus and very light woods - occupying a profile that hovers between the likes of GIT (florals) and your basic designer citrus aquatic (Burberry the Beat comes to mind). This is one of those scents that express the definition of clean, fresh and uplifting. For me, this leans masculine, but only just so. It\'s one of those quintessential ""just out of the shower"" easy grabs.  But sadly, it\'s all too fleeting. It goes on light, and stays light. Then it just fades away. On a good day, I might eek out maybe 3-4 hours max - if I\'m lucky. Most days, it\'s more like 1-2. That just makes me sad, as this would otherwise have a regular place in my spring rotation. Maybe it still does, but with some reservations due to performance issues. Solid ""like"" for me. Would be a love, if it had even average longevity.', ""An interesting scent, refreshing in that moist, woody, mysterious style. It WOULD be great weren't it for its performance and sillage. One is poorer than the other. To call that perfume 'concentr√©e' must be a joke. And not a good one. That's a great scent you can wear while at home, because it needs respraying every40-60 minutes."", ""Patchouli base is most prominent.  I get the herbal, specially the violet leaf. The yuzu hits you in the opening. But this becomes a patchouli fest quickly and that's what sticks. Reminds me too much of every clothing shop in the Haight or hairy unbathed women in Golden Gate park. This would be a hit if you worked at a smoke-shop."", ""I found Concentr√©e more icy herbal and masculine than the original on me. More coriander, more patchouli. The roller coaster ride is very similar to the original, it lasts longer, but in a soft projection. The sillage starts heavy, gets stronger spicier, then more moderate floral and later softer woodier. I'm not a fan of this scent. Both the original and Concentr√©e didn't wow me, it lacks a feminine coziness that I'm usually looking for in a floral perfume and violet perfumes like Marc Jacobs Daisy or Lolita Lempicka are more up my alley. I got a sample in a Eau De Cartier vials set (the original, Concentr√©e, Goutte De Rose, V√©tiver Bleu) and beware, they are a pain to use. I can also see some DNA similarities with V√©tiver Bleu, Concentr√©e might be more wearable, but it's just too spicy patchoulish for me. I prefer the lightness of the original over Concentr√©e, they are not the worst perfumes ever, but they are not for me and I gave them away. I don't think this is a blind buy, I suggest to test it before."", ""This little f*cker lasts long but it has weak projection, it becomes a skin scent within one - one and a half hour. It's such a pity because anyway it smells very good. Starts with citruses, the powdery violet gives it some charm and - not much - later it settles down to a very pleasant woody-citrusy base. Some people think it's generic, I think it's better than that. If only it wasn't so faintish."", 'I have to add that after wearing this for a while now i do think it leans slightly masculine.. and the lasting power is quite strong.. lasted whole day of work.. highly recommended.. and no it does not smell like bvlgari man extreme.. just at the initial spray it does remind me of that fragrance.. but not in anyways similar/same..', 'Light and airy.. fresh all the way through.. open with a fresh citrus smell.. from the notes above its yuzu.. but its not like yuzu in leau di issey pour homme which is sharp and piercing.. this yuzu is kind of smooth and slightly sweet.. its synthetic if you smell it up close but on the air its very2 nice.. definately unisex.. violet and lavender also noticable.. not dated at all.. the cedar is present quite early.. last decent for a freshie.. 5 to 6 hours.. project about an amrs length for about 1 to 1 half hours.. does remind me a bit of bvlgari man extreme.. but i prefer bvlgari as its has more character.. if you can get this for cheap.. its a no brainer.. buy it..', ""Nice and Safe...clean and comfortable and to me Boring Reach for this if you need to just smell clean and fresh...like you just got out of the shower...

But it‚Äôs actually a rather cold-herbal-aromatic scent. I don‚Äôt get the aquatics, to me it‚Äôs far more reminiscent of icy mountain air, or a winter forest. I think I would have liked it better without that odd little mint note, but overall it‚Äôs a decent fragrance. Longevity is better than most! Honestly this reminds me quite a bit of Jessie McCartney‚Äôs Wanted. But this one is better blended, less harsh, without the boozy anise/licorice note. A solid like, but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a love yet.  Scent: 7/10 Sillage: 8/10 Longevity: 9/10', ""this is a funny one... starts quite masculine. but then it settles down, and I smell like a mint chewing gum with a touch of patchouli, which I love. It reminds me slightly of Kenzo Air, but not as dry. If you like this sort of fragrance, that you have a hint of it through the day and when you do you feel like 'just out of the shower', you should try this one. an office friendly fragrance, not overpowering, low sillage, lasts about 5-6h if you apply on fabrics. A very close to skin one, you still get compliments on it, though. I like to wear it everywhere due to its freshness. Feels very clean. I love it."", 'This is one of my favorite perfumes, I love it so much! It`s not sweet or powdery, I would rather define it as a cold, clean, and very vivid aroma, combining masculine and feminine notes. Better and stronger than the standard version. Don`t know why but gives me the feeling of freedom and open horizon in a very subtle way. Not obtrusive, mild but yet very powerful. Very good longevity and silage on my skin. Hope they will keep on producing it as it is now very rare in Europe.', ""Fragrance Review For Eau de Cartier Concentree Cartier Top Notes Coriander Yuzu  Middle Notes Violet Leaf Lavender  Base Notes Cedar Patchouli Amber  This is a summer time fragrance made up of citrus, purple florals and patchouli, with the lightest traces of clean white amber.  I thought it would be a unisex citrus scent for both men and women to wear in broad daylight in the summer season but this is clearly a feminine perfume. It's opening is quite strong and long lasting in fact longer lasting than the base notes.  To me it's a strong grapefruit and lemony mandarin scent. It's delicious and concentrated like fruit juice. Smells of bitter sweet citrus, of grapefruit that is actually yuzu. The yuzu is a delectable drink on a hot summer day making this scent easy to wear as a daily casual wear perfume with blouses and tops, shorts, jeans, though it does have a perfumy classy aura. As the grapefruit mandarin lemon yuzu settles down without disappearing, it turns into a distinct lavender and violet. The lavender is stronger on my nose. It's a beautiful lavender. The violet is there but the lavender was apparent to me as I sprayed it on my wrists and neck and could smell it within a few minutes.  The pairing of yuzu and lavender is well blended but not rounded. This comes off as quite linear and simple, clean and fresh, ozonic, something to wear without any frills. The scent doesn't seem to dry to me! When it does dry it's a patchouli that emerges - aromatic, light, soft green patchouli herb. There was almost a neroli quality to it only because the citrusy yuzu is so strong. The amber and cedar are not as potent but there to give it a clean finish. As it is a clean fresh citrus floral without any embellishments. This is lovely on a summer day in hot weather. It's meant to be worn to the beach or in a cool air conditioned hotel in Florida or California. This is a beach scent. I will be wearing this baby to my trips to Florida now that my mom's moving out there for her retirement. Such a pretty summery scent."", 'For me personally, it smells almost identical to Cartier Vetiver Bleu with some additional mint. A bit more interesting than vetiver.', 'is it better than normal version. yes. more green . dry down is better. i loved the violet leaf there. because of that i tried lots of violet leaf based fragrances but no. this one was greater each time.', 'ÿßŸÑÿπÿ∑ÿ± Ÿäÿ≠ŸÖŸÑ ŸÑŸÖÿ≠ÿßÿ™ ÿÆÿ∂ÿ±ÿßÿ° ŸÅÿßÿ™ŸÜÿ© ÿ™ŸÖÿ´ŸÑŸáÿß ÿ£Ÿàÿ±ÿßŸÇ ÿ≤Ÿáÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ®ŸÜŸÅÿ≥ÿ¨ ÿßŸÑÿ™Ÿä ÿ™ÿ®ÿπÿ´ ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿßŸÑÿ®Ÿáÿ¨ÿ© Ÿàÿ£ÿπÿ™ŸÇÿØ ÿ£ŸÜŸáÿß ÿ™ÿ∏Ÿáÿ± ŸÖÿπ ÿßŸÑŸàŸáŸÑÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸàŸÑŸâ ŸÑŸÑÿπÿ∑ÿ± ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÅÿ™ÿ™ÿßÿ≠Ÿäÿ™Ÿá ŸàŸÑŸäÿ≥ ŸÅŸä ŸÇŸÑÿ®Ÿá ŸÉŸÖÿß ŸáŸà ŸÖÿØŸàŸÜ.

Yuzu is an interesting note. I am unaware of any other citrus note that a) shows up so late, and b) lasts so long. It is more of a mid note here.  2. Notice how the ""amber"" here is described as grey amber, which is ambergris, as opposed to the sweet, resinous benzoin/labdanum/vanilla oriental amber. Fyi. Either way, it isn\'t overly prominent to my nose.  3. I personally don\'t get much in the way of cedar. There is a slightly woody dimension here, but I can\'t say what it is -- I keep going to juniper, maybe some vetiver. I do get a dusty, powdery thing, which to me smells like iris, but perhaps it is a very non-floral lavender. The violet leaf is the clear #1 here, and I think the patchouli is very prominent on drydown as well. Violet leaf + Yuzu + patchouli + dry, sharp, junipery wood = big fat love for me. Performance for a light, green, sharp summer fragrance is exemplary.  Quick rant - I think that there are many people who would do well to switch to unscented soap and stop slathering $0.99 Suave lotion all over themselves prior to bashing the performance of every single solitary fragrance. Ahhhhhh I feel better :) This is and Dior Homme Cologne are my two light summer go-to\'s. Love em both. EDIT - it is not iris that I smell - it is the amalgam of the lavender (which is more prevalent upon application than I initially thought) and violet leaf starting to dry down and the yuzu and the patchouli starting to warm up. This has bested Dior Homme Cologne as my summer day-off favorite.', ""I tried this from a tester at Macy's and I wasn't fond of it. I wanted to blind buy based on the reviews and notes but I tried it first instead amd it had a sort of gingery smell that is in some Perry Ellis colognes I've smelled. I don't like ginger in fragrances because they generally have this smell of someone who I had a negative experience with so I associated it with them. The base was sort of nice, it reminded me of the drydown of Versace Man Eau Fraiche but greener. But by the drydown I had already associated it negatively as well with my headache after trying some fragrances so for me this wasn't a pleasant fragrance.

They are quite similar, both in smell and longevity, which is very poor. I was expecting a longer longevity and more projection from an EDT compared to EDM, but it seems they are just too similar, except for slightly more citrus in the JPG Monsieur.  In addition, Carteir concentre gives a slight whiff of old man pants in dry down (very short-lived anyway), not sure if it's the coriander but it's not very appealing either."", ""This is stronger than Eau de Cartier? If this lasts through lunch time, I'll be very surprised. Don't get me wrong, it smells great! But it's really not very strong... I got free samples of this when I purchased Cartier Declaration d'Un Soir Intense.  The scent, to me, is a more airy Mont Blanc Exceptionnel (yuzu vs mandarin). For that reason, I really like it! But because of the fact that I can only smell it with my nose to my skin, I'll probably stick with Exceptionnel.  After continuing to test this, I got a maximum of about 3 hours out of it. I really love this scent, but it just doesn't last. This is literally the shortest lived fragrance I've ever used in my life. So sad."", 'While for some reason it sort of reminds me of a softer, distilled version of Prada Amber pour Homme or Fahrenheit, it first and foremost is what it should be: a concentrated Eau de Cartier.

In 2016 it still exudes modernity, without actually being repetitive and boring unlike most modern scents.

As they say in the automotive world: Fast, Cheap, Reliable. Pick two. That being said, Eau De Cartier Concentree is cheap, reliable, and performs well. The overall effect is of a rather safe ""green"" fragrance; I couldnt even go as far as saying that violet can be identified specifically (at least, not in the way it would be in other, heavily violet-prominent fragrances), but as far as citrus-herbal mashups go, there isn\'t much to complain about here, although there isn\'t much to write home about either (other than the fact that this will last 8 hours). However, first place for summer fragrances goes to Bulgari Aqua Amara. Im not sure what they but in that stuff, but its a nuclear-level citrus bomb. Very impressive.

It has a strong yuzu component, which I like a lot: it is a wonderful cross between the real fruit smells of freshly peeled tangerines and grapefruits. And did I mention it doesn't turn sour? A little bit of coriander picks through giving it just a touch of sweetness, and some individually indiscernible woods anchor it ever so lightly. While it doesn't evolve much, it does get a bit rounder as it settles on the skin.  I agree with other postings: it is not an exceptional perfume. However, it is very well crafted with high quality ingredients. Perfect for those days when you crave olfactory freshness to make you forget that you are walking in a sauna.

The lavender note is subtle; when it comes in, it isn't as intense as in Prada Amber pour homme but just there to give a quiet cleanliness to the fragrance. Speaking of amber - the dry down of the amber and patchouli (as per alpestremonte); freshness and sweetness as per sophywt.  This is not a fragrance that will offend those around you; as a wearer however, there is an aromatic/herbal quality that may not be to your liking - I suspect the transition coriander/violet leaf but I could be wrong. I actually enjoy that a lot. In general, I have some problems of longevity with my skin - not so with this Cartier. I think I got 11 hours. Though the last 4 hours were very much skin level but still noticeable. I suppose if I wore it daily (which I haven't been able to as it is winter here), there may be reason for me to start getting bored with it. I'll update you at the end of summer. If you are in the market for a fresh scent that differs form the standard citrus/aquatic standards, do yourself a favour and give EdC Concentree. Love it! I can't wait for this spring and summer.

I received a sample of this fragrance probably a very long time ago - at least over a year ago. I remember getting a ton of little samples, and this one had me intrigued the least. Well, fast forward some time, and my curiosity gets the best of me (and it's also spring, a pretty day) so let's break out Cartier Concentree. At first blast... a bit much. Heavy on the citrus, and maybe it's just the initial grapefruit/yuzu itself - just m'eh. Seen it done better. The initial spritz is not so good. The drydown, however (which you wait about 5-15 minutes for) is AMAAAAAAAAAZING! I mean the most pleasant citrus smell mixed with clean linen. The way you'd imagine a fresh, linen shirt. Absolutely flawless, stunning, and always proper. I must have sniffed my wrist countless times today. This is signature scent worthy. Beach or opera, fancy or impromptu, it doesn't matter, this will do the job. Absolutely recommended. This long-lasting drydown makes the initial blast worth it. Probably best sprayed in the air out of a shower and walking into it."", 'Cartier EAU DE CARTIER CONCENTREE smells dark green and somewhat woody to me, not really very citrus or aromatic. I rather like this composition, which seems to strike a balance between DECLARATION and ROADSTER. Interesting, given that those two are said to be masculine fragrances, while this one is marketed as unisex.  In some ways, EdC CONCENTREE seems closer to ROADSTER, although it is of course devoid of the minty opening. The drydown of this composition, however, is not tiresome but appealing to me. This would make a nice addition to my collection, I think, as I own nothing quite like it.  EAU DE CARTIER CONCENTREE is definitely worth testing by anyone, guy or gal, it seems to me--provided that they do not despise violet leaf!

Throughout the fragrance, I could felt it changing to a more gourmand scent. It became sweeter and a little bit spicier, but in a very subtle way, where deep down inside we have the woods, which lasts throughout the middle of the fragrance.

Yuzu-centric juices tend to be on the weaker side, along with all the other citruses. Here, though, it shines through long and bright! And pairing it with airy-musty violet leaf and aromatic lavender works brilliantly: the accord is bright, sparkling, earthy, and herbaceous. The first freshie in a long, long time that has surprised and delighted me. Unisex, warm-weather, any age.', '1. Yuzu is an interesting note. I am unaware of any other citrus note that a) shows up so late, and b) lasts so long. It is more of a mid note here.  2. Notice how the ""amber"" here is described as grey amber, which is ambergris, as opposed to the sweet, resinous benzoin/labdanum/vanilla oriental amber. Fyi. Either way, it isn\'t overly prominent to my nose.  3. I personally don\'t get much in the way of cedar. There is a slightly woody dimension here, but I can\'t say what it is -- I keep going to juniper, maybe some vetiver. I do get a dusty, powdery thing, which to me smells like iris, but perhaps it is a very non-floral lavender. The violet leaf is the clear #1 here, and I think the patchouli is very prominent on drydown as well. Violet leaf + Yuzu + patchouli + dry, sharp, junipery wood = big fat love for me. Performance for a light, green, sharp summer fragrance is exemplary.  Quick rant - I think that there are many people who would do well to switch to unscented soap and stop slathering $0.99 Suave lotion all over themselves prior to bashing the performance of every single solitary fragrance. Ahhhhhh I feel better :) This is and Dior Homme Cologne are my two light summer go-to\'s. Love em both. EDIT - it is not iris that I smell - it is the amalgam of the lavender (which is more prevalent upon application than I initially thought) and violet leaf starting to dry down and the yuzu and the patchouli starting to warm up. This has bested Dior Homme Cologne as my summer day-off favorite.', 'This is a real gem. Really clean, fresh and sophisticated. This smells so expensive. You can wear this dressed up and down. In spring and summertime. And it gets me a lot of compliments. Overall a 8 out of 10.', 'Intoxicating blend of sharp citrus, golden coriander and crushed green grass. A long cherished favorite.', 'This is one of my favorite perfumes, I love it so much! It`s not sweet or powdery, I would rather define it as a cold, clean, and very vivid aroma, combining masculine and feminine notes. Better and stronger than the standard version. Don`t know why but gives me the feeling of freedom and open horizon in a very subtle way. Not obtrusive, mild but yet very powerful. Very good longevity and silage on my skin. Hope they will keep on producing it as it is now very rare in Europe.', ""I found Concentr√©e more icy herbal and masculine than the original on me. More coriander, more patchouli. The roller coaster ride is very similar to the original, it lasts longer, but in a soft projection. The sillage starts heavy, gets stronger spicier, then more moderate floral and later softer woodier. I'm not a fan of this scent. Both the original and Concentr√©e didn't wow me, it lacks a feminine coziness that I'm usually looking for in a floral perfume and violet perfumes like Marc Jacobs Daisy or Lolita Lempicka are more up my alley. I got a sample in a Eau De Cartier vials set (the original, Concentr√©e, Goutte De Rose, V√©tiver Bleu) and beware, they are a pain to use. I can also see some DNA similarities with V√©tiver Bleu, Concentr√©e might be more wearable, but it's just too spicy patchoulish for me. I prefer the lightness of the original over Concentr√©e, they are not the worst perfumes ever, but they are not for me and I gave them away.

Some fragrances are just pleasant for you, so you end up developing a bond with them, sometimes unexpectedly stronger than with the ones you think you SHOULD love. Looking back at my almost 20-year-old hobby, there are just a couple fragrances that I\'ve developed such genuine attachment to. Vettiveru is one of them. As a fan of the note, I do appreciate my other vetivers, i.e. Guerlain\'s, Givenchy\'s, Lalique\'s, Chanel\'s and so on, but it is this unassuming CdG that makes me, well, happy. I guess it just highlights the facets of vetiver that I personally find most pleasant. It\'s neither super friendly and streamlined like Creed\'s Original Vetiver or Mugler\'s Cologne, nor is it dark, brooding and rooty, like, say, Jovoy\'s Private Label. It might sound like it\'s the boring middle-of-the-road one-size-fits-all affair, but it\'s not. I think that Vetiver Extraordinaire and Sycomore EDP are the closest comparisons, but at the same time they are a tad too posh and polished, and I\'m usually not that person. To me, vetiver has always been the scent of a handsome yet approachable man, the one who smiles wholeheartedly and may be a bit rugged around the edges, but never to the point of crudeness. That\'s Vettiveru. (Btw, I\'m reviewing the old version, but Vettiveru2 is on its way to me; if I find the differences noteworthy, I\'ll let you know)', ""i've been trying to get my hands on this for ages as it's not available anywhere in japan so i went to the cdg store as soon as i got to berlin and the sales associate told me he just sold the last bottle boooooooo !!! he brought the tester from the back to let me try it though, and i have to say if there was a bottle left it definitely would've come home with me! this is one of cdg's more crowd-pleasing scents; there's nothing off-putting or too daring here. just a really well-done, dry and neutral vetiver with slight citrus hits. such a good summer fragrance as it's really light and airy. i get minimal to no projection on this scent and i can't imagine people outside my immediate vicinity would be able to pick this up; i actually have a hard time smelling it on my skin initially and only get faint whiffs when it dries down. that might be a strike against performance for some people but i think it's pretty in line with performing as an edc"", ""PLEASE STOP COMPARING EVERY VETIVER PERFUME/COLOGNE TO ENCRE NOIRE; THEY ONLY SHARE THE NOTE OF.....VETIVER, THEY HAVE NO OTHER SIMILARITIES.

The price is right too."", 'A freshie vetiver, brightened and cleaned up with bergamot and neroli. The vetiver here is dry, bushy, but not skunky. Cedar wood gives it some grounding and warmth. Although quite mild in profile and wearable by most, I still perceive this to be a more masculine scent. This is a great hot-weather signature for a citrusy vetiver lover.', ""I had finished a 125ml bottle of the original version some 10 years ago, and quite liked it. When i learned that it was launched again under the name of Vettiveru2, of course i had to buy it a soon as i could. The scent profile is pretty much the same, just that the floral aspect mainly coming from jasmine, is toned down in V2, and it's more closer to Encre Noire style vetiver smell now, but sure not dark as the aforementioned. Still, a very good choice for 125ml - 45 ‚Ç¨ retail price"", ""First some comparisons if you're browsing through good vetiver fragrances: This is surprisingly similar to Guerlain's Vetiver, which is a fantastic fragrance, but feels a little mature. They both share an aromatic spice element with neroli and bergamot to freshen it up. Guerlain is primarily nutmeg and a little tobacco, while this is cardamom. There's something absent here that doesn't let this feel as dated though and I imagine it's any number of notes that contribute to Guerlain's powdery spice box feeling along with the absence of civet.  It's also kind of similar to Encre Noir and I have a hard time telling which one I like more. EN has no floral aromatics, but a subtle cypress top note. It feels slightly darker and more damp, as well as sweeter and creamier. It's a more minimal and natural framing of vetiver. It also feels less dense and a little fresher because of that. That being said, the differences are still on the edges of the core aroma, and anyone smelling you from a distance and possibly yourself would probably identify each scent as generally the same vetiver. In quick succession on my testing strips they leave a very similar impression. I've tested both and since they're at a price point which enables judicious spraying, I'd say performance can be matched easily, with a slight edge to V2. V2 also feels like a slightly more complete perfume with the extra notes. Overall it's really beautiful and might win over the other two options I mentioned above because it falls on a perfect middle ground. Fresh, grassy and earthy with a subtle floral-spicy edge. Also primarily vetiver, which will please vetiver fans by not getting lost in other heavy citrus or base notes. You'll have to like cardamom though."", 'Not much to say; it starts with a burst of citrus, neroli and vetiver. Dries to a light, slightly earthy vetiver. Lasts OK(up to 6-7h), with weak projection. Better for spring or cool summer days/nights imo. Not bad with ¬£45 for 125ml.', ""A classic cologne that uses vetiver and neroli as the star players. This is energizing and will wake you right up if you're feeling sluggish. Manages to be bright and dirty all at once. I think this would be great for someone who loves the invigorating scent of 4711 but wishes it had any sort of staying power. Clean, grassy, summery and stimulating."", ""I've been wearing this a lot since the weather has turned hot & humid. I like earthy. smoky, woody, incense type scents typically, but that is not going to cut it in 90F temps with 70% plus humidity. Enter the brightness of Vettiveru 2, with it's balanced citrus, white floral, and uplifting clean vetiver.  That said, I still like whatever I am wearing to have some earthy and woody depth to it. This is where Vettiveru 2 really succeeds for me. It blends the clean, refreshingly light notes of the opening with the depth of cedar, with a hint of spice and musk on the drydown. The vetiver stays present to my nose throughout nearly the whole life, only losing out towards the end, when I can only smell vague musky cedar (which is a nice skin scent). I am not a vetiver expert, but I have smelled some standards (guerlain, encre noire, malle, as well as a few different essential oils) and this is one of my favorites.  To me, this is the antidote to a heavy day- whether that be when the air feels heavy with heat and humidity...or when just your mood is heavy. This is refreshing in a way that is not superficial, but full of subtle depth that reveals itself as your body and atmosphere change. This is a nice blast awake in the morning, or mid afternoon mental refresh for me. Overall this is a classic cologne style, and vetiver forward fragrance for modern sensibilities. An easy reach that would work for many occasions, yet is not typical or generic. 100% would recommend if you are looking to explore vetiver, or are looking for a year round, multi-faceted, multi-use fragrance. If you liked Guerlain Vetiver or Encre Noire, but they were either a bit too old-fashioned or too heavy/dark give Vettiveru 2 a shot in the same affordable price range."", ""I didn't try the original formulation, so I can't compare the two. But I got a sample of Vettiveru 2 a couple weeks ago and I can't stop reaching for it. Extremely comforting; somehow both loud and gentle, warm and cool at the same time. It's fascinating but not mind-blowing; a lovely, everyday scent for me."", 'The relaunch of this series does not include the 500ml / spalsh / re-fill version, which is understandable (given the absurdly low original price), but a shame. Also, the quality of the vetiver is no longer the same as in the first version, but still ok, still cheap for what you get. Evaluation of the original version: complex aromatic vetiver in the structure of the cologne without precedent; a typical futuristic/synthetic CDG twist that makes a difference. The added cedar is similar to Standard / Artek. I do not see a suitable replacement for that one, although the similarities with other vetivers cited here by others are quite a few. More sophisticated than EN, more universal than Sycomore, more modern than Guerlain and Carven. In short a masterpiece.', 'A superb Vetiver cologne with staying power of EDT. I am using the first version (before they started using a different type of vetiver). I prefer this to Guerlain\'s vetiver, because this is lighter, more summery, less ""mean"", and I detect some lovely anise in it. It is also greener, and sometimes smells a bit like the wonderful Creed Vetiver. An excellent cologne, with a very good price tag, a must have year round.  9/10', ""THE ‚ÄòDIGITAL‚Äô VETIVEREXPERIENCE: Welcome to the absurd outdoors! This is easygoing and earthy fresh blast of natural cologne that‚Äôs a shapeshifter on skin for the first 15 mins. A flash of green turns peppery, then earthy into leathery, rubbery, then to burnt rubber‚Ä¶ making me feel like someone played a practical joke on me - I asked for natural vetiver but what it delivered was way more edgy and urban! So brilliant I had to laugh!!  After 30 mins it settles as a rugged little fresh musk with a smokey, earthy feel. Like synthetic soil, as if a computer programmer inputted a sample & it popped back out as 1s and 0s. It‚Äôs got a faint Fahenreit feel with a violet leaf like accord that smells a bit like petroleum too - oh and a fair bit of ISO E. It's like a deliberately synthetic, urbanized and rubberized version of Malle‚Äôs Vetiver Ex! More of an odor than a scent. Wacky but entirely lovable because it‚Äôs a composition with charisma. VERDICT: A must try modern vetiver. Much more convenient solution than sleeping the night in the forest and washing yourself with wet leaves. Ironic take on a back to nature cologne, a natural cologne that smells diberately synthetic which is most of it‚Äôs charm! Malle‚Äôs VE is my top vetiver right now and as entertaining as this is, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm ready for my vetiver to be converted to 8 bit and saved to floppy disk!"", 'I was wearing Vettiveru 2 all day yesterday. The Vetiver has that cooling sensation, bitter-skin-cream-made-from-plant-stalks kind-of smell that I like so much. Smells really light but also a bit oily. Think Guerlain but without the lemon and nutmeg. The jasmine adds just enough of a feminine twist to make it young and intriguing, rather than out of place, on a man. It‚Äôs also a bit salty with the neroli and jasmine, like summer holidays on a green, unspoilt coastline... It‚Äôs very well-rounded, but not as sophisticated as Sycomore, which is more complex and richer, but makes me feel underdressed every time I‚Äòm not wearing It with a white shirt and blazer... If you are looking for a dressed-down Sycomore, this would be a good candidate. A bit like a ‚Äòhoodie vetiver‚Äô - but it smells classy, too, if you dress up. I feel it goes with me, not my wardrobe, and I like that. Very friendly, never a dull moment. On my skin it projects well for about an hour to 1.5 hours per spray. Lasted about 6-7 hours witth 4 sprays. The skin scent it leaves is reactivated every time you sweat a little, and would smell crazy sexy on someone‚Äôs neck, I feel. PS. After buying it, i feel honesty demands an edit. I can now see how this is similar to Encre noire, as some reviewers have noted. The vetiver used gives a nice impression in the beginning, but dries down quite spineless, a tad sour and thin... Just like in Encre noire. I don‚Äôt know much about the specifics of perfumery ingredients, but it seems like little natural vetiver went in here. At any rate, the note compares unfavourably to other vetivers i have/had, in terms of what a vetiver lover may like his favourite basenote to smell like, and is only a shadow of vetiver oil. The late drydown is a chemical mess of curdled milk. This is still a very nice combination of notes. Just don‚Äôt expect *too* much more than you‚Äôve paid for. ;)', ""Late Summer Cologne (Mark Buxton, 2002) Scentrack: Bobby Hebb - Sunny I have to declare Vettiveru is one of the best colognes I have ever tried. It's sunny, complicated, fresh and has superb longevity. It opens with brisk neroli and bergamot followed by fresh, earthy but clean vetiver and soft note of white flowers.

Easy to wear, goes well for casual occasions or refined ones. I own L' Eau de Lalique and they have a similar vibe, Vettiveru is more woody. Perhaps that's the reason why I'm not thrilled about this perfume. But in any case, this is a good fragrance. Enjoyable and easy to wear."", 'A great choice for daily elegant.. Its not complicated scent. Soil, greens a little bit citrus and result: in my opinion perfect combination . I want always handy this scent.  Scent 8.5/10 Sillage 6.5/10 Longevity 6.5/10', ""Sprayed the last amount of the sample vial for this review.  It reminds my of the Vetiver used in Laliques Encre Noir (also Encre Noir sport) that is dry and dirty as hell and I like that. But the opening also resembles the strong scent of dried paprika/chile. Like when you take you nose down a huge spice jar with sweet paprika. It gets a kick in the nuts from the spices and generally seem to be a safe and nice choice worthy for the Comme Des Gar√ßons name.  I do like this perfume but I would prefere to just use Encre noir since it's cheaper and does almost the same job flawlessly. Overall Rating 5/10 / /"", ""Vetiver with some extra kick (neroli, pepper, cloves). The clove note is a favorite of mine. It's not a big part of this scent, but it's nice to catch a hint of it in a summer scent."", 'A very nice dry and arid vetiver contrasted with a freshness from neroli and bergamot. As time moves forward a little pepper and woods come into the fray.  A worthy vetiver fragrance!', ""Once you're initiated into the world of niche fragrances, it's easy to forget that simple can be beautiful. Such is the case with series 4 from CdG. These fragrances are almost criminally undervalued - if only because they are rather traditional and available at such reasonable prices. All three of them are wonderful, but Vettiveru is my clear favorite due to my unabashed love of vetiver. I generally reserve my vetiver fragrances for cooler, transitional weather. Guerlain in the Spring, Sycomore in the Autumn, etc. But Vettiveru is the only vetiver-based fragrance that I really associate with warmer weather; I would go so far as to call it tailor-made for the Summer. Here, CdG focuses on the peppery, grassy nature of vetiver rather than accentuating the woody and smoky facets of the raw material. The effect here is both effervescent and refreshing - who would have thought that vetiver was a perfect companion for neroli? The combination almost approximates the smell of fresh ginger - nice in and of itself. This is very much a skin scent (it's cologne after all) but is also deceptively long lasting - perhaps 8 hours for me. Every vetiver fan should have this, even if only for reference - it's $60 for 125ml! Last, I would note the incredible irony of the Cologne series. CdG was and perhaps still is the leading house of avant garde perfumery - they've created fragrances intended to replicate the smells of ink, wet pavement, gunpowder, ice cream, and virtually every type of wood imaginable. And yet they've also managed to create three of the most natural smelling colognes I've ever encountered. If you smelled these blind, you would NEVER guess they were CdG. I find that impressive, and it reaffirms that the CdG line has substance as well as style."", ""Opens up spicy and strong for the first 5 minutes. After that it calms to a clean vetiver with a bit of lemon and white flowers. It's a linear scent that doesn't last a long time. Very pleasant smell. Scent: 8.5/10 Longevity: 6/10 Projection: 4/10"", ""Hats off to CDG for Vettiveru it's a very good Vetiver, opens a bit green and fresh along with citrus, then a clean, calm drydown which is peppery and very pleasant indeed. The key here is to judge the longevity by concentration and when you take that into account it is okay. Same goes for the price considering how much juice you get and it should be used in an accordingly liberal fashion. The scent itself is great but by no means the best vetiver I smelled..It's what I expected really...another great fragrance from Comme des Garcons."", 'While reading the reviews, I realized that this was built up to be a holy grail of Vettiver scents. It does have a great vettiver beginning, but loses track along the way, only to vanish within two hours or less. Not one of the best, not even close. Sorry CdG, I still love you anyway!', ""Vettiveru is a good vetiver cologne, although it smells somewhat synthetic and doesn't last very long. Vetiver lovers undoubtedly cherish it as Comme Des Garcons's super-fresh entry in the canon of contemporary vetiver scents, and I can understand their enthusiasm - it is citrusy, green, a little spicy in a smooth, clovey sort of way, and very nicely balanced (not too much fruitiness from the bergamot, just enough vetiver, and some black pepper to transition to the musky clove in the base). Ultimately though I think you're better off wearing Guerlain Vetiver. It's cheaper, just as well made, just as fresh, and lasts longer. Pairing vetiver with tobacco is more inspired than mating it to pepper and clove anyway."", ""I agree with Mossy. This is a nice clean vetiver, a little sharp, a little nutty, a little green, a good bit of citrus. I think for the price of the big bottle it is worth it. It is great for church, interviews, intimate meetings, even long trips (air and car) where you don't want to overpower people yet feel scented and enjoy a hint of an aroma.  I like this very much and it contributes greatly to my current lifestyle. Again nothing great its just perfect."", 'Lightened up vetiver. Not too sharp, not too green...just right. Has a touch of musk mixed in with it that adds a little more freshness. Unfortunately it dries down to just vetiver on me.', 'It\'s been a while since I previously tried this, but I still remember it being sweeter and more floral than other vetivers. It opens very crisp and grassy, with what almost seems like a hint of mint. Much like Bobby Jones, it really makes me think of a lawn or a golf course. It\'s quiet in a kind of balanced way, which I\'m somehow convinced is due to their not using any of the sharper-smelling natural oils (definitely a synthetic vibe!). Later on there gets to be more soil and less grass, almost straying into the violetty woods regime of He Wood and its flankers. It\'s not as strong as I recalled, but then I guess they\'re putting it in a ""cologne"" series since it\'s an EdC? Toward the end I start to recognize the inky component of the vetiver, but I still feel like I somehow missed something here. I thought I recalled it being more natural, but it\'s still decent, and it seems to recover strength and return to a more normal vetiver smell by the end. I\'m giving it a reluctant thumbs-up in part because of how cheap it is and how long it lasts.', 'terrific. green fresh woody frag without being fake or sweet. a fresher more distinctive vetiver than many others out there', 'this is such a lovely fragrance to wear, how could a man not want to smell this way ?. I do see this more masculine , however I do not think a woman that smelled of this would be off putting at all in fact quite good and natural. a delicious refreshing take on a vetiver based cologne one of those you just slap on your body and roll.. refreshing and uplifting.  you can use this as a splash if needed. price point is excellent for the amount of juice you get. A worthy signature fragrance.', 'So lovely. Dry roots, dandelion and tea. For being a cologne, the longevity is awesome. I can smell it in my hair the day after spraying. The drydown remotely reminds me of Mitsouko EDP (my fav above all!), but that might just be me.', ""Comme Des Gar√ßons Cologne Vettiveru is a fantastic interpretation of vetiver. It goes on crisp, salty, woodsy and masculine; the way that all vetiver scents should smell. I really love Comme Des Gar√ßons as a niche brand because they keep it simple. Cologne Vettiveru is no exception. I didn't always like vetiver. To be frank, I was scared to wear it due to its rich, masculine vibes. However, over the years I've learnt to appreciate it and also found ways, as a woman, to wear it with ease.  Due to this fragrance being sold as a splash in cologne strength, I think many assume that it will be lacking in quality and longevity. This is not true. Cologne Vettiveru has so much to offer. Being so versatile is one of its strong points. Like most vetiver fragrances, Cologne Vettiveru has a dry, woodsy feel. It opens quite crisp and grassy on the skin at first, with a refreshing bergamot accord. However, once settled, it becomes a touch more masculine and grounded, with quite a strong dose of white pepper and cardamom.  A very subtle hint of neroli in the heart keeps Cologne Vettiveru unisex, which is a relief for its female wearers. This fragrance is never overpowering, so I would definitely recommend wearing it during Spring and Summer. The tester in the store had a spray top, so I actually spritzed on this fragrance to review it. I'm not certain as to how it would vary on the skin when applied as a splash. I'm hoping it's not vastly different. All in all, Cologne Vettiveru is an excellent vetiver scent, especially good for beginners."", 'Simply put, one of the best vetiver scents you can buy, especially for the value. Wonderful juice! I have been looking for this gem in the large 500ml flacon for a long while - hard to believe it is a decade-old! This is an under-the-radar scent for most, even vetiver lovers. The sheer beauty and distinction of a classic Eau de Cologne Vetiver is captured here. Alfarom said it right - incredible bang for the buck (quality-to-price ratio is fantastic)! This is not a clean ""vetiver-light"" scent at all...it\'s actually a nice composition that is meant to be applied as true EdC\'s should - splashed-on with confidence and masculine vigor (but don\'t count ladies out on this, as it truly is Unisex)! The note pyramid is more (in my opinion) to what is offered by LuckyScent - a nice citrus opening of fresh bergamot (but not too loud, just enough), vetiver makes a nice bright green appearance at first - a grassy-vibe that is sharp and true-to-form (essence of vetiver) and a shade deeper than one would even expect at this point! Wonderful and fragrant neroli enters late in the top and into the heart...a perfect amount for me and of exquisite quality. Incredibly natural smelling - one knows this is a niche-quality Eau de Cologne with exceptional purity and gorgeous, natural ingredients. I like how the vetiver (at this phase transcends from ""grassy to more rooty""), with the vibrant neroli keeping it bright and still very invigorating - and a hint of pepper enters at this stage, which is brilliant. That accord could be the slight peppery-vibe of the neroli itself, but regardless, it really shines here as an accord. Integration and blend is just wonderful. More depth than one will expect from an Eau de Cologne - and the essential oils will leave a nice rich, silky texture on your skin. The base incorporates a nice wood note - white cedar. I don\'t see a phase here of ""struggle"" between dried brown wood and damp, slightly-dirty green vetiver (as it incorporates a nice, slightly salty vibe that others mentioned) - I see a great balance and integration. The two notes play perfectly together...it\'s what makes this bottle so good. Balance. Harmony. Nothing off-putting or overly dominant at all - this could not be over-applied unless you poured the 500ml over your head! Even then, you would drown a happy man (or woman). ;-)  I have Annick Goutal\'s Vetiver (as a comparison/reference point some have brought up to the very nice salty nuance you get in Vettiveru). Goutal\'s Eau de Toilette, not referencing the current EdC, is not for the timid (I adore it, but it is not for beginners or the faint of heart). This is nothing close to the rich iodine/ocean spray-infused Goutal creation...just a few drops of salty water on the dirty roots here - perfect. A natural vibe added to the portrayal of vetiver in this brilliant scent, but not too strong or anything off-putting. It stays fresh & vibrant for the whole wearing while drying down into a wonderful skin scent that one can layer with more serious Vetiver EDT\'s. After 6+ hours of total wear, it was still there (with a full reapplication after about an hour in as I went light at first to get a better sense of composition, strength, etc.) Then, I stopped analyzing, put down the ""pencil and paper"" and splashed on half a lid full (anyone who has the splash bottle knows that is a full application). Ahhhhhh!!! I just breathed deep for a while and enjoyed a warm, spring afternoon. Temperature today was around 90 degrees Fahrenheit with low humidity during this full wearing (which lasted nicely on my neck, chest, back of hands and arms for over 5 hours). It was a nice skin scent still at that point. If I had worked up a sweat, it would have returned - the beauty of an Eau de Cologne...the good ones reappear when you need them to in warm/hot weather.  Transition to Guerlain (""The benchmark""): At dry down (6 hours +), I have layered both 2000 formulation Guerlain Vetiver (ribbed bottle) and the earlier mid-to-late 90\'s EdT after a day with Vettiveru...it was perfect with both. But, this is a wonderful scent unto itself and one could just as easily reapply more Vettiveru - although I do prefer this in the day, it is very nice on a warm balmy Summer evening. In the end, it is a scent to be adorned anytime one wants to purely enjoy it.  Although I feel it, on my skin, as somewhat masculine - it is entirely unisex on the right, confident woman. Very nice for informal, casual settings. As a true Eau de Cologne, this is for the wearer to appreciate and maybe a foot or so radius of projection. Not a loud, brash, and arrogant scent. This is to be worn with confidence and a bit of attitude. I happened to shave today, but would prefer this with at least two days of facial hair - the scent itself is a bit unclean and brawny on me, but it wears very different on my wife\'s skin (body chemistry is a big part of all scents, especially vetivers). I cannot appreciate a modern EdC Vetiver more than this offering from Comme des Garcons! Awesome. For the office - I wouldn\'t, definitely more casual attire. I don\'t see this as formal...there is too much fun to be had and, more importantly, you want to enjoy the slightly dirty vibe here. This is for someone who enjoys it for what it is - pure pleasure in a bottle, and A LOT of it. For lovers of vetiver - and understand what an Eau de Cologne is and how to use it. Don\'t overthink it...it\'s a gem. Fantastic scent for Spring & Summer (daytime and evening) and wearable on fall and winter days (it wears well & natural with rain - but not cold temperatures) - one of the best money can buy and a must for those of us who adore the magical vetiver root - 9/10! Exquisite...near perfection, for what it is.', 'I can easily say that Vettiveru is a valid candidate to be considered one of the best bang for the buck when it comes to vetivers. An incredibly nice composition that improves the eau de cologne formula with a slightly ""dirty"" vetiver note. The overall effect is quite intriguing with the clean aspect given by the neroli/bergamot/florals combo juxtaposed to a dominant vetiver note that add a earthy/salty vibe that\'s at the same time refreshing and invigorating. Great lasting power, nice projection, very reasonably priced. One of the best ""fresh"" vetivers around. Recommended! Rating: 8/10', 'This was absolutely amazing - warm, cuddly, sensual and really unique. I can only agree that this is not about vetiver how the name states to be, but it\'s not a bad thing, it ""tastes"" just lovely, I would buy this for my man (I\'m a girly girl and I feel like smelling like flowers more) with no doubt. And - it\'s cologne, but it stayed well on my wrist for good 7 hours and many modern EDP doesn\'t even do that. Bravo!', 'Sex in a bottle. Seaweedy, salty, steamy green, roots in the soil. The vetiver is king here, but it is not a deep dark dank vetiver like a wet hole in the soil, nor is it dry vetiver like a sandy bank with broken ivy. No, this vetiver is from the humid tropics of Indonesia, volcanic earth the bedrock for fresh juicy vetiver roots bruised and torn, bleeding sweet perfume from the sinews of the root mixed with some jungle spice carried on a salted sea breeze. Perfect for hot weather, day and night, work and I must say, to not wear this for play is to miss the whole point - it provides the perfect palate for lovers.', 'The time it stayed on me is still too short= = though this one is really great', ""Another of my husband's favorites, this is a deep(for a cologne) ,slightly powdery and salty (like ambergris), dry and fiery orange scent.

The Vetiver has that cooling sensation, bitter-skin-cream-made-from-plant-stalks kind-of smell that I like so much. Smells really light but also a bit oily. Think Guerlain but without the lemon and nutmeg. The jasmine adds just enough of a feminine twist to make it young and intriguing, rather than out of place, on a man. It‚Äôs also a bit salty with the neroli and jasmine, like summer holidays on a green, unspoilt coastline... It‚Äôs very well-rounded, but not as sophisticated as Sycomore, which is more complex and richer, but makes me feel underdressed every time I‚Äòm not wearing It with a white shirt and blazer... If you are looking for a dressed-down Sycomore, this would be a good candidate. A bit like a ‚Äòhoodie vetiver‚Äô - but it smells classy, too, if you dress up. I feel it goes with me, not my wardrobe, and I like that. Very friendly, never a dull moment. On my skin it projects well for about an hour to 1.5 hours per spray. Lasted about 6-7 hours witth 4 sprays. The skin scent it leaves is reactivated every time you sweat a little, and would smell crazy sexy on someone‚Äôs neck, I feel. PS. After buying it, i feel honesty demands an edit. I can now see how this is similar to Encre noire, as some reviewers have noted. The vetiver used gives a nice impression in the beginning, but dries down quite spineless, a tad sour and thin... Just like in Encre noire. I don‚Äôt know much about the specifics of perfumery ingredients, but it seems like little natural vetiver went in here. At any rate, the note compares unfavourably to other vetivers i have/had, in terms of what a vetiver lover may like his favourite basenote to smell like, and is only a shadow of vetiver oil. The late drydown is a chemical mess of curdled milk. This is still a very nice combination of notes. Just don‚Äôt expect *too* much more than you‚Äôve paid for. ;)']"

It‚Äôs kind of difficult to describe, and judging by the list of notes I was expecting it to be smoother and creamier. Anise comes out in the dry down and takes the scent in a better direction. Still, it‚Äôs a weird one with my chemistry.', ""A linear, nice, green, 'dry' and herby patchouli. Sillage okay, it starts out strong and almost masculine-leaning, but quickly settles down. Longevity mediocre; on my skin at least it's hardly discernible after 4-ish hours. Maybe my nose is missing some nuance, but this does not come across as super high quality to me?  I've used up a full 3.4oz/100ml bottle over the course of 2-3 years, and actually mostly used it for layering! Because the fragrance by itself, in my opinion, feels too simple and one-dimensional to wear on it's own. On my skin it's mostly 'just' patchouli, and a generic, dry-ish kind at that. Kind of similar in genre to Jessica Simpson's Fancy Nights? Like what I would imagine a dried bunch of patchouli leaves would smell like.. With some herbs thrown in there. The star anise initially adds some mild whiff of liquorice - but that's gone quite quickly.  Sadly I don't get much of the cedar/vetiver/sandalwood base. All in all, a decent enough patchouli, but not a fragrance I'd ever repurchase. So I cannot understand the price point this sells for in the US? Like $170-ish?! Luckily I bought it for under ‚Ç¨40 so for that price, I was happy enough to use up the bottle."", 'I recently purchased this after getting Psychedlique from Jovoy - the much-lauded, cult-followed Patch that‚Äôs a bit more expensive. I love them both - both are well blended and use patchouli in unique and effective, completely unisex ways. That said, I think I‚Äôm preferring this one: it‚Äôs more refined and elegant. I love the powdery iris and light musks. I am a huge star anise fan and wished I could smell it in here more prominently. But, as with all Duchuafour scents, this is so well blended that it hides in there perfectly, while still lifting the scent and giving it a slight gourmand bent (similar to Psychedelique‚Äôs chocolatey accent). Same goes for the caraway, which I am happy NOT smelling in an obvious way.', 'Patchouli Kitchen. Patchouli Patch smells like an antique kitchen patchouli-zied. Green, earthy patchouli mixed with kitchen-top spices of anise and caraway. It smells literally just like that: patchouli, and food-grade caraway & anise. I personally get more licoricey anise than caraway. Woody, aromatic, licorice. A nice smell. Might be too gourmand to some, as it does smell like like food. Nonetheless, it is quite serious and woody. This would smells beautiful on an older person, think >40 years old. I keep imagining a white-haired, glasses-wearing, well-dressed in home clothes woman in a an antique kitchen, preparing a heartedly meal without making a mess in the kitchen. A very mature, winter time wear. Like', 'Well it smells like patchouli; Its that earthy dirt-like patchouli. The fragrance starts very strong-not very sweet-powdery- woody-a slight spice-the anise is there and makes it real nice. The powder continues, and it gets smoother more mellowed.  The star here is that anise which steers it.......kind.......of......from being simple and boring, and boy does make it a good pairing w that patch. Nice, good for layering, but a tad too pricey.', 'So, I got pulled in by the suggestions here and elsewhere about the animalic, slightly feral and earthy possibilities of this perfume and went in blind for a bottle. In order, I was impressed by it\'s beauty and depth, then disappointed that I came to it hoping for a wild edge, then again deeply appreciative of its complexity. I would trade the words earthy and animalic for ""natural."" Definitely patchouli of the juicy leafy variety (Villoresi, Etro), but equally, I don\'t know, fruity-floral from the osmanthus which I totally get and which makes it unique. It\'s nearly peachy, down to an edible fuzziness. I feel a chic boho San Franciscan Mitsouko here, and I don\'t even mean to be pulling on a patchouli/Haight-Ashbury reference. It\'s really what I think of. Not sure where the anise/fenugreek references fit in, and it\'s not powdery or musky so much as fuzzy hazy. Similar to Mitsouko, I love to smell this. Mitsouko is one of my favorite smells on earth, in fact. But I almost never ever wear it except to sniff on my wrist at bedtime. I won\'t say too feminine (honestly PP is not a million miles away from Quorum in its green outdoorsy sillage), but perhaps it\'s just too... perfume-like. I don\'t subscribe to smelling literally like anything, campfire or roses or horse shit or pencils. But I like to live somewhere in the middle, and full on perfume just doesn\'t make me comfortable.  So this really is one of the best patchouli fragrances out there. Deep but light but totally perceptible and persistent; layered and gorgeous; not chocolatey or pongy and no vanilla or amber. Just an atmospheric, green-yellow, vegetal and slightly ripely peachy floral perfume. Could be for anyone, just not exactly for me. With SMN and Villoresi Patchoulis and Etro\'s Vetiver (not to mention Mazzolari Lui and Patchouli Leaves) on my shelf, I just don\'\'t know if I can keep it. Edit: Couldn\'t let it go. It\'s a keeper. ;P', ""My first introduction to patchouli in a fragrance was  Miss Dior (2012)  and I was immediately smitten! But it was a patchouli that was restrained by the floral and fruit notes. In time I thought I was ready for rugged all earthy patchouli which is why I bought a full (orange) bottle of P.P. which was two years ago and I honestly was not ready for it.  Considering I am very drawn to oriental perfumes, P.P. for me does not reflect me and my personality. It is the earthy tone that deflects me.  Giving it another try today after re-reading the reviews and what I am doing different is layering it with JM- Tuberose Angelica because I needed a bit of a 'lift' from the dense patchouli. As the reviewer below mentioned that it has rather 'wild' aspect to it and I really need something to calm it down a bit and I think I found a way to do it. P.P. is still very intriguing and I will try to know her and her wild side better."", ""The most refined, elegant patchouli there is. Yet, at the same time it is animalic, rich and wild. I am a guy and I enjoy it tremendously. I yearn for this perfume when I don't have it on. This is a praise song to patchouli, but even though it has patchouli as the main star it is not linear at all, and has so many hidden stories. Marvelous."", 'I‚Äôm trying the Patchouli Patch in an older style bottle, and goodness, this is good stuff. It is composed of earthy patchouli, like the vintage oils I have in my cabinet, but is unexpectedly made velvety smooth and softened out with white musk, and made creamy with sandalwood. It‚Äôs complimented with woody vetiver and a kick of anise, for interest, which pierces through with a somewhat minty presence, though nothing is too loud, here. The osthamus is present too, just enough to sweeten the tiniest bit and lend it‚Äôs blossom to the composition, but it‚Äôs not obvious to pick out. This is beautifully composed, and not at all what I expected.', 'The spiced opening is lovely; the anise is an especially well suited partner to the sweet, camphorous patchouli. But after the top notes dissolve, you are mostly left with a very good but very basic patchouli. It calls to mind, as this kind of patchouli usually does, Chinese herbal muscle balms. It smells vaguely fermented, with lots of dirt mixed in. It‚Äôs earthy, medicinal, comforting. It‚Äôs great if you love patchouli, but if it‚Äôs just the smell of great patchouli you‚Äôre after? You can save a ton and just buy a high quality oil instead for much the same effect. Very pretty, but hardly essential.', 'Pretty, pretty, pretty and unique...unmistakable patchouli but with a touch of difference. Definitely not your basic, overwhelming, hippie patchouli oil that you can purchase from the oil fragrance monger at a local street fair. This is patchouli with warmth, elegance and class. This is a definite if you are a patchouli lover (I am not...not a patchouli lover when the fragrance stands alone). I did not get a lot of musk with this fragrance as others have stated. However, the patchouli notes are obviously very apparent throughout. I found this scent to be a very linear fragrance (to my nose, at least), not too complex. Patchouli Patch is a very round, full-bodied, warm, humble, embracing scent. I think the middle notes of vanilla and spice make this scent beautiful without turning it into a gourmand-y mess! Longevity is good...sillage is nice, almost perfect! Definitely worth the price and the experience if you are looking for a traditional patchouli fragrance with a twist!', 'A very comfortable and long-lasting scent. It smells clean and smiling hippy. It is earthy and spicy, I smell plum too. I love it, especially in autumn. I wear it with a denim jacket. My bottle is the old one, with orange label.', ""You have to love patchouli to love this. It's feminine but earthy, almost like patchouli powder. My bottle is the old one with the orange label and orange box, and it lasts about six hours. Newer bottles of L'Artisan scents seem to have longevity problems, but I am ok with the length of time this lasts. Earthy and medicinal, not a soft gourmand patchouli. Just a dry gritty powdery patchouli like the box patchouli incense came in. As a child of the seventies, I get a smell exactly like a head shop stocked with Led Zepplin records, Zig-Zag rolling papers, and Gonesh incense. The spices round it out but do not dominate. The star anise stands out and makes me think of Chinese Five Spice powder. It goes well with patchouli, which definitely rules. Also not a fresh green patchouli. I used to grow patchouli plants just because I love the smell, but no perfume I have tried has that smell. Patchouli stinks, but it is a stink that I happen to love. Yes, it is combined in eleventy dozen million other fragrances, but it's best when it stands alone as it does in Patchouli Patch. Almost forgot to add...If you can find Nubian Heritage Patchouli and Buriti Massage Oil and apply that generously before spraying P. Patch, the effect is gorgeous and it lasts longer. Plus you can stand outside under a porch light in spring and not be bothered by moths."", ""A very nice sweet patchouli, but incredibly weak, and not much of an improvement over all the other samey patchoulis out there. But spray it very liberally and you'll get that nice apple note that patchouli can often provide, along with subtle spices. I'm finally starting to understand the frustration I've seen people have with this house and its performance issues. I don't require big performance, but I do require being able to smell a fragrance I've just sprayed without having to put my nose right on top of it."", ""Having read that dear Patch has been another victim of reformulation I am beginning to kick myself for giving away a 1/3rd used 100ml a couple years back. I had worn it on & off, in colder weather only, for a couple years but admittedly struggled to make it my own despite desiring a proper patchouli pillar in my wardrobe. Until that point I'd had only old Givenchy Gentleman as a representation, although not a bad place to start I dare say. I confess, I'd always rather associated heavy patchouli with a somewhat grungy, hippie vibe - as many have done - and was looking to broaden my olfactive horizons, learning to appreciate this most loved & loathed leaf. And so it was that I dove into Patchouli Patch, M. Duchaufour's creations being firm favourites. But yet it was very yes & no for me, depending on the day and indeed, in a wardrobe weed, I gifted it on to a grateful mate. Now a few years on and I've found myself much more viscerally comfortable with patchouli - even seeking it out subconsciously in new purchases in the intervening years. TF's 'White Patchouli', quite floral & ethereal but fun, and most recently P&P Provence's 'Patchouli Blanc', gourmand-ish but safely not TOO sweet. I was too young to wear Giorgio BH for men back in the day, though its presence was unforgettable, but fell in love with it for myself summer before last and have been enjoying it lavishly since, especially considering it can be had for a song. And therefore now I regret parting ways with Patchouli Patch as I feel I'd relate to her much better now and would like to give her another go, if she hasn't changed too much. I'm yet a patchouli amateur but PP seems, in my recollection, a touchstone and a given for the patchouli pack. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ"", ""I've had this for a few years. I didn't like it because it smelled too feminine to me, and I don't like anise note. After seeking out some great soliflore patchoulis, I purchased Classic Patchouli, Lorenzo Villoresi Patchouli, my favorite, and Boss exclusive Cashmere Patchouli. I began to really like a pure medecinal, earthy Patchouli note, with few embellishments. Well, I started to like Patchouli Patch again. It is patch dominant, but it has a strong floral presence, and spices. It is a creamy smooth patchouli, with some sweetness and flowers. It's for a niche fragrance lover, who loves the patch note, leaning feminine."", 'Edit 7/2024 I purchased an older bottle , the 30ml narrow bottle , on eBay several years ago and it wasn‚Äôt working so I put it in the sell bin. On a whim I pulled it out and now I‚Äôm loving it to death again. I think the sprayer needing a good clearing for one thing but also this actually works much better on me in the heat. This and SMN are still my two favorite patch scents.  I‚Äôve been through three or four bottles of this since 2006. My current bottle- about one quarter full -is about 7 years old. It had definitely been reformulated after my very first bottle because I recall complaining it smelled different at the store where I purchased it. I didn‚Äôt know about reformulations then. In any case I adore what I have still and am wondering if I should wear it sparingly because it is nothing like what recent reviewers are saying. It lasts forever and has big sillage. I‚Äôve tested several other niche patch (histoires, vc&a, le labo, nassamoto, bond st, Nobile) and L‚Äôartisan Patch is superior to all. It‚Äôs the most feminine and well blended imo. If you‚Äôre a patch researcher and you are curious, try to get your hands on an older formulation.(I also LOVE SMN patch which is much more medicinal and hippie chic).', 'Is there patchouli in this?

Strong dislike.', '6/10', ""I gave this high praises in my review below, then durring the Winter cold months, I couldn't stand it, as it suddenly felt so feminine. The earthy patchouli with feminine florals, yuk; like pickles and ice cream. I got very interested in a new Diptyque Patch fragrance called Tempo, just came out last week. I started craving patchouli, and remembered I had Patchouli Patch. I thought I would never use it again. Some fragrances take time, to grow to like them. The opposite happened with P Patch. But now! Maybe with the feeling of Spring right around the corner, and my craving patchouli, as I wait for my sample of Dyptique Tempo, this has come into favor again. It's Patchouli dominant, and I'm getting that earthy medecinal craving satisfied. I think because it's allmost Spring time, the florals don't seem too feminine or out of place any more."", ""This review has been deleted because the site's owners are fascists."", ""As the name suggests this fragrance is heavy on the patchouly. As the logogram (?) above the name suggests (though i have no idea what it means) this is far more than just high quality raw patchouly - it is a monogram of the different facets of patchouly - earthy, woody, medicinal, herbaceous, delicately sweet. But boozy? PP's anisic behavior is certainly one of a great liquor. A very very nice alcoholic treatment I am served here. Overall L'Artisan's take on this popular theme is a natural, complex, melancholic and surprisingly cool patchouly.  I need to give it more wearings during the summer. I believe it will be very refreshing.  My 7th L'Artisan that gets my full marks. Wow! *****"", ""*Sigh* Patch is a favorite, but I didn't look at the ingredients before I ordered this. I don't get a bit of patchouli, but tons of Osmanthus. In this case, it could be much worse as the Osmanthus merely smells soapy. Not sure if I will wear this or not. As it smells on me, it would be nice on a man. Kind of a barbershop soapy smell. Very nice, but on me, not a patch perfume."", ""I love this patchouli perfume! It's so real, such real honest-to-God, in your face patchouli, with all the dirt and herbaceousness, but also so beautifully sweet and soft. It's everything patchouli is, to me. I adore it! It's heavenly, and very very comforting. Deep and so extremely sensual. It's gorgeous! It's fantastic! Yum, yum. Delicious and divine. I feel so good in it. It gives me such a lift, and soothes my jangled nerves (when they need it!). It's a pure balm to my soul. And it lasts super well on me! I love it, it lasts from 5am until bedtime at 10pm (ish), and hardly weakens at all, and goes through various stages of more and less dirty, and sweet and delicate and rugged and smooth; it's so complex and interesting, and it's like going on a delicious journey through the exotic faraway lands. Goodness me I love it!  Patchouli Patch is the most perfect name for this most perfect perfume!"", 'Once this settles it becomes a nice gentle spicy scent. I am sure men can pull this scent off. I am slightly disappointed by this fragrance as it does not seem to take you anywhere while wearing it. I think Al Oudh is a much better creation for a soft spicy fragrance. Having said that it smells very true to patchouli oil. I guess this would be great to use as a layering scent as it does not say so much when worn alone.', 'Usually i make my researches before buying a perfume , but when it came to this potion i tested it by change and i live it from the 1st sniff , it satisfies my crave for patchouli ,  but suddenly i read that its for women , i was like ooops , still i am sniffing myself all the day to feel yes it is only for woman yet i didnt reach that conclusion. It versatile dominant patchouli softened with some anise and caraway but never lost its earthiness , yes i love it and yes i use it , it raises my mood and makes me happy.', ""I keep thinking about the point made by an Asian woman's review here. She said it reminds her of the Asian medicine her mother gave her as a child. I get that a lot, especially in the opening, the patch is very medecinal. I love medecinal notes when done well, very evocative, interesting. I think we L'Artisan lovers like there fragrances because they smell great, but are allso most interesting. I think it is the piquant Osmanthus blossom, loved and used in China. I think this is unisex, it's earthy woodiness makes it masculine, but the sweet and powdery florals ad feminine touches, a very sexy patchouli. I trust Duchaufour's work, as Timbuktu is my favorite L'Artisan frag; and Sartorial, both are in my top five. I'm realizing I like a good Patchuli frag, I love it's particular earthy, herbal medicinal vib. It's like how I love a simple great labdanum fragrance, like Tom Ford Amber Absolute, just some of my favorite scents from nature. At first the patchouli smelled raw, natural, but then it smooths out and you pick up the chocolatey character of the patch. Then one of the florals, has an Apricot fruity nuance. The accord that is made makes the patch smell beautiful, sheer and soft. I love great Amber dominant scents as Ambre Sultan, and Amber Absolute, this patch is different than Amber/ Labdanum, but it has that same raw, natural earthiness I like a lot. This is close to the two best patch frags out there, Chanel Exclusives Coromandel and Dior Patchouli Imperiale. In the overall vote for PP, more people voted like than love. When I checked how the male and female votes went, more men love it, than like, and woman voted more for only like vs love... Interesting. I guess the raw herbal ruggedness of this dominant patchouli scent, make it more of a male fragrance perhaps. Update: On my second day wearing this, I realized I have a new great fragrance. I bumped up my rating to 9/10. I think some fragrances are great, but they have so many notes and to much going on, that's nice sometimes. But this is great perfumery, because it takes a great distilled essence from nature, and just masterfully embellishes it, as Duchaufour has. There is a beauty in the simplicity of PP.

A green powder thing that really bitter but quiet effective. A little dab of it will get a rid of a mouth ulcer within a couple hours. I can smell patchouli (duh!) after awhile. At the end, this perfume is come out as soft & powdery, but I can't get a rid the thought of the bitterness of my medicine.

And if someone told me my first ever Artisan Parfumeur scent would be Patchouli Patch, I would probably not believe them either. This is a very addictive and gorgeous, earthy scent. I initially got it for my sister who did not fancy it and told me to keep it. I sprayed it on my wrist and knew instantly this one is not going anywhere. It starts off with a strong patchouli note with a hint of anise seed and caraway. It stays the same throughout, sometimes emphasising more on the spicy or the woody notes. In terms of development is is quite linear, but to be honest it does not bother me that much.  It is good in terms of projection, but not overbearing or intrusive to the environment. I would say about 2-3 hours after application, this still is present on my wrist, closer to the skin.', ""One of my favorites of the house. I am a big L'artisan fan and this fragrance is no exception. I'm a bigger patchouly lover and this fragrance is totally patchouli. With an almost powdery, but not in a baby powder artificial way, hints of amber and vanilla, and spice. Never too sweet or powdery. Very light and sophisticated, you can smell the quality in the ingredients and the silage and longevity speak to that. Very recently I found the little sister to this perfume at drugstore prices and only go to this one on more special patchouly occasions. With it's younger sister Arthes Essential Patchouli Sumatra, I can let go of the guilt of using L'artisan PP like it's going out of style and can save this for when I'm feeling more fancy and wanting longer projection, which LA definitely has over the sister."", ""Of all of the patchoulis I have tried so far (see my reviews) this is the one that most resembles what I was expecting. Its a pretty simply scent in my opinion and the patchouli is a nice, sweet, earthy smell with just a nice mellowness of musk. It most resembled what I expected a well-reviewed patchouli to smell like but, as one other person said, I didn't really think there was anything amazing about it considering its pricepoint. So, high marks for smelling nice a nice patchouli that doesn't get lost in the sandalwood or incense but not really worth the money either."", ""A word to sum up this fragrance is DRY. The patchouli is very earthy, and dusty, not wet, and the musk seems to sanitize it further. Perhaps the spices add to this as well, although it doesn't smell very spicy to me. In my humble opinion, patchouli is best when it's wetness is showcased, not wiped away, and this fragrance is simply dry and stale to me..."", 'Sweet, warm and musky and really not bad at all. I do admit this is lovely but for me it\'s rather unremarkable in that there are lots of patchouli frags on the market that are equal to or better than this example.  I love patchouli, I am a huge fan of it in fact but Etro and Serge Lutens seem to do it a little better for my taste, there\'s is slightly less sweet and a little more earthy on my skin.  Don\'t get me wrong, I like this and I know I will wear it, but I love Etro\'s Patchouly and SL\'s Borneo 1834 a bit more. UPDATE: So I have been wearing this for about 4 hours - it has good sillage and longevity (I am still in the bubble of perfume) and it\'s a grower. My initial review largely stands although, as a fan of Patchouli, this is drawing me in more and more. I think I may be drinking it by the end of the day at this rate.

This is patchouli, patchouli, patchouli from start to finish...Right at the top I also get caraway, musk and star anise very distinctively. This combination feels dry and makes the patchouli smell earthily and a little smoky. In addition, the star anise also gives PP a soft tingling sweetness and a little brightness. PP feels as if somebody has tied together a bunch patchouli leaves (with roots and earth), placed it over smoke coming from heated caraway/musk/star anise, and slapped the bundle across my face. This is natural patchouli, true to its essence. On me PP starts going skin within 2 hours (common with most LAP fragrances). The patch becomes softer, rounder and sweeter. The dry down is lovely. At this point the patch is accompanied by something sweet which I cannot identify clearly. PP is pretty much gone after 4 hours. If you like patchouli and crave for a fix of patchouli, you will like this composition. PP has a lovely, fragrant, and undisturbed patchouli scent that you will enjoy, as I do.', 'For me : This is very forest patchuli. And silimar to : Tom Ford White Patchouli.', 'THis perfumes makes me puke,waste of money', ""L'Artisan Patchouli Patch is one of the niche genre in which patchouli is used as a note in a complex blend of scents. In this case, the patchouli note is prominent but does not overwhelm the other scents. The effect emphasizes the herbal earthy smoky elements of patchouli and reduces the musty cocoa elements. This is one of the few times I have to disagree with sherapop (Fragrantica's most prolific and best reviewer in case you don't know - see her review below). Yes the patchouli is earthy, but not my image of the dirty hippy patchouli with its strong musty cocoa notes. Or maybe sherapop knew a better class of hippy than I did. In the top, sure enough there is caraway and anise, together with perhaps a minty note not listed. I have trouble picking up specifically osmanthus and iris in this rather noir scent, but I think they or their best friends are there lightening the middle a bit. The cedar is showing up in the middle too, or some dark woody note that makes the middle remind me of Pathcouli Noir (Il Profumo). There is white musk there too when you pay close attention, showing up as a clean soapy note, which is a bit strange mixed in with all the earthy wood, but if I don't try to pick the musk out it blends in surprisingly nicely. There isn't much specific to the base notes and longevity isn't great, but I like this a lot."", ""This is how patchouli SHOULD be represented in perfumery. Clean, fresh, realistic, smooth, herbal, and inviting. This fragrance isn't scary at all. It's as calming and pleasing as grandma's spice rack. It's reminiscent of fresh spearmint leaves, newspaper, and old books. Fingered pages, cracked binding, and dusty shelves. This is one of those fragrances that takes you back. Back to childhood, for me. Which is quite odd, seeing as how I never smelled patchouli for the first time until college. This is how fresh, natural, patchouli smells. It's wonderful to finally experience this in a fragrance! These days, patchouli is overexploited as a cheap way to strengthen a perfume, and it gives patchouli a bad name, because the general public is so quick to blame their distaste for strong, cheap eau's on poor patchouli, even though no one really gets to know how beautiful it can be. This is that fragrance that demonstrates what patchouli should be, how it should be used, and what it really smells like at it's best. This is herbal, minty, fresh, and slightly musty in a basement-esque mildewy sense. It's so comfortable and gorgeous, and I wouldn't mind wearing this every day for the rest of my life."", ""this is an elegant, subtle study in the component facets of patchouli, and it's successful as such. an almost indolic patchouli, rather than earthy, starts things off. it's so well-blended with white musk, woods and immortelle that the patchouli is never dominant. the drydown stars anise and this radiates nicely for hours with this most anti-hippie of patchoulis. interesting and totally wearable at all times."", 'Straight up patchouli, which dominates the whole fragrance. I picked up a bit floral from osmanthus that adds a touch of sweetness that is insufficient to combat against the earthy, inky patchouli.  You need to be a real patch lover in order to wear this, IMO.', ""I'm pretty new to this. When I smell fragrances, I tend to get pictures. With L'artisan Patchouli Patch, I see a dark smoky library or an old-fashioned gentleman's club from the 1950's. Or, a hidden room in an old majestic house or castle.

It does last a long time on my skin and depending on how many sprays, you can leave a long trail/sillage in your wake and turn off a few noses. It is a good starter for anyone trying to get into patchouli scents but not wanting the heavy/heady ones. I would not recommend for a hot summer's day as I dont see most patchouli scents as ideal for the heat anyway.you might choke someone.Fall/autumn and spring are the best seasons to rock this comfortably.

I feel like I have a mouthful of dirt after smelling this. I don't find this particulary feminine nor sexy but it is compelling, especially for patchouli lovers."", ""Get out a spade, go out into an Indonesian garden and dig up literally a patch of patchouli, complete with leaves and roots with soil still clinging along, and you will have essentially the opening of L'Artisan Parfumeur PATCHOULI PATCH. This is deep, earthy patchouli, not the chewy clean kind with the texture of watercress, but the seriously soil-covered kind. In fact, this seems pretty close to dirty hippy patchouli: lightweights had better stay away! After several minutes of this earthy stage, PATCHOULI PATCH finally evens out to a lighter patchouli drydown. But to wear the drydown, you have get through the opening, which is a true litmus test for patchouli tolerance. No real surprises here: L'Artisan Parfumeur uses literal rather than metaphorical names for most of their creations, and this one is typical: PATCHOULI PATCH you asked for, and PATCHOULI PATCH you'll get! I find this fragrance to be rather longlasting with relatively big sillage--more than expected from a niche edt."", 'Sexy on a woman. Not enough power but great ingredients and it smells natural to me. 7,5/10', ""This is the dirtiest, grittiest, most honest patchouli I've ever worn, and it expressed itself through the softest whisper. The anise and caraway contributed to the grittiness on my skin, but it stayed light and somehow fresh. I LOVED it, felt it was feminine, and had just begun to detect a whiff of iris when the fragrance disappeared completely. I think I need Patchouli Patch Extreme."", ""Softest and sweetest of patchouli. Not too earthy, though at first it's like I've just been out digging in fresh dirt! I've got Attar Bazaar's which is very resinous and crypt-like, but this one is a lot lighter. In fact, this is the patchouli note that I can smell in TM Angel! Sadly, not longlasting. PS: For another take on this one, I would not have thought it, but the man said about PP: ‚ÄúMusky and slightly powdery. Very, very nice and sexy.‚Äù Hmmmm!"", ""This is how patchouli SHOULD be represented in perfumery. Clean, fresh, realistic, smooth, herbal, and inviting. This fragrance isn't scary at all. It's as calming and pleasing as grandma's spice rack. It's reminiscent of fresh spearmint leaves, newspaper, and old books. Fingered pages, cracked binding, and dusty shelves. This is one of those fragrances that takes you back. Back to childhood, for me. Which is quite odd, seeing as how I never smelled patchouli for the first time until college. This is how fresh, natural, patchouli smells. It's wonderful to finally experience this in a fragrance! These days, patchouli is overexploited as a cheap way to strengthen a perfume, and it gives patchouli a bad name, because the general public is so quick to blame their distaste for strong, cheap eau's on poor patchouli, even though no one really gets to know how beautiful it can be. This is that fragrance that demonstrates what patchouli should be, how it should be used, and what it really smells like at it's best. This is herbal, minty, fresh, and slightly musty in a basement-esque mildewy sense. It's so comfortable and gorgeous, and I wouldn't mind wearing this every day for the rest of my life."", ""The most refined, elegant patchouli there is. Yet, at the same time it is animalic, rich and wild. I am a guy and I enjoy it tremendously. I yearn for this perfume when I don't have it on. This is a praise song to patchouli, but even though it has patchouli as the main star it is not linear at all, and has so many hidden stories. Marvelous."", ""I love this patchouli perfume! It's so real, such real honest-to-God, in your face patchouli, with all the dirt and herbaceousness, but also so beautifully sweet and soft. It's everything patchouli is, to me. I adore it! It's heavenly, and very very comforting. Deep and so extremely sensual. It's gorgeous! It's fantastic! Yum, yum. Delicious and divine. I feel so good in it. It gives me such a lift, and soothes my jangled nerves (when they need it!). It's a pure balm to my soul. And it lasts super well on me! I love it, it lasts from 5am until bedtime at 10pm (ish), and hardly weakens at all, and goes through various stages of more and less dirty, and sweet and delicate and rugged and smooth; it's so complex and interesting, and it's like going on a delicious journey through the exotic faraway lands. Goodness me I love it!  Patchouli Patch is the most perfect name for this most perfect perfume!"", 'I never thought I would become a fan of any patchouli scent. Maybe because it is most of the time paired up with sweet notes and can be quite tiring. And if someone told me my first ever Artisan Parfumeur scent would be Patchouli Patch, I would probably not believe them either. This is a very addictive and gorgeous, earthy scent. I initially got it for my sister who did not fancy it and told me to keep it. I sprayed it on my wrist and knew instantly this one is not going anywhere. It starts off with a strong patchouli note with a hint of anise seed and caraway. It stays the same throughout, sometimes emphasising more on the spicy or the woody notes. In terms of development is is quite linear, but to be honest it does not bother me that much.  It is good in terms of projection, but not overbearing or intrusive to the environment. I would say about 2-3 hours after application, this still is present on my wrist, closer to the skin.', ""This is not a patchouli for wimps! Nobody is sugar-coating it to make it more likable or popular with sweet notes of vanilla, amber, or other sticky resins. It's straight-up dry, dusty, patch. I never knew that pure patch could be so beautiful and enchanting. Makes me think of an old, majestic castle like Chambord. Very nice."", 'I am in shock, I thought I was familiar with patchouli but boy was I wrong. I understand that I have only tried refined patchouli, mixed with lovely sweet florals. This is completly different,for me this is raw, dirty in your face Patchouli so if you are not familiar with it, you should stay clear from blind buying this.  Do I like it? ask me again in a year.', ""A word to sum up this fragrance is DRY. The patchouli is very earthy, and dusty, not wet, and the musk seems to sanitize it further. Perhaps the spices add to this as well, although it doesn't smell very spicy to me. In my humble opinion, patchouli is best when it's wetness is showcased, not wiped away, and this fragrance is simply dry and stale to me..."", ""A very earthy, medicinal, honest patchouli with a strong anise streak running though it. I feel like I have a mouthful of dirt after smelling this. I don't find this particulary feminine nor sexy but it is compelling, especially for patchouli lovers."", 'A chalky patchouli, and I know this sounds crazy but I‚Äôm picking up an unsweetened cocoa note. It‚Äôs kind of difficult to describe, and judging by the list of notes I was expecting it to be smoother and creamier. Anise comes out in the dry down and takes the scent in a better direction. Still, it‚Äôs a weird one with my chemistry.', ""it's a sickly-sweet patchouli to me with a really overwhelming anise and caraway; a hard no.

Of all Etro scents, New Tradition seems the most traditional and the least \'new\'.  But the name is no accident. I think the phrase ""New Tradition"" defines the entire Etro collection. Their scents seem classic - in the sense that they don\'t pretend to be hip and trendy. But at the same time there\'s always something in this classical setup to prevent it from being boring, or mistaken for something actually old: some Dandy-ish element, some new aromachemical maybe, something in the construction that makes you sense the intention.  I think the same for Italian sartorial craftmanship: those guys know everything about blazers, shirts and trousers. They choose the best fabrics and they do it by the book, because the most important is to feel comfortable and look good in these clothes. And then there are the small elements that make that blazer look modern after all: a colorful pocket, an unusual button, a camouflage pattern, an acid-green stripe. All these details that you can creatively play with, once you\'ve mastered the craft. That combination of something familiar and something new, which is a staple in any information theory.

For those who can't divorce themselves from the association of medicine or that of the dentist chair may want to steer clear. I haven't any issue with that, and revel in the rush of such aromatics. They are all especially pleasing here with the added quenching squeeze of lime. The tobacco itself is like a dry, somewhat greenish cigar tobacco leaf, like the wafting of its aroma from an apothecary jar in a tobacconist shop. This is accompanied by a warm bay rum effect in the heart. The earthier, somewhat more animalic facets reveal themselves further into its dry down, but the effect is never smoggy or dense; it's a handsome vivaciousness. What remains in its last stages is an frankincense-cedar skin scent with whispers of spice. Cuba is simply gorgeous."", ""Sampled this at a shop hoping I would like it but I definitely didn't.

Thumbs up"", 'The top is mostly a bllast of fresh mint, supported by aromatics and a hint of sweetness (rum, supposedly?), somewhat reminding me of Lalique Ombre Noir (which also starts with a spicy mint supported by a dry myrrh). Shortly after, a mix of cloves and bay rum (aka pimento berries) kicks in giving a great impression of dry cigar tobacco leaves, quite close to MH Feuilles de Tabac, at that stage. In the base, I get mostly an animalic musk with a very subtle non-sweet honey, reminding me of SL Muscs Koublai Khan (like others have underlined before me), but also - more remotely - of Guerlain Lui (because of the cloves/musk combo and the hint of sweetness). I smelt this one in the early stages of my fragrance journey, and always desired a bottle.

It is also longer lasting and more wearable than the cologne. Right from the top, the scent comes across as quite camphorous (perhaps due to the peppermint), delicately sweetened (though nowhere near as sweet as the typical sugar-syrup designer scents of recent times) and evidently 'dirty-fresh' (that could be an effect of bergamot and the other notes). The cloves are quite prominent from quite early on, which to my nose make up the backbone of the scent. Nothing overpowering here, nor are we talking about cloves a la a 1980s dental surgery, but it provides a spicy woodiness throughout. In the heart, the cloves are joined by the bay leaf and a rose accord; this provides supporting floral-freshness rather than taking centre stage. As the scent evolves to its dry down, the woods are quite prominent, but held back by the incense which at this stage is still surprisingly camphorous, calming and meditative. The incense is hard to single-out, but it is there; just nowhere near as prominent as incense-heavy scents such as CdG, Tom Ford and Montale. This is nonetheless a positive point as the whole scent has a lot more going on. As per its name, Cuba, the scent is a celebration of the Caribbean island's heritage and culture. As a result, a tobacco note is mentioned in the literature, but this is very carefully woven in to the base. It is by no means a sickening overpowering tobacco (I'm looking at you Tom Ford!), but instead it almost plays 'hide and seek' with the incense and woods. Not necessarily a 'refreshing' scent in my books, but a long-lasting woody-spicy scent with some interesting combinations of notes. Czech & Speake, you have my attention!"", 'Review for the New EDP version Imagine making a mojito and the lime and mint are in the glass and then you spray in some John Varvatos Dark Rebel, then stick your nose in.  Fresh lime zest that‚Äôs not fading and makes your mouth water, fresh mint and fern to start, then after about 10 mins a green fresh tobacco appears with a little rum hiding in the background. The tobacco then changes towards a drier slightly bitter and smokey version with the rum moving forward and that lime still shouting. Obviously going to be long lasting. Very much like Aramis Havana, but fresher, brighter and smoother with a nice progression through the notes. Much denser than the original version of Cuba, I imagine it‚Äôll be strong enough that when you iron the top your were wearing once it‚Äôs been washed, this will make an appearance again.  Not a crowd pleaser, don‚Äôt blind buy it and it‚Äôs one you wear for yourself.  If you wore it out in a bar, I suspect they‚Äôd have a sudden unexplained rush on for mojitos as people caught a waft of you and subconsciously couldn‚Äôt get craving out of their head.', 'Wow! I gave this to my friend ages ago. I had mixed feelings about this. It was one of my learning curve buys. I writing this after using the bath oil which presents a lot smoother and softer and more of rum, bay leaf and tobacco. I re read reviews here and I‚Äôm reminded of how people‚Äôs noses work. The Yes/No about the fecal side for example - and this is what I mean about learning curve. The fecal aspect is definitely there. I smell it but you may not. My friend doesn‚Äôt and loves it. Sometimes I don‚Äôt - sometimes I just break down the notes and I love it. I also get some people‚Äôs comments about urinals - yeah - I get that too - quite common and understandable as the boozy rum and oily green ingredients and lime will actually smell close to this naturally. I also get the Coca Cola comments. People are also wired differently both in their senses and how their brain works. Now I have over 400 perfumes (a lot more since I bought this - it was a blind buy as I love tobacco) I find I can tolerate some of the more ‚Äòdemanding‚Äô perfumes but I‚Äôve managed to maintain perspective and call a spade a spade. I think that as your nose experiences more, it becomes more ‚Äòtolerant‚Äô and hence I‚Äôve become melancholic as I miss this scent. The reality is this is a scent I like but wouldn‚Äôt wear In public as I know some people will think - ahem - poorly of it and quite frankly they‚Äôd be quite rightly entitled to that opinion. Sample first or even two times.

It doesn't have the longevity or complexity of Potion, it doesn't have the inexpensive hit of rum and cloves found in the Pinaud bottle, but it's a fine fragrance none the less. The opening is all about the bergamot lime and rum, pure sweet freshness. Then the cloves and bay leaf come through. A beautiful warm spiciness held together by a something I can't place. I know that something is the mint but it's not a regular peppermint, so I'm not smelling it as such. It's definitely got the warm coca cola vibe. Over the next couple of hours the warm smell softens a little more with a light floral tobacco and the unmistakeable amber tonka bean scent. The frankincense and woody cedar stops it from becoming too soft and keeps a light sharpness. Longevity is only moderate. After 4 or 5 hours it's pretty much faded away. Sillage is moderate with a small amount on the neck.

For me other than 88 this is one of the best from Czech and Speake. A bit pricey but really fantastic scent for me."", 'Sweet bay rum that feels as old as the bartender who should be wearing it, after a messy night and waking up face down in a dumpster', ""Czech & Speake's Cuba is the sort of scent that you are never going to get again if the current tides of civilisation and progress (read: mass culture) persist. Here is a proper 'cologne'. I refrain from using the word 'perfume' as it is quite explicit who the target audience is; and, women, if they wear this, they'd perhaps be the ones who prefer colognes over perfumes. Here is a cologne done in the best traditions of the old school, but with some nuances and flourishes that render a suave, fresh appeal rather than something dusty or dated.  Cuba is a simple yet complex affair; beginning with a burst of lime and mint paired with a note of rum. The mint is underplayed and expertly handled so that the concoction smells closer to an abstract cocktail, rather than any toothpaste association. That isn't all; there is a deft touch of clove, and a very prominent note of bay. The aromatics are further shaped by a rapidly developing warm, humid note of tobacco that hints at leafy cigars, together with cedar and vetiver. I don't really get any incense from it, and it smells perfect. The development is brisk, then slowed out as the fresh-aromatic nature encounters a plot twist to reveal a warm, glowing scent. I'm not surprised that warm weather brings out the best in this scent. Luckily I don't get any note of faeces, but then, I never really had a way of life compliant with contemporary North American (specifically: Toronto) standards of sterilisation and sanitisation. Cuba exhibits discreet to average projection and moderate longevity based on an abundant application. Note that the 'cologne' strength is relevant, don't expect a powerhouse. Cuba is far removed from contemporary perfume trends in 2019, and I'm thankful for that. It's 'niche' at designer prices, at least when I bought it a couple of years back; more importantly, its style is very different. There is minimal emphasis on synthetics though I'm sure it employs quite a bit, and it reminds me of the earlier/vintage Creeds like Baie de Genievre. Cuba exhibits excellent separation of notes, is airy, and lingers on in memory space for long after it fades away from skin.  If you're curious about how it relates Havana, they are largely different scents with Cuba being fresh-spicy, whereas Havana is warm-spicy; however, there is an uncanny link in the 'personalities' of the two scents, somehow they feel connected, even after accounting for the tobacco and bay/rum notes. They sort of go hand in hand, and I can say this about both: here there is style, here there is substance. This is a scent for discerning gents who understand and value respect and appreciation; wet shavers, hat wearers, and tango dancers.  4/5 (positive) Note: Review is of the EdT. I just realised I have never tried the aftershave, and now I feel stupid."", ""Interesting. Took me two months to get used to it - at first I thought it was a horrible blind buy (I also bought the bath oil). But the bath oil had a more pleasant presentation and so I kept coming back to the bottle. AT first it had a somewhat urinic or stale sweaty presentation but I grew to ignore that and embrace the dusty lemon spice and tobacco. I find the note table here skewed wrong and comments about the strength of the mint exagerrated. To me I would describe it as a damp tea bag with lemon and a light tobacco top note. The clove, bay leaf and grass giving the body under the citrus and the Rose, Vetiver and Mint and tobacco polishing it off and giving it an old school feel somewhat ala Guerlain Habit Rouge, Eau Sauvage (it could even pass as a flanker to ES) and Floris 89 etc. Now when I wear it (mostly as a personal scent at home in the evenings) I find it pleasant to put nose to skin and pull apart the pleasant ingredients.

I am also surprised to see remarks about a supposed ""fecal note"" being brandished about in the reviews - my nose picks up nothing of the sort. This fragrance reads both very green and dark, musty brown to my nose, dry tobacco and something rather camphor-like; somewhat similar to Maison Incens Tabac Licorii but the latter is saltier and less complex. I can detect every single listed note in this composition if I choose to focus on them independently, which is oddly satisfying. Having never visited Cuba, smelling this fragrance does evoke what I imagine Old Havana to be like - walking along narrow streets after dark, the rhythms of timba musicians and inviting golden lights luring you into a small pub where a giant fan is set to max speed but you would never know it existed unless you saw it, the stifling air inside being offset by natives in good spirits, sipping on rum, smoking cigars, playing chess. A caramel-skinned woman with red lips and black eyes is dancing with her partner for the evening in the middle of the room, her flowy dress and black curls creating a pleasant movement of air in your direction in the packed locale. Out of the two of them, I feel like the gentleman would certainly be the one wearing this perfume, not her. As a woman, I could see myself wearing it, but as a very Finnish person living in The Netherlands it feels like it would be false advertising for me to wear it.', 'An opening of... Hamster bedding? Which quickly fades into a mojito, and then a burst of rich, pungent tobacco and then... Gone, with a trace of musk. All in 30 minutes. What a disappointment. I love when a perfume develops so drastically, but not so quickly!', ""Okay so... 'Horrendous but interesting' is my appraisal. Despite wanting to try these C&S fragrances for ages now and without prior knowledge of this ones notes or reading anything about it, I'd assumed with a name like 'Cuba' it would be all about Tobacco...perhaps coffee too? but definitely some warm juice. I was correct in my assumption and like the true perfume lover I am, I except that certain unpleasant notes may be intrinsic in making a masterful composition. I scanned over the reviews here and only had to venture a couple down to see the dreaded 'F' word! Yes I too get the fecal in this and it taints my appreciation of what starts out pretty bad but in a different way. The opening is sickening boozy almost like the breath of drunk but a drunk who's trying to cover it up with mints! A twist of lime in there kinda works with the rum and mint but also makes this even louder and more odd. Really the minty accord is menthol like and adds such a strange dimension because you can tell there's going to be a strong tobacco about to develop. There's a spicy blend of bay leaf and clove in here which is not helping Cuba's cause either. When it does develop things get more intriguing still and there it is the pleasing, slightly dirty but accurate tobacco...that is for a second then...Feces! It's almost to the point you move your head away in disgust but if applied to your neck or chest not a lot you can do! Then minty tobacco comes back (which isn't even nice)...and you give it another chance then...fecal mote again. I smoke cigars on rare occasions and when choosing a particularly full bodied Cubanos they do indeed have a slightly unpleasant note to them, like an earthy manure type smell...maybe this is what C&S have tried to capture? Instead of fresh dried, countryside cowpat I get synthetic stink bomb, a smell which exceeds rather than emulates nature.  I'm not a fan of C&S Cuba...whoever likes this or wants to acquire the taste good luck to you! Or if you're among the people who don't know what others are talking about when then describe this awful note...It must be great for you having a fragrance you enjoy and frustrating that people berate it to the point of smelling like shit...it must seem harsh.  I'm truly sorry to be one of the detractors because these are affordable and very different, quality niche fragrances from a Uk based company but I can't abide Cuba. The drydown is much better in fairness but it's only after several hours the nastiness goes and then it's a barely recognizable warm skin scent. Lasts pretty well and as I mentioned isn't bad in the end but not for me at all, it was certainly an experience."", ""On the faecal note: An insight that I'd like to offer is this: A few years ago I got my hands on a Cuban cigar. I smelt it...expecting a delightful scent...and I recoiled; I was convinced it smell like faeces. Through and through - a quality Cuban. Smelt like s***. I was shocked and disappointed. A year on from that, I smell the same cigar, and the smell is different, appealing and not revolting.  Cuba, for me seemed to capture elements of this pleasant cigar smell. I think the fact that others mention a faecal note is perhaps only a testament to achieving the scent's aims. To smell reminiscent of cigars. Perhaps those who cannot appreciate it, simply haven't developed their noses in that direction. It's an acquired taste.  Personally, from my samples, I'd love to have this fragrance."", ""ive always wanted to have a perfume that reminds me of mafia, the cigarettes, cigars, smoke, something with leather and suits, something very masculine. so this came up in one of the best perfume shops in the town where i live. at start i LOVED the bottle color and name. when i sprayed some on my skin it smelled TOO RISKY & STRONG (the 2 main things i admire) but the kind of smell wasn't sure, i mean i said ok i'll leave it for awhile.... and after few minutes the smell turned upside down, oh MY... it smelled EXACTLY like a public restroom (bathroom) in a wide touristic cheap bazaar. i almost threw up. i gave it a try for the second time as i know that my skin chemical is rare and nothing works fine easily (like mona di orio cuir smells like fresh blood after 3 minutes on my skin) so i sprayed Cuba again but now on my clothes, after a while it turned to be the same a public restroom in a cheap bazaar. so i gave it up but honestly i would LOVE to have a cuba mafia perfume but absolutely not this one for sure. to me it's not a good one, sorry (Edit - 29-04-2014): the third time, tested it, i really liked it! it has an extreme rum and incense smell, truly it is a mafia like smell. i guess my nose has changed since sniffing brand new notes i never smelled before in other perfumes. this perfume is going to my collections yes."", 'At first it seemed scary, I thought this drug is, after a while I began to feel the development of the fragrance in a light spicy sweetness of the clove, and the beauty of rum and tobacco. Great Combination. So I would rate it: Smell: 9/10 Projection: 8/10 Longevity: 7/10', 'There is no fecal note! Only Cohiba Behike in humidor (spanish cedar wood) + mojito. Masterpiece.', 'Fecal note was probably on purpose since it was inspired by his trip to Cuba.', 'boozy with rum and tobacco, light in sillage, charming but rather linear!', ""For me, it smells like a Mojito VERY briefly, and then settles down to an anamalistic musk, very reminiscent of Lutens' Muscs Koublai Khan. Out of the middle notes, the only one I really get is clove."", ""Like I've said before, this smells like a cigar plucked from a dead man's butt..."", ""I come close to liking this, I guess particularly the tobacco and the rum, but there's something in it that strikes me as unpleasant. Perhaps the cloves."", 'I think this fragrance is really nice. I do not get the fecal note people are talking about! lol I guess it comes to the surface on different skin. Its not 88 but I do enjoy it.', 'Minty-bay rum. Cuba opens with a blast of aromatic and refreshing notes of mint, lime and bay-rum. The overall acidic and sort of balsamic effect brings to mind of Piper Nigrum and other Tiger Balm-inspired composition such as Esprit Du Tigre but where these two stay pretty linear in reproducing this effect, Cuba is joined in the middle phase by an animalic musky/rose accord that winks at classic perfumery. Simply amazing and original. The drydown is more conventonally classic with the appearance of a woody-tobacco combo that drives the fragrance towards the barbershop type of stuff. Nice concept - Well executed. Rating: 7-7.5/10', 'Above all is a minted-tobacco fragrance; at the start i detect mint, lime(not always); then sometimes i detect cloves(not always), sometimes franckincense and patchouli, and a rum ""barrique""(woody); no sweetness, only dryness; is not a vintage fragrance. It doesn\'t last, is a eau de cologne, and this is the only flaw; is a fall/winter fragrance, not for the younger people. PS: i wear it today, but i felt a sense of ""retr√≤"" scent, very \'60.....perhaps the tabac is a note very classic, but in a ""older"" and ""vintage"" way; however it\'s a scent very classy and elegant.', ""Hmm...I don't know really where should I start my rewiew...I'm totally shocked and impressed at the same time. It's beginning with a harsh bergamott screaming and as Doc Elly felt that fecal note, I could detect it too...unfortunately...:(I can't detect the basil and rum note.  After the shocking, rank, sour fecal horror is faded away and turned into a woody, warm pleasant smell. So...I have mixed feelings about this scent, I'm not sure I want to wear this..."", 'What a controversial fragrance. So many complain of getting a fecal note off the top, and some claim this note pervades the scent\'s entire evolution. Then there are those who feel this note is not part of Cuba, and find the scent to be nice but nothing remarkable. I\'m in the latter camp.  Cuba does have very dark, earthy, somewhat indolic elements to its construct, but beyond the density of cigar tobacco and rum, I don\'t get the fecal animalic presence at all. However, this definitely doesn\'t smell clean or ""fresh"" by any measure. The mint does enliven things, and there\'s a healthy dose of cedar underpinning the scent. But nowhere does it enter a realm of brightness. Note separation is beautiful, and the ingredients are clearly top notch. But all things considered, I really don\'t get anything more than a dandified bay rum out of Cuba. It does have bay leaf and rum notes, so why this gets its premium niche billing is beyond me. If you\'re a huge fan of bay rum and want something to go with your aftershave, Cuba is something you should sniff. For the rest of us, I say pass.', ""A woody mint in the top and I smell something else. Like tabacco from a cigar. no rum for me. And I cant smell any bergamot and lime either. it dry's down to a nice woody scent with wiffs of mint.I find it a very masculine scent but I guess a strong woman could wear it to"", 'I needed to go out to my office this afternoon, so applied Cuba without reading any reviews of it (I never like to read any reviews or notes before testing) thinking it would be a nice, public-friendly scent. I‚Äôm now running around in circles hitting my head with my palm, wondering what on earth I was thinking.  Cuba starts out with an astonishingly strong and unmistakable fecal note. Not your normal indole, not civet, but feces pure and simple. Huh? Is this supposed to evoke an open sewer festering in the hot sun? I suppose there are some in Cuba, but surely there are better things to put in a perfume that‚Äôs supposed to represent that country. There are also spices and florals; maybe there‚Äôs even the de rigeur tobacco and rum and lime and vanilla somewhere in there, but they‚Äôre so dirtied up in the muck that it‚Äôs impossible for me to find and enjoy them, and I certainly wouldn‚Äôt want to subject others to this fiasco. I am flabbergasted by all of the good reviews that this scent has gathered. Are there really people out there who are anosmic to the fecal note? Do people ignore it because they think they ought to like it? What‚Äôs up, anyway?  I tried to give Cuba ample benefit of the doubt, letting it dry down, hoping the feces would go away, trying to find all of the good things that others say are in there, but the fecal note was always lurking in the background if not parading in the foreground. I eventually had to scrub with soap and water, followed by alcohol and acetone to get rid of it. I don‚Äôt very often find a perfume that‚Äôs so repulsive to me that I have to scrub, and I don‚Äôt give many unequivocally negative reviews, but this is one.

Because really, the list of ingredients sound so yummy, how can the result be so off-puting? I think it's the clove that's ruining it for me, one of my least favorite notes. But the mint's prominent too, as is the cedar. There is no tonka bean I can detect and I was looking forward to its smoothness. In the end, all I can smell on my skin, and a friend's who tried it with me, is a really bad body odor. I love spicy scents, but I can't pull that off.  The more is dries down, the less prominent the spices are and that somehow makes it better; more intriguing and sparkling than the initially cloying smell I got from it. Still, this is not a perfume I'm willing to go near again. Even my sample will probably go unfinished.

Soon a bit of green from petitgrain or some other citrus leaf/twig. In the drydown, there is a ghost of the lemon and petitgrain held up by a simple sweet amber and what seems like a bit of musk.

Anbar is very similar to citricco but alot less citrus. vettiveru imo is the best out of the 3. also i usually got 5-6 sprays with these types of scents to give me a light 6-8 hours']"

I was expecting something harsh maybe, but boy was I wrong. It opened with no green notes at all to me. It went right through to the tonakbeans, vanilla, woodsy notes and spices. My first thought was chocolate, but since chocolate not is listed as a note, I guess it is the vanilla-tonkabean I detect as chocolate. The drydown on me is soapy warm with a hint of liquorice as well a a very soft musc. A luxurious sweet scent. Not much unisex. I think this is a very feminine scent, but I like feminine scents on my man - so why not:) Sillage is moderate and longevity is less than moderate on my skin.

It softens virtually immediately into effortless, kindly, earthy sweetness, watery vanilla (could it be? :-)), woody/green, a tiny bit aromatic notes and almost soapy cleanliness... I have applied this sample before reading the notes and reviews and trying to figure out what is this scent made of, I could not pick any particular note, but something in this potion almost touched my heart :-), a distant memory perhaps...but I still can\'t point out what it is... Something in this makes me feel nostalgic and child-like happy... The sweetness in Paname is raw, rooty, almost organic and gentle and reminds me quite a bit of Sugarwood by Costamor. On me it is truly feminine and yet - there is this deliciously sweet masculine hint, I can\'t quite explain it, as I don\'t generally find ""masculine notes"" sweet in other fragrances, but this is how I feel with this one. Wearing this on a pleasant sunny morning, I was thinking that this must be very weather-versatile :-). Sort of mood brightening on any occasion I would say.  Lovely fragrance, but doesn\'t last on me!', ""The opening of Keiko Mecheri PANAME seemed a bit sugary and suggested that this might be a vanilla oriental woody perfume intended for women. However, within about a minute the absinthe appears most prominently to aromaticize the composition, turning this into a somewhat less but still fairly feminine scent. I'd say that this closer to Bvlgari JASMIN NOIR than ABSOLUMENT ABSINTHE, probably because of the tonka/vanilla which makes the wormwood smell more like black licorice than the woody absinthe of the more masculine absinthe perfumes I've tried. PANAME smells delightful, but unfortunately the longevity is not that good, so for now I'll continue to reach for JASMIN NOIR for my black licorice fix. Oriental lovers with a sweetish licorice bent would surely like this creation, which is not nearly so sweet as LOLITA LEMPICKA but definitely sweeter than I've come to expect from fragrances marketed as unisex."", 'Looking at the notes, this sounded bold and brooding, but I forgot to factor in KM\'s heavy censorship of sillage, which instead makes this composition rather mysterious at best. The green top notes are detectable only for the split second when you first open the bottle (or maybe I imagined them!). On my skin, the dark and oh-so-smooth ""absinthe"" note immediately dominates - which, in this case, translates into a bittersweet combination of anise and licorice, unlike the hoard of absinthe-wannabes out there that smell like herbal tea. (Yes, I\'m thinking of you too, Absolument Absinthe!) After that seductive but restrained burst of darkness, which demands only the best whiskey and a cigar, but not necessarily a man to enjoy them, I cannot help but feel let down by what follows. For one, there is barely anything left to smell after an hour or so. And what remains stabs the dark opening in the back and sweetens considerably, with the woods, which you\'d expect to provide the backbone of this fragrance, crumbling into nothingness. The precise composition of what\'s left is hard to untangle - a combination of the scent\'s short leash but also (let\'s give credit to KM!) of it being well-blended - but the overall impression is of high quality spiced brown sugar. Not enough for my cup of tea, but that won\'t stop me from enjoying the hour of darkness in the few drops I have left.', ""The opening of Keiko Mecheri PANAME seemed a bit sugary and suggested that this might be a vanilla oriental woody perfume intended for women.

I\'d also say it is on the feminine side of things, but not too far. However, it\'s reasonably natural smelling and I could see how many would enjoy it during the spring.

Have given it a few wearings from a decant, I have to say that if you‚Äôre looking for sunny and uplifting, this isn‚Äôt it. In fact, the word that comes to mind is melancholic. I can imagine a small seaside pensione in a picturesque town on the Italian Riviera. It‚Äôs nearing the end of tourist season and most of the visitors have left. The middle-aged owner/manager sips a drink at his near-empty bar, reflecting on the end of another summer that that he made good money, hosted and met guests from around the world, and maybe had a romantic liaison with an American or UK lady on vacation. Still, he feels a certain unhappiness within. Is it his increasing sense of mortality? An impending loneliness as the town empties out for several months? I‚Äôm not sure, but I bet he‚Äôs wearing Costa Mediterranea. The scent itself is a dry, dusty citrus that doesn‚Äôt really evolve from initial spray. Somewhat aromatic but very subdued, even contemplative. Sillage and projection are virtually non-existent on me. There is definitely a marine note that lingers a bit before it all falls apart. Reading the marketing copy on this one, I‚Äôm just not feeling the ‚Äúdazzling holiday on the sea‚Äù theme. I‚Äôll stick with more bergamot-neroli-lemon-herbal oriented offerings to get my Mediterranean fix.', ""Even though this citrus forward scent was launched in 2002, it does not smell dated. It's a great Mediterranean medley of tangy fruits and herbal aromatics. There's nothing artificial here in this refreshing blend. Leans a little bit masculine but not overtly so, it's perfectly unisex.  I think Costa Mediterranea could become my signature summer scent. One of my next full bottle purchases. This is an enthusiastic thumbs up!"", ""Acqua di Gio has long been my favorite male fragrance. I tried to wear it myself, but it was just a bit too manly for me. At last I have found something that is like Acqua di Gio for my chemistry. It's not nearly so melony, but it has a nice, fresh, seaside vibe. The citrus I get is not nearly as strong as others, and it's more of a mix of sweet orange and grapefruit. I also get strong herbal notes, can't say rosemary for certain, but it's very dominant in the first hour. It's so well-blended and smooth and fresh, with a masculine edge that's not too much for me. Wonderful in warm weather. Seems clearly made for warm nights in Italy."", 'Costa Mediterranea is a burst of citrus, especially bergamot.

I'm an older university student, so this scent struck a delightful and elegant contrast to the lightweight fruity florals the other women were wearing at school. That said, I think I'll gift Le Boyfriend with this sample and enjoy smelling it on him. This fragrance boasts a nicely sustained citrus that is delicious to smell, and the dry-down is a warmly burnished vetiver that I find delightful in the extreme. Very nicely balanced. Skews more masculine to my nose with its classic air, but could be a fit for the right lady. Beautiful, in any case."", ""Holy Neroli!!!

I do not like any tinsel (my hand more often reaches for simple, laconic bottles), I am very cautious about musk, fruity notes rather repel me, but in these fragrances there is some magical alchemy that captivates me.', 'Such a beautiful bottle as on the picture - 100 ml. The bottle with a rectangular elongated bottle is more modest - 30 ml, in a dark green box without a picture. And there and there - the consultant said - thin plates of gold, which gradually dissolve in the liquid as the perfume is used, shimmering on the skin with golden sparkles when applied. The fragrance itself at the beginning seemed more interesting than its brethren - cold spices with fruits, raspberry is heard, flowers and sandalwood. In the middle the fruits-flowers left, vanilla appeared, spices became heavier. The base is quite evening, even night - saturated and dense. At all this persistence is average. Not for every day, it is tiring.']"

(it's rare that I say that)"", 'NOT a safe blind buy.  NOT a ""hidden gem"". If you are looking for a sandalwood fragrance, look elsewhere and keep looking. Reason I say this is to prevent anyone else from making the same horrible mistake I made in blind buying this monstrosity expecting a sandalwood fragrance.  Don\'t do it!  Byblos was a Milan design collective featuring various young designers, named after an iconic hotel in Saint Tropez.  Big in the 1970s.  The young Gianni Versace collaborated with Byblos (before he was famous).  I remember Byblos mainly because they used to make awesome sunglasses. The same cannot be said for their fragrances. Some years ago in Italy I found (and stupidly blind bought) both the EDT and the now-discontinued EDP of Byblos Sandalo. Both are disappointing, except in the EDP the disappointment is more intense. Byblos Sandalo is a screechingly artificial, floral-soapy atrocity originally designed for women and utterly devoid of anything resembling sandalwood Sandalwood is my obsession - a raw material I know intimately in all its incarnations: the four sandalwood varieties native to India, the seven native to Australia, and the three Pacifiic island varieties - including Santalum Album, Spicatum, Austrocaledonicum, Paniculatum, Lanceolatum, Acuminatum, Malayagiri, Laoshan, Red, Black, so-called ""West Indies sandalwood"" (Amyris) - and this bizarre concoction from Byblos does not smell like any of them.  If it was meant to be an accord it fails miserably. More like a practical joke.  Sandalo was originally one of a series of linear, single note dominant fragrances for women, released by Byblos as both an EDP and EDT as a ‚Äúfragrance palette‚Äù to be mixed and layered with each other √† la Tom Ford, the EDPs in a squat, cylindrical bottle, the EDTs in the same bottle as pictured above. The other fragrances in the series seem to have been long discontinued and I forget what they all were now, but there was Rose, Musk and Amber and they each had a different coloured flacon. Byblos Sandalo is unspeakably, offensively, awful: a sweet, floral, soapy abomination that simply does NOT smell like any sandalwood that exists in the real world.  Nor does it smell like any half-decent synthetic sandalwood either: it quite obviously does not contain Javanol, aka ""Molecule 04"", one of the most expensive sandalwood-esque aroma chemicals, nor does it contain Bacdanol, Firsantol, Polysantol, Brahmanol, Ebanol, Hindinol or any of their contemporaries however it might possibly contain one of the extremely cheap, prehistoric, synthetic sandalwoods like Indisan, Sandalore or Sandela. To be honest, I can‚Äôt imagine anyone wearing this by choice and suspect the only reason it‚Äôs still around is because suckers (like me) looking for a sandalwood fragrance mistakenly buy it. Caveat emptor Really don\'t understand the reviews full of hyperbolic praise for this crap. Byblos Sandalo is cheap and nasty - and smells cheap and nasty. To be brutally honest, anyone who thinks this abomination smells like sandalwood clearly has no idea what sandalwood is. Taste may be subjective but reality is not. Don\'t waste your money on this garbage. Even free it would be a ripoff.  If you‚Äôre looking for a real sandalwood fragrance, do yourself a favour and get LORENZO VILLORESI SANDALO instead.  [For a modestly priced sandalwood try Korloff Rouge Santal, Floris Santal or Pal Zileri Sartoriale]', ""I kinda like this, but to me, it smells like 80% javanol @ about 5%, with just a touch of patchouli and amber -- maybe a bit of rose if I strain the nose a bit. Not a fresh or woody kind of sandalwood, but more of a synthetic molecule type. But where straight javanol can get a bit mildewy and stodgy (at least to my nose), this does have an almost honey-like undercurrent that redeems it into something either a man or woman could pull off. Dry down lightens into something a bit reminiscent of a slightly more adult Johnson's baby shampoo vibe -- which is to say clean and light for a wood-centric scent, and pleasant if not terribly serious. Expect performance more on par with a top-heavy summer scent -- lightweight, staying well within arm's length and lingering for a 3-4 hours as a skin scent. Good, not great, but a fantastic value considering the pittance for which it can be had."", 'Unisex scent. Simple sandalwood...citrus..light rose-y...woody. Nice spring/summer scent...for me. Does not go ""barber-shoppy"" on me...thank God...lol. Mild sillage/longevity....but still very worth the low price point. I like,I like !!!', ""First of all, it's a unisex scent.  It can be worn by women and men and by all ages.  Then, it's a flat and linear fragrance.  I don't smell anything else appart from a dry and subtle note of sandalwood. Not the one of Body shop for example, that one is a definite male scent.  This one is bitter and very very natural, not at all feminine, but not at all annoying. When you wear it is like wearing on you a small forest of sandalwood trees that were naturaly destiled and their scent wasn't artificially intensified with other additives. It lasts very long, without occupying the whole place you are in.  I couldn't say I am mad about it, I think it's hard for anyone to get mad about this kind of perfumes...unless you like NATURAL scents.  I wear it because it gives a certain 'gravity' that sometimes is needed in my job. It's also very good for layering, one can put on another more floral perfume later, the two of them will blend to a wonderful and unusual scent.  It's interesting that its subtleness makes it easily wearable by a woman."", ""First of all, it's a unisex scent.  It can be worn by women and men and by all ages.

If you are looking for a sandalwood fragrance, look elsewhere and keep looking. Reason I say this is to prevent anyone else from making the same horrible mistake I made in blind buying this monstrosity expecting a sandalwood fragrance.  Don\'t do it!  Byblos was a Milan design collective featuring various young designers, named after an iconic hotel in Saint Tropez.  Big in the 1970s.  The young Gianni Versace collaborated with Byblos (before he was famous).  I remember Byblos mainly because they used to make awesome sunglasses. The same cannot be said for their fragrances. Some years ago in Italy I found (and stupidly blind bought) both the EDT and the now-discontinued EDP of Byblos Sandalo. Both are disappointing, except in the EDP the disappointment is more intense. Byblos Sandalo is a screechingly artificial, floral-soapy atrocity originally designed for women and utterly devoid of anything resembling sandalwood Sandalwood is my obsession - a raw material I know intimately in all its incarnations: the four sandalwood varieties native to India, the seven native to Australia, and the three Pacifiic island varieties - including Santalum Album, Spicatum, Austrocaledonicum, Paniculatum, Lanceolatum, Acuminatum, Malayagiri, Laoshan, Red, Black, so-called ""West Indies sandalwood"" (Amyris) - and this bizarre concoction from Byblos does not smell like any of them.  If it was meant to be an accord it fails miserably. More like a practical joke.  Sandalo was originally one of a series of linear, single note dominant fragrances for women, released by Byblos as both an EDP and EDT as a ‚Äúfragrance palette‚Äù to be mixed and layered with each other √† la Tom Ford, the EDPs in a squat, cylindrical bottle, the EDTs in the same bottle as pictured above. The other fragrances in the series seem to have been long discontinued and I forget what they all were now, but there was Rose, Musk and Amber and they each had a different coloured flacon. Byblos Sandalo is unspeakably, offensively, awful: a sweet, floral, soapy abomination that simply does NOT smell like any sandalwood that exists in the real world.  Nor does it smell like any half-decent synthetic sandalwood either: it quite obviously does not contain Javanol, aka ""Molecule 04"", one of the most expensive sandalwood-esque aroma chemicals, nor does it contain Bacdanol, Firsantol, Polysantol, Brahmanol, Ebanol, Hindinol or any of their contemporaries however it might possibly contain one of the extremely cheap, prehistoric, synthetic sandalwoods like Indisan, Sandalore or Sandela.

Definitely not a safe blind buy. I actually feel sick smelling this - it smells dusty, musty and feels suffocating. Maybe it is the patchouli but I genuinely feel like I can‚Äôt catch a breath.  I am obsessed with the idea - it is definitely an evocative scent‚Ä¶ wearable though?‚Ä¶ not for me üíî', 'It is definitely an unusual fragrance. A hyperrealistic sweet incense ""walking inside a catholic church"" scent. Love the idea but unfortunately feel suffocated by it. Made me willing to try others in the series though.', ""Cannot believe how overhyped this one is. This is one of the few I have actually scrubbed off. Maybe it would have improved but I honestly couldn't get past the opening. It has a sickly sweet aroma off the top. Everyone was saying church incense, so that's what I was expecting, but it just didn't come through for me."", ""Just got this in. I get a very strong fizzy sweet ginger ale smell from this. Like a Canada Dry, not a Schwepp's. It's kind of all I'm getting. It's not unpleasant, just not what I was expecting. Fresh and cool and effervescent rather than damp and gothic and churchy. Hmmn. Curious."", 'If you\'re at all familiar with the actual resins and woods that constitute incense, you will smell that this is totally a frankincense scent. Whatever the ""incense"" note means to you, it is not a generically ""smoky"" potpourri. It\'s almost like how clementine, orange, sweet candy lemon and fresh sour lemon can all be gathered under a ""citrus"" note. Not trying to seem smart, it\'s just that incense could be anything from a general smokey note like cigarette, a fireplace, coal, or be more cool, more warm and sweet, or like any scented incense sticks. This is frankincense without being smoked. If you run a bit of the resin on your hand to warm it up you sense this subtle almost sweetly minty smell. No smoke in this perfume. It starts like a light and fizzy raw frankincense with maybe a bit of cool myrrh, almost imagine a carbonated sweet 7up, dries down warmer a bit pissy and intimate and softly herbal like sweet chamomile tea.  Yes it\'s reminiscent of church but the raw incense. Not when it\'s burnt. Cool scent, I don\'t see any resemblance to Liturgie heures, that one is dominantly woody, though also cool.  I like this the same way I like frankincense in general. Non offensive but not generic at all.', 'My Modus Operandi is rather unusual when it comes to sampling new fragrances. In every batch of samples that i acquire, obviously there are some fragrances im more interested in then the others. I always leave the ones im most curious about last, with the final one being the most ‚Äúimportant‚Äù to me. Because of this, sometimes i end up setting them aside for weeks or even months. A sort of self-hyping aswell as delayed gratification.  Being drawn to church related art aswell as incense scents, Commes de Garcon‚Äôs Avignon was on my ‚ÄúTry list‚Äù for a long time and i had the sample set aside for nearly 2 months now, its the very last one out of the bunch. At one point i realised that incense and olibanum (frankincense) isn‚Äôt exactly the same thing, not always atleast. Incense is a broader term, its an accord that can be done in many ways just like musk or citruses can be. It can be ambery, ashy, smokey, woody, etc. I prefer the scent of olibanum with its dusty, sticky resinous facets and thats exactly what we get in Avignon.  Avignon didn‚Äôt dissapoint in its realistic, authentic use of olibanum. Its a fragrance that provides great fidelity to the artistic direction, and thats where the story takes a twist i didn‚Äôt expect. I always thought that the more realistic the olibanum is, the more i would love it and Avignon prooved that wrong. The fragrance isn‚Äôt thin by any means, Its just too...raw...too naked to me. It starts off light but as soon as it moves into the mid and drydown it blooms into unadultered, dry and dusty olibanum. Its the scent of the unlit resins themselfs, just concentrated. It smells almost ‚Äústale‚Äù, the same way old church pews smell like. If frankincense was a flower, this fragrance would be a soliflore and if it was food, it would be a gourmand. When it comes to olibanum based perfumes, my mind keeps wandering back to Armani Prive Sable Nuit which captured my heart. Sable Nuit is more dressed up and its softened by vanilla, cedar and benzoin. Its a more subtle olibanum fragrance that still emphasizes the note, yet manages to create a calming, meditative and more complex scent. The only problem is that its alot more expensive then Avignon and equally hard to find in my country.  Avignon also made me understand Filippo Sorcinelli‚Äôs Reliqvia better, see the olibanum more clearly in that composition. It turned out to be an educational scent and im thankfull for the opportunity to experience it because it will be a reference perfume for me from now on. If you are looking for a definitive church resin perfume then you are in the right place.', 'Devout, slightly pissy cathedral resins. Bone dry incense. Gets oddly animalic in the summertime? The midday bells are ringing. A draft flows in through that there cross of the confessional screen...', 'At first I really disliked this and thought it smelled of a very particular character. That was until the smoky chamomile tea scent came through and saved it.', ""Invigoratingly cool stone walls of a medieval catholic church on a hot summer's day, the incense has infused into the tapestries over the centuries. A new stick is lit and the smoke swirls towards the heavens, mesmerizing against the beam of light from the rose windows. Somewhere outside, yellow flowers bloom.  This is absolutely beautiful, intimate and inviting you to meditation, to slow down and just be for a while. I pined after this for years and finally bought it blindly, and I was not disappointed. It's a cold incense, sort of dry, meditative. There's not sweetness so do not expect that. Also no patchouli, thankfully."", 'I had Avignon all wrong. Having read descriptions of a ""gothic, churchy"" incense, I was surprised by the lack of smoke and how strongly the resins and yellow florals make themselves known. This is a measured, studied incense. It took a theology class too young. I can\'t smell the patchouli without potentially making shit up, but I can detect earthy base notes which soften and contextualize the three wise men of it all. Development over time is beautiful. Also, the atomizers for the incense series are really good. Don\'t buy decants of these, just lowball people on Mercari until you hit the jackpot.', 'Pretty awesome. Opens as if its a cedar frag. A sharp cedar, almost lemony tart. Oakmoss and patchouli are very forward on the open as well. Very fresh and airy opening while being weighty(its always the contrast that we appreciate in art). After about 15mins, you really start to smell the incense. This is 100% Catholic church incense. Transports you to Mass. But still a light and airy perfumey way. The myrrh and frankincense smell real.  Anyhow - its amazing. Smells awesome and worth its 4.3+ rating. The only drawback is the performance. Its important to note--- This thing is beast-mode for longevity on SKIN. Normally, things last long on clothes and not so much on skin for me. But this was detectable on my hand after 13 hrs. Sillage/Projection are a different story. Both are extremely poor. It doesnt last long on clothes either. Despite the mixed performance -- its a 9.5/10. Just bring a decant and spray an ml every 2 hrs.', ""love love love it. but she is not for everyone! i grew up catholic, attended mass every friday. smells exactly like mass- it's amazing. my only complaint is how intimate the sillage is; but maybe that's a good thing bc im seeing some of yall hate this. tbh, id be an absolute menace if the sillage was heavier. avignon will definitely be in my personal rotation."", ""This scent brings back a recollection of Sunday mass during my childhood in Poland. Crisp cold air, mumbled singing of a solemn hymn, smoky vapours leaking down from golden incense holders, shuffling steps across worn-down tiles, S's and Z's breaking away from whispered prayers, reflecting off of stained glass images of saints and lambs to arrive as a shivvering breath in my ears.  The scent is totally inseperable from roman catholic mass. This can't be a scent that smells like 'you' to others, that you can make 'your' scent. It will always be you smelling like church."", 'I hate to be so ooverly critical, but i bought a 5 ml sample of this and was excited to try it. Tested it out the same day it arrived and my only honest reaction was it was flat out gross. It smelled like an old used book store. You know the kind of dank and mildewy smell. I even had my daughter smell it without saying anything to her what i thought, and her first words were ‚Äúit smells like mildew‚Äù. Even after dry down it never took on a pleasant or even tolerable scent.  I won‚Äôt even give it away because i would feel bad having someone else have to smell that way. No clue how people gave it good reviews TBH. Just don‚Äôt get it.', 'Soo vivid esp in the dry down, of church incense. My husband (not religious just a huge fan of Church Smell) said it feels sacrilegious to replicate this so identically. Love taking a whiff of this, but I join in everyone that would never wear this purely bc of association to Church lol.', ""It does remind me of Tuesdsy Catholic mass (yep, if your family was a practicing Catholic family at my school then you got to enjoy Catholic mass twice a week!) in parochial school if I close my eyes and concentrate hard enough. It's Catholic mass, but watered down and diluted to make it more approachable for the masses. It's right on the edge of being what one thinks of when talking about Catholic liturgical incense, but it just is not quite there. I thought from the reviews that I was going to smell this and be transported to the first time I ever step foot in a Catholic Church. Which kind of, but not really. This is not nearly strong enough to be considered truly Roman Catholic incense. Not to me anyway. It smells pretty watered down if that makes any sense. I like it, but probably will not be getting a full bottle because it just does not have that oomph I am looking for."", '#1221 in my ""Tour de Fragrance"" Got this as a decant. I don\'t blind buy anything over $100. When I see olibanum, myrrh and incense as notes in a scent named ""Series 3: Incense"" I expect some serious incense. I really don\'t get that here. Yesterday I wore Moresque ""Aurum."" That myrrh note wears combat boots! This fragrance is incense for beginners with no experience with incense, because if you\'d experienced any truly incense-forward scents, you\'d find this very weak by comparison. Not ""churchy"" in any cathedral or temple I\'ve been in, unless they have a special mild incense for the childcare area.  Nearly every scent that uses this ""everything and the kitchen sink"" approach (15 notes employed here) you get something pleasant but very non-descript and underperforming. The only exception I\'ve found is Penhaligon\'s ""Sartorial"" with 24 notes. I\'m confident I could pick it out from Nabeel\'s ""Master Perfumer Series"" like ""Al Bashiq"", which employs 44 notes. It\'s almost universally a mistake to formulate a scent that way. Can anyone actually distinguish one Jacques Bogart ""Silver Scent"" from the others? This Comme des Garcons scent comes across to me like that. Doesn\'t take a master perfumer to dump in everything you have on the shelf.  This is certainly safe for any use because it\'s simply not that potent, and it\'s pleasant, but makes no lasting impression. It\'s a non-performer that fades away before lunch, doesn\'t draw any notice or compliments, and at $120 that\'s disappointing. Won\'t be a bottle buy for me.', 'The reviews are unanimous: this smells exactly like going to Mass. Never having been to Mass myself, I don‚Äôt have all the feelings Catholics (and ex-Catholics) seem to have about this: it‚Äôs not triggering or nostalgic or sacreligious to me. But YMMV. The opening is an incredibly unfriendly, dry and lemony, frankincense. It‚Äôs dusty. It‚Äôs not exactly pleasant. It‚Äôs pure and austere. It mellows in the drydown quite a bit and starts to smell more like a typical ‚Äúincense perfume‚Äù. I imagine that‚Äôs the myrrh and labdanum. But you can still smell the lemony-dusty top note, plus a somewhat ‚Äúmedicinal dried herbs‚Äù smell from the chamomile. I like the style of perfume this is ‚Äî it‚Äôs a modern (post-90‚Äôs, I think) niche phenomenon, to make a perfume that smells like one thing, very vividly, and just a hair too intense or offbeat to be merely pleasant, while still being a thing a human *can* enjoy wearing. The ‚ÄúFuck Yeah‚Äù school of perfumery; like ‚Äúfuck yeah, bitter leather‚Äù or ‚Äúfuck yeah, campfire smoke‚Äù or ‚Äúfuck yeah, oud‚Äù. It‚Äôs not really ‚Äúone note‚Äù but it is thematic; kind of the way Borodin or Mussorgsky would do something musical *with* a folk theme but it‚Äôs still very legibly what it is. Avignon is ‚Äúfuck yeah, lemony/dry incense‚Äù. And that‚Äôs not, I think, a smell I‚Äôm crazy about; I like a lot of incense types but not especially this one; but I like the clarity of it. Bertrand Duchafour is the ‚Äúunfriendly incense‚Äù king; he‚Äôs also responsible for austere, smoky/dusty things like Timbuktu and Copal Azur. I tend to like my dark/bitter perfumes with a little more warmth and richness for balance ‚Äî the way a good Scotch is never outright sweet but is a bit mellow ‚Äî but if you struggle to find incense that‚Äôs heartless enough for you, try Avignon.', 'Why is no one mentioning the overwhelming balsamic note that persists? To my nose, this is eau de pine-sol. The heavy camphorous onslaught overwhelms any notes that might balance this out. Is there incense...maybe;maybe not? Hard to isolate anything other than balsam for me. After about 3-4 hours, I detect a faint sweetness under the balsam, but it struggles to reveal any character. The longevity is great, but who wants to smell like a Christmas tree all day?', ""After searching high and low for a true-to-life ecclesial incense fragrance, I thought Avignon would be the end of my quest. Unfortunately, the only thing I‚Äôm searching for now is the exit from the room this scent occupies. It smells like the mingled perfume of a hundred grandmothers at a funeral reception‚Äîheld down the hall, past the bathrooms‚Äîfrom a chapel that might have used incense about a month ago. Despite all the hype, this was a major letdown. It opens with a sharp, perfumey blast: aldehydic, synthetic, and overwhelming. There‚Äôs none of the deep resin, sacred smoke, or quiet atmosphere I associate with real liturgical incense. I spend a lot of time around actual church incense and wooden pews, and this doesn‚Äôt come close. Instead, it‚Äôs loud, artificial, and oddly floral, with none of the reverence or stillness I was hoping for. In the end, it smells less like incense and more like Grandma Mildred‚Äôs dry-clean-only church outfit after it's absorbed a few years of cheap floral fragrances‚Äîmusty, cloying, and long past its prime. Deeply disappointing."", ""derby2169 spot on. The smell of a cavernous Catholic church an hour after Mass on a cool, bright summer's day. It smells airy and cool, the incense is gentle, blending into resinous beeswax polish on wood, and a hint of leather kneelers. Meditative."", 'I like it more than Kyoto. A woody version of dried tangerine peel? It‚Äôs sour with a hint of animalic notes, and the woody scent is very prominent. It reminds me of the scent in an old church. The animalic notes become even more noticeable in the dry-down, possibly due to the frankincense.', 'pure church incense', ""Pinnacle incense smoke condensed off of cold marble Arguably the best incense/olibanum note ever created. The perfect amount of smoke, tartness and resinous density. There is something particularly divine about Avignon that is hard to describe, on one hand very similar to the Jovoy incense offering and Cardinal, but simply better, truer in terms of balance and proportion. Not the most naturalistic or high quality, rather perfectly manipulated to create more so the experience of smelling frankincense smoke.  While it definitely encapsulates the smell of a catholic church, it doesn't remind me of mass as much as the smell of a church several hours after mass, perhaps on a cool afternoon, where the smoke has slowly condensed, almost like an imaginary icy distillate forming on cold marble pillars.  Very meditative and otherworldly, on the other hand, possibly off putting when smelt on a human, austere and highly introverted, cosmic almost.  On my skin it has a curious effect of emerging a few minutes after spraying. I dont know if it is a matter of the perfume oil heating up, but I get the most robust performance about 1-3 hours in. Before that it feels shy and after that more so intimate, although surprisingly long lasting."", 'Don‚Äôt need to really add to the reviews that say this smells like a church - it obviously does. For me, the sweet waxy almost sickly note is what sold it. This is gilded Catholicism. I was between this and Zagorsk and to me, Zagorsk is a very realistic church scent too but it‚Äôs less in your face - it‚Äôs more green and peppery and doesn‚Äôt quite have the headiness of Avignon.', ""Well I tested it out and yeah it smells like a church where they've been burning incense (frankincense) on coals and I think it's good. Now I'll say I much prefer the smell of melted frankincense (like lower temperatures so no burning just melting) but in truth this is also a good way to do it. I terms of occasions you might want to wear this is cold weather or for formal occasions such as church or an event, but this isn't mass appealing and will mostly be interesting to people I think. Now I considered buying this but the price is way to high (90 euros for 50ml for reference that's like 180 euros for 100ml which is far more than what most would be comfortable paying), and frankly I'm not willing to spend as much per milliliter no matter the smell or the house. I think there's other alternative's where you can also get good frankincense fragrances I haven't found them yet I'm still searching for that distinct melted frankincense smell."", ""Avignon captures an exact moment in time. It is the last whiff of church incense, one second before smoke and resin is snuffed out of existence. The crumbling coldness of ancient cathedral stone juxtaposed against the warmth of scared vapors. This captures light and dark, and is seductive in a way that feels like taking a lover in a darkened crypt during Catholic mass. I detect some cirtusy Frankincense in here, stacked on some beautiful beautiful resins. The combination of smoky powder and dense, gummy rocks of resin makes this one of the most gorgeous photorealistic incense perfumes I've ever set my nose on. I understand why this is the reference incense for so many- it's sacred and sensual, and absolute perfection. Need a full bottle. UPDATE: I got the full bottle. 10/10"", 'Creepy.', 'polish catholic church, love it', 'Cold, mysterious, thick scent. It lasts a very long time. In my opinion it doesn‚Äôt have the citrusy quality of burning frankincense resin. Nevertheless, it is quite churchy. A sophisticated incense, not a new age joss stick. Truly unisex. Not gimmicky. Can‚Äôt imagine wearing it with anything but total black.', ""Definitely best incense fragrance i have ever smelled. Cold, wooden, catholic church incense with a bit of pepper (or other spice) in the opening. The scent doesn't develop much relative to opening, but I don't consider it a disadvantage. Easy to wear in my opinion, especially for people who dress in any alternative way/goth/fashionable. If only they had greater projection, I would definitely use them all the time."", ""I decided to blind buy this one because of the comments saying it smells like a Catholic Church and the only thing I can say is.... It's truly perfection.  I've been with an eye on this fragrance for some time now because I was curious and wanted one that had a close smell to a Church so I decided to buy it for Christmas and I don't have much to say... Just that it really does smell like it!  The only thing I'm not that happy it's because they don't have the 100ml version but still... I'll make sure this one lasts on my collection because it's a masterpiece for me :)"", 'If there was ever a cold smelling perfume it would be Incense Avignon, very very big aldehydes in the opening companied by the incense resembling of a clean white smoke when u burn an incense stick, doesn\'t smell like a resinous incense or a smokey incense per se, smells like you\'re in an empty church and u light up an incense stick but all you can smell is the transparent white smoke in the air, i get the ever so slight vanilla giving a little sweetness in the background but it\'s not very prominent, i find the aldehydes to last through the very end of the lifespan of the fragrance, it fades down in the mid but i call always get this aldehydic, clean, almost musky aldehydes, which could be what some of the ppl in the reviews are referring to, i don\'t find it off-putting i think it works in the composition quite well. The more it dries down i can almost detect a powdery feel along side the amber, it\'s not a thick amber, nor a ""true"" amber, at least that\'s not what i\'d consider an ambery dry down but it definitely has an ambery feeling to the dry down, i think it\'s a brilliant composition, it\'s definitely a joy to wear and a breath of fresh air from all the redundancy we keep seeing in the fragrance market, in terms of performance yes it\'s very light and it sits close to the skin, i also find it to play peekaboo in a sense where it despairs at times and come back again, i can\'t always detect it which gives more intrigue to the composition, in conclusion, amazing from Comme Des Garcons and Bertrand Duchaufour.', 'The cathedral in Strasberg right after Sunday services. Very cool experience. Saw graffiti from the 1600s on the wall by the cock. Unfortunately the performance is subpar.', ""I like this scent - I love incense. But... the dishsoap/bubblebath/fairy liquid element is something I really wish it didn't have. And its performance is poor. It's a light incense, pleasant, vaguely churchy - but just off churchy; it really doesn't capture the real nature of church incense (and I've spent many years in the highest of high churches). There is a loose, light dry spice in the background; a sort-of mulled-wine-y hodgepodge. I like it, but... surprisingly, not a love from me. I wish it was darker, deeper, more meditative - and less bright and soapy-clean. I see lots of comments below on the 'clean-ness' and 'lightness/thin-ness', and I should have paid more attention. Honestly, I think real incense lovers will get more mileage out of Majd al Sultan for ¬£18/100ml, than from this at ¬£70/50ml. There is some cross-over in the spiced incense, though they are not straighforwardly similar. But the Majd al Sultan has more smoke, depth, a greater range of resins - and no Fairy liquid. The Majd al Sultan also powers through a day, and this is a very short-lived experience."", ""Very enjoyable wear. The aldehydes make this shine. Clean, with a touch amber and incense. It does have a similar vibe to Dior Sport 2021 and that's not a bad thing."", 'The first time I sampled Avignon, it was sweltering high summer and I was not prepared to appreciate it. I found it too clean and thin‚Äîit initially made me think less of the wooden pews, stone walls, and soaring vault of a cathedral and more of a spotless church bathroom. Being accustomed to the woodier notes of the other fragrances in CDG‚Äôs Incense series, I was a little confused by its airy, fizzy, vanilla-cola sweetness. (Having attended catholic mass exactly once in my life, I also had next to no familiarity with church incense itself). I rated Avignon as my least favourite of the series, with the caveat that I still haven‚Äôt sampled Jaisalmer. How things have changed! Now that the chill of autumn has set in, I‚Äôve been craving warmer, sweeter, resinous aromas and seeking out more amber and incense perfumes. I‚Äôve grown very fond of the incense bases in CDG 2 Man and Eris‚Äô Scorpio Rising, in which incense is blended with leathery notes‚Äîalso the case in Trudon‚Äôs Revolution and CDG Zagorsk, both of which I enjoy. Trudon Mortel is a dark, spicy (but still woody) take on church incense that led me down the path of appreciating ecclesiastical frankincense and myrrh as the focus of a fragrance, and Jovoy‚Äôs Liturgie des Heures is an even purer church incense with a rich, musky, slightly boozy amber sweetness. But coming back to Avignon in this frame of mind revealed a completely new experience. In cold weather, its chilly austerity unfolds its celestial wings, clean and pure. It‚Äôs relaxing and meditative, with a fine, rarefied sweetness that develops from the sparkling elemi/aldehyde c-12 opening into a subtle, resinous vanilla. The blending of the various notes (chamomile, labdanum, ambrette, cedar, patchouli, rosewood, oakmoss) is superbly smooth and unified, like the harmony of voices in a Gregorian chant‚ÄîI salute Bertrand Duchaufour‚Äôs mastery! I‚Äôve gone from being intrigued to borderline obsessed, craving a sniff of aldehydic olibanum even on days when I feel like wearing a different fragrance. I still have a list of other church-incense frags to try (with Filippo Sorcinelli at the top), but now I get why Avignon is such a revered reference. I‚Äôm a convert. üôè', 'Smells beautiful, though this is the same incense profile that most of the big name ""churchy incense"" scents are going for, so if you have Heeley Cardinal, Jovoy La Liturgie des Heures, etc. then you probably don\'t need this one. Sillage and longevity are pretty sub-par, definitely only appropriate for enjoying at home or for throwing on for a few quick errands out of the house, etc. The rest of the scents in this line from CdG, while they suffer from similar performance issues, are all fantastic and worth grabbing. This one just has many other options that smell the same with better performance. I\'d personally recommend Histoires de Parfums Encens Roi if you\'re after this smell but with some legs.', 'I imagined a huge Catholic cathedral, but for me this perfume is more like a small cozy church in a pine forest. The durability and sillage are quite standard, nothing special. For its price it is very good. But I personally do not see this fragrance as an everyday one, it is unusual in a good way. A very photorealistic church smell.', 'Not at all what I was expecting, nor does my nose line up with the other reviews on here. There‚Äôs a vaguely nice powdery incense here that is unfortunately disguised by a sour unpleasant note. It almost smells like a cleaning spray, or urinal cakes as another person mentioned. To me it comes across very headachey. Thankfully the projection is very minimal.', 'A solemn Catholic church with gorgeous wafts of chamomile- absolutely transportive!', 'So I actually blind bought this since I am obsessed with churchy fragrances and everybody was saying that it smells exactly like a gothic cathedral. I was NOT disappointed, it‚Äôs one of the most beautiful scents I own and it‚Äôs just so warm, very incensy , lowkey spicy (but the spice kinda disappears after an hour or so and you are just left with a balsamic incense) in other words: if you are into incense and thinking of blind buying this one- you won‚Äôt be disappointed, it‚Äôs a safe blind buy imo. I literally can‚Äôt stop smelling my wrist because it‚Äôs so good, smells very luxurious. A little bit masc leaning, but still very unisex', ""On my second bottle and will absolutely be buying a third. It is every bit worthy of its acclaim. A transcendent, intoxicating, dare I say sexy fragrance. So spicy and mysterious and dark but not heavy. It is smoky but not ashy - more so very true to incense, full of spice and warmth. I agree with reviews saying it has a cola aspect, but it does not come off as gourmand to me.  I would like to smell like this for every second of every day if possible (but it is not, because it disappears SO quickly). The bottle is fairly small so I have to ration - it doesn't help that if I'm feeling very serious I will spray multiple times in a day. If it was longer lasting it would be an absolutely perfect fragrance. But it's probably for the better, because I would be far too full of myself if I smelled like this all of the time. Highly highly recommend trying if you're on the fence."", 'This is a classic ‚Äúchurchy‚Äù incense perfume and gosh, I love it. It‚Äôs exactly what you expect from the title: smoky, resinous, a little spicy. The incense is obviously prominent but it‚Äôs well balanced by the resinous/balsamic notes so it smells more like a perfume and less like, you know, an incense stick. That being said, I think you‚Äôd have to like incense perfumes to enjoy this. And I do! Really good projection and longevity, too.', 'Mandatory wear before attending your local Batcave party. Wear this while dancing to The Passion of Lovers by the Bauhaus. This is the ultimate goth fragrance for all the children of the night out there!', 'Comme des Garcon Incense-Avignon makes me think of Jesus Christ. It smells like a Catholic Church, that was just under sanctification and purification from the thurible carrying Frankincense, Myrh and Olibanum. Every wooden bench was laced by this invigorating smell. This scent is nostalgic because it brings me back to my childhood years in Azores, while frequenting churches. If you want to experience, what this makes me think of, give it a try.', '""Comme des Gar√ßons Avigon"" is a very distinctive and polarizing fragrance, with a scent reminiscent of a Catholic church or incense, which can evoke strong personal memories or associations. Its uniqueness might make it a love-or-hate fragrance, and i suggest that it\'s not something to purchase without trying first. While it has good longevity, its sillage isn\'t particularly strong. ""Bakhoor,"" a traditional incense used in the Middle East, adds an interesting cultural reference, helping to convey the type of scent to those familiar with it. Overall, while i appreciate its uniqueness, it\'s not necessarily a fragrance\xa0for\xa0everyone.', 'A beautiful perfume that evokes medieval, gothic cathedrals steeped in centuries of incense. You can smell cold stone and wooden benches, as well as dust dancing in the stained-glass light. More of a winter/fall scent because it is thick and warm, and might not interact well with sweat.', 'This scent is amazing. It really does evoke an old romantic gothic cathedral or church. I smell incense of course but there‚Äôs definitely old woods, resins, varnish or polish. There‚Äôs also just a hint of vanilla. This isn‚Äôt for everyone. I‚Äôd say this leans masculine, but a woman could wear it. I‚Äôd also say this is definitely for someone mature that is distinguished. I absolutely love this fragrance. It‚Äôs a rather small bottle. I got a 50ml bottle for 100 bucks. Also there‚Äôs not a lot of stores that carry this fragrance it seems. Again I would recommend this fragrance. I‚Äôve never smelled anything like it.', ""It's a likeable fragrance but definitely not a cologne/perfume because it potency is lower than a room spray. needs to be in a oil strength"", ""When it comes to incense, especially church-inspired incense, one of the most frequently mentioned names is Comme des Gar√ßons Series 3 Incense: Avignon. As a fan of incense and resins, I had to try this iconic scent. Right from the start, I was greeted by the Roman Catholic style of myrrh and olibanum, instantly recognizable from the countless hours spent in church with my grandmother. It perfectly captures the solemn ambiance of gothic cathedrals, with their vast, high halls and tapestries that have absorbed the sacred frankincense aroma for centuries. Surprisingly, it doesn't turn dark like many church incense fragrances do, and I think this is due to the chamomile. The chamomile and vanilla in the dry down make it lighter and more airy as it settles. I can see why this is considered a benchmark in incense fragrances. More than 20 years old and still going strong, it‚Äôs a contemplative and timeless masterpiece. A must-try for all incense lovers."", 'churchy', ""I grew up in a very Catholic country. The smell of incense in the church is always in my head. I can't say I love incense perfumes, but I can appreciate the well made ones. To my nose all of the series from Comme des Garcons, unfortunately, don't smell realistic. There is something synthetic, screechy underneath them all that fails to embody that hypnotic scent of true incense. They all smell very similar, but give such a headache, they are simply too much, whereas true incense in the church is spiritual, invigorating and captivating."", 'This is my favourite one of the series. The one and only downer being that it is the shortest lasting perfume I have ever worn, you would be lucky if it lasts more than twenty minutes.', 'The more I wear this, the less it seems like an entirely literal take on the smell of a Catholic Church, and more like a subtle beautification of that smell. It‚Äôs almost impressionistic. Monet‚Äôs paintings, for example, capture the essence of light and nature, transporting you to the scene‚Äîbut he exaggerates and simplifies certain tones to create an overall harmonic effect. Similarly, with Avignon you immediately understand that it‚Äôs a church incense fragrance, but that incense is supported by the dry woodiness of cedar and a vague warm spiciness (cinnamon? nutmeg? I don‚Äôt know). This is one of Comme des Garcons‚Äô greatest strengths as a house, that they can make something that straddles the line between an edgy literal representation and a perfume-y sort of familiar style. Wear this if you‚Äôve ever been called ‚Äúpretentious.‚Äù', 'This is exactly what I was looking for. Same scent as walking into an old Catholic Church in Europe.', ""I don't remember how the story started, what exactly I was looking for and how I first came across Comme des Garcons - Incense Series 3 Avignon. I was probably looking for incense perfumes, cool, enigmatic, impenetrable, spiritually charged and mysterious perfumes. Initially intrigued by the minimalistic and cool design of the bottle, I suspected that its humble facade was hiding rich secrets, so I set about researching, curious to learn its secrets. ‚ÄûPowerful and intense, Avignon evokes the medieval city in the south of France which surpassed Rome as the Catholic Church's power center in the 14th century. It's the scent of gothic cathedrals and Papal palaces, of tapestries imbued with centuries of incense. Of cold marble steps, holy relics and dark confessions. The recognizable smells of frankincense and myrrh open the high mass of Avignon, giving way to the almost eye-smarting, gloriously smoky and resinous heart. A dry vanilla and soft Roman chamomile dull the edges of this reverent fragrance. Beautiful, dark and mysterious, Avignon takes its place among the most talked about (and admired) of CdG's entire line.‚Äù Cold marble steps and tapestries imbued with centuries of incense? Say what? Storyteller at heart (or so I like to think), I had no escape, they convinced me with words. Although an agnostic at heart, I always yearn for the silence and darkness of Gothic cathedrals and dream of the secrets hidden within the cold stone walls. I blame the grandparents who forced me to church as a child, and the tour guides who dragged us around the historic cathedrals in Europe. Once inhaled, that smell of incense is hard to forget. And although I don't see myself converting to any religion anytime soon, CdG won me over forever with this perfume. This sound quite dramatic, maybe I took it too far. But that's what Avignon offers, an imaginary journey through the mists of centuries, far removed from daily routines and boring weekdays. At the same time, it induces a meditative state of calm, not necessarily of resignation, but acceptance, it makes you turn your attention inwards for once."", 'recently i only wear this, or a frankincense oil. my mum keeps telling me i smell like a house party in the 90s, she taught me how to make mulled wine like they did in the coven. i live next to to a catholic church and i just renewed my lease (this smells good)', 'I was told that this was a modern classic, and one of the reason why every brand has an incense ""soliflore"" in their offerings now. It\'s hard not to see why. The chamomile-aldehyde-frankincense accord is truly iconic. I grew up Catholic, and this is the only incense scent that really reminds me of service. It nails the powdery, gossamer quality right. It\'s a shame that it dies quick and devolves into almost pure iso e super and ambrette. Otherwise it\'s perfect. Also, don\'t get Incense Full. Yes, it\'s close enough but it lacks that X factor that Avignon has. Also that thing has too much cedar and patchouli that takes me out of the atmosphere.', 'Is my nose cooked? Have I been bamboozled? I adore incense and I have been dying to try this fragrance. First of all, I do not get any smoke which is crucial to a fragrance all about incense, in my humble opinion. Also, it is somewhat cold and I think of incense as being warm and enveloping. I do understand the references to the cold and spacious stone architectures of churches, but I do not think that is translated well here. It is oddly fizzy too. I am reminded of a strange cola or Pez candies. Quite the unexpected vibe. That mixed with the synthetic hint of a hint of cheap unburned incense stick makes it smell like incense-flavored La Croix. Help.', 'Myrhh and olibanum burning inside a medieval castle in a forest of cedar trees. üè∞‚öîÔ∏èüõ°Ô∏èüìú‚öúÔ∏èüïØÔ∏èüìñüíÄüî•üå≤', 'Icy cold incense, spice, resin. Strangely fizzy as others have noted.', 'As someone that grew up in the church I‚Äôve been very excited to try avignon since I learned of its existence. I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised at how unisex it is. Although I will say it would be an exceedingly handsome fragrance on a man and is very goth / intimidating on a woman.  Surprisingly sweet on application but on the skin is very woody (cedar plank specifically) and spicy.  Very picturesque scent of Catholic incense to me, maybe less smoky than the real thing but I think this makes it more versatile. I would recommend as a blind buy if this sounds interesting to you. I could easily see this as an everyday scent for lots of men and any woman with the right sense of style.', 'A few hours ago I started my day with Incense Avignon, the king of incense fragrances in my book. It leaves the perfect little scent bubble for me as I move around, and just enough for others to wonder what it is they just smelled. While it is a liner scent on me, I appreciate the frankincense not being soapy and having a slight citrus like brightness to it. It smells clean, elegant, and refined. I feel the use of pure and top quality ingredients surround me. The nostalgia takes me back to catholic grade school ash wed. This is frankincense laying on a woody base, nothing sweet. I appreciate the fragrance.', ""I've got this, Kyoto and Zagorsk going head to head. Kyoto has a lovely, bright, clean, non-smoky, non-stinky, yuzu-ish or lemony incense resin thing going on. There's more than a hint of fruity bubblegum sweetness in the top but there's also a kind of understated fullness or roundness underneath. The fragrance reminds me of fresh ginger, cardamom, lemongrass (honeyed Indonesian lemongrass tea) and probably clean vetiver too but the rounder aspect makes me think of--I don't even know what--lemon candy? Honey, even? Beeswax? (Edit: it may be just immortelle.) At any rate the fragrance is not all top-end zing but I do think that's a huge part of what it has to offer. Zagorsk is more recessed and perhaps comes perilously close to lacking detail and being too dry or dark (though not at all in a heavy way) to make much of an impression. I don't get any big hit of sauna wood but the many descriptions I've read regarding walking through a coniferous forest in cold weather, more than likely with snow on the ground, with just a hint of a kind of greenish woody incense in the air (quite possibly, yes, from an Orthodox church) are on point. The touch of ambery powder here is nice. It almost makes me think of snow. The fragrance is quite soft, impressionistic and definitely reserved but I like it. Essentially I see almost a clear, bright yellow or green-yellow (straw) resin with the Kyoto, whereas Zagorsk is more green, like pine resin or mastic. Avignon is somewhat fuller, rounder and probably sweeter than either. There's citrusy sweetness in Kyoto but Avignon has the myrrh and so on, and essentially there's more ambery dark-resin sweetness in Avignon than in the other two. Avignon is the gummiest of the three--not in terms of bubblegum fruitiness but in terms of almost rubbery resin or balsam. It's still quite soft and impressionistic, but at its core, of the three fragrances, it probably does offer the biggest dose of incense of the kind that many of us in Western Europe or the Americas are most familiar with in the context of church. Is any of the three full-bottle worthy? It depends what you're looking for. Kyoto would probably be lovely in cool spring or autumn weather (but maybe more the spring for me). The picture that Zagorsk paints favours cold weather but I'm not sure the fragrance has quite enough presence to stand up to that, so for me it may be a scent that, like the original Encre Noire, is lovely but suffers a little from not being quite convincingly suitable for the kind of context where in principle it should most shine. Kyoto and Zagorsk particularly are quite delicate, though not in completely the same way. They would be great for indoor relaxation and reflection. Because it's a little fuller, sweeter and more opulent, with a little more presence--at this moment, it reminds me of the far, far bolder and less sophisticated Bentley Intense--Avignon may be the only one of the three that I would feel comfortable wearing in the winter as well as the autumn. Then again, I am a huge Smiths and Morrissey fan and was probably always likely to prefer Avignon. CdG perfumers, take a bow. There's always someone somewhere with a big nose who knows."", 'Excellent quality Myrrh perfume. It has a certain coldness which is not the direction I would have taken, but which describes well French cathedrals and the smell of their old stones.  A refreshing departure from mainstream fragrances. The dry down on the next day is excellent.  (Tested on paper) I am comparing this with Jovoy La Lithurgie des Heures. This one is better imo, although both are of good quality.', ""I finally got my hands on this beauty and I am so happy. Not much to say except that this is a gorgeous Catholic Church smell, which oddly reminds me more of old England than France, not sure why.  Sweet, yet moody, perfectly gothic. Catholic aesthetics without being dogmatic. I own Zagorsk and surprisingly I find Avignon more familiar and nostalgic church scent, even though I grew up in an Orthodox country. There's definitely some magic in this perfume.  I get a decent longevity of around 3 hours and sillage is also moderate. Perfectly unisex. Nothing else to say but endless compliments to this fragrance!"", ""This is such an amazing and unique fragrance. To me it smells like an old cathedral where the gobelins and heavy velvet curtains have been soaking in frankincense and myrrh smoke forever. I just need to close my eyes and I feel like I'm teleported there. The resinous, spicy and smoky notes make Avignon mysterious and meditative. It leaves a pleasant, sweet trail in my nose, I think its the vanilla. Perfect to wear with black, elegant clothes. It gives me a big gothic vibe that I cannot compare to any other fragrance I have smelled yet"", 'The opening has a strong and beautiful cistus note, smells like a Catholic mass. A balsamic scent overall, beautifully blended. I wish the projection was stronger, but then again it\'s not necessarily a ""crowd pleaser"" scent. Very meditative and personal, but not offensive in any way. Not too smoky or dark, but leans masculine in my opinion.', 'simply love this. everyone in my life tells me it fits me so well. Such a beautiful fragrance', ""Incense, all the way. But is it church incense or new age store incense? At first spray, it reminded me of the incense sticks my brother burned in high school to cover up the smell of weed. But after a while, it was straight church incense. I was immediately back at one of the many beautiful Polish churches here in Chicago, being blessed with the incense, imagining my prayers floating up to heaven with the smoke. There's a touch of a soft, creamy note- likely the vanilla and musk. However, Avignon is not sweet or sexy at all. It's a celibate perfume. This is definitely masculine leaning but I would still wear it. The sillage is decent, several hours later I'm still getting hits of frankincense and myrrh."", 'Purchased this after I bought Full Incense by Montale. I am intrigued by churchy scents for some reason. Avignon and Full Incense are brothers (or sisters depending on your sex). FI is the loud, outgoing one whereas Avignon prefers to stay at home with a good book and a cup of tea. Both are wonderful. Avignon was the academic ascetic child, where FI took to the stage as an actor or circus performer.', 'Realistic church vibes.', ""Dry unburnt incense sticks with a lot of resin sweetness.

Accurate smell of incense. It smells like what you'd probably expect it to smell."", ""This is the perfume Morrissey allegedly wears so I had to try it... Perfectly captures the incense they pull out on special days in Catholic Mass. Takes me back to having to sit through Lithuanian Easter Mass as a child without knowing a word of Latin or Lithuanian and choking on incense when the altarboy swings it a bit too close to your face; then it clings to your clothes for the rest of the day. It's a beautiful and nostalgic scent for me, but I can see how this could be weird or uncomfortable to someone who is not Catholic or has bad memories associated with Catholicism. Moderate projection.. the person you're speaking to could smell it but not the whole room. While I enjoyed testing this, I couldn't see myself wearing it often. If I smelled this on someone I would assume they were in the clergy or very devout.. so if that's the vibe you're going for this is a great perfume for you."", ""A very realistic church smell to me; dry, cold and woody church to be exact. It opens with a strong resin smell, but the drydown is pure cedar and smoke from the incense. It really reminds me of the smell of the freshly sharpened wooden pencil! Generally really loved it as a base for layering with something else. It's great if you want pure incense / frankincense smell, but it can be a bit too monotone (I loved it nonetheless)"", ""there's a weird fizziness in this that really perplexes me. it goes away pretty quickly but i struggle with it. after it goes away i find it extremely beautiful but i'm not sure if i can get past the fizz to warrant a full bottle. i think it does what it's looking to do really well though"", 'Bought blind, taking advantage of a great offer, I fell in love with it at the first spray and was particularly impressed with its performance on my skin, both in terms of projection and longevity. It is a powerful and extremely evocative scent that puts you in a church during a service. It is not just incense; it carries with it all the suggestions of the liturgical environment. Sweet, yet cold and icy thanks to its surprising balsamic characteristics, it recalls the dense smoke of incense grains burning in censers, with the addition of masterfully blended notes capable of perfectly recreating the scent of the interior of a majestic cathedral: wood, moisture, sharp lights and shadows, the choirs of the faithful, silence, the altar. It explodes on my skin, spreads out for at least half a meter and remains there, imperishable, for well over six hours, while rather than smelling it on me, I feel it around, like a mystical aura surrounding myself. I find something devilish in its perfection, between the sacred and the profane: it is the sheepskin the wolf wears to infiltrate the flock, the fancy dress the swindler wears, the smile of politeness of one who refuses a favor, the witchcraft that hides deception. Yet its light remains dazzling, its icy coldness sweet and attractive, like a lantern for moths. A weapon to be used wisely, rather than a perfume.', ""A decent church-y scent but not quite the specific church smell I'm chasing - it's a little too bright I think. I found the longevity and projection very poor which is why it's only getting an 'ok' from me."", ""Amazingly realistic incense perfume. Total cathedral in a bottle! At first, I thought it was gorgeous but maybe not wearable however, it is actually quite lovely on my skin. I want to try Zagorsk, it's sibling from CDG's incense collection because Avignon has a hint of stone, like you're in a stone church, and I am on the hunt for the same profile but with more of a wooden note. Definitely worth a try for a wearable yet realistic atmospheric scent. I got several compliments on this one!"", ""I don't like incense as a fragrance note but my curiosity to try Incense Avignon was piqued after finding out this is Morrissey's signature perfume. It is smooth and to my unsophisticated nose, one note.

You can thank me later.', 'I wanted to love this but it just smells like Hinoki.', ""Perhaps someone deeper into the fragrance world can enlighten me. If I want deep, rich, woodsy style incense perfumes that are true to their origin, where do I go to find a more feminine or true unisex twist besides Passage d'Enfer? I like Avignon, but like the fuller and more bombastic Encens Roi, which also has Avignon beat in terms of sillage and longevity, it skews masculine in a way that makes me not think of it as an everyday choice. There is a Japanese brand of incense, Shoyeido, makea incense fragrances that are delicate, woodsy and often a touch sweet. Where and what is that version of a frankincense perfume? I think I have homework to do.

While similar, Avignon is not as heavy on the cedar as Full Incense. I love both in their own right- but I find Avignon to be the softer, more wearable of the two.  Avignon has a fresh and balsamic feel- and evokes a sense of being in an intimate cathedral, set in an evergreen forest in rural France. High rafters within are crafted from cedar, the pughs of aromatic hardwood. The atmosphere is lit only by candles; censers of resins are alight, the smoke billowing.

With that in mind, even though Avignon and its incense -based sisters in the CDG studio are delightful at first impact, they are not as long-lasting as products such as Heeley\'s Cardinal (admittedly and Eau de Parfum, with a slightly lower concentration) or Sorcinelli\'s LAVS (The Very Best Incense-Based Perfume In The World, in my humble opinion).

Very meditative, transporting and enjoyable :)"", ""i get a blast of chamomile in the opening that honestly makes me nauseous - likely a scent memory of being sick and drinking chamomile tea. the woodiness it combines with is almost plastic, synthetic. there is a soapiness that smells like foaming hand wash to me - BAD. in short, the first 15 minutes of this were extremely challenging to get through - but i wanted to see what happened. i understand the references to catholic church but i wish it was a little darker and that there was less of a citrusy punch to the beginning. this one isn't for me unfortunately"", 'could be 4am or 6pm. you pull off the I-10 to an empty rest area; lock yourself into a musty bathroom stall. attempt to light a soggy cigarette. crack open a can of diet pepsi, and the sweet, slightly acrid fizz off the top reminds you how you hate all sodas.

I had really hoped this one was for me...', ""I was not raised Catholic, so I have no reference for the smell of incense, but I do love ceremony, pomp and all the grand edifices that the church created so I suppose I am coming at this fragrance with romanticized version of Catholicism in my head and so I experience this perfume as a kind of olfactory cultural artefact. It is dry and has almost no sweetness. As a smell its almost aloof because it doesn't smell like you're supposed to be wearing it and creates an intimate sillage that's almost medicinal in its character. I suppose if I were writing a scholarly article about this fragrance, I would say that Avignon turns your body into the sacred space and seems to be meant for a purifying or ritualistic experience in a very personal way."", 'I went into Avignon wanting to smell like a church, and it delivered. I\'m working off of a very small sample at the moment, but it was enough to confirm that I\'d be interested in a full bottle. It\'s admittedly pretty straight forward... resins, a touch of wood, a little sweetness (likely the vanilla and chamomile)... but that seems to be what this line of fragrances is going for with their direct inspirations from the incense blends of different traditions. As someone who was not raised Catholic but enjoys traditional liturgical resins and the lingering floral smell a church can carry, this feels accurate to what they wanted to present.  I would probably only recommend Avignon to someone who is seeking out that sort of smell, but then again, I\'d be surprised if anyone who didn\'t want ""churchy"" picked up a fragrance with this kind of reputation.', ""Like others have mentioned, I picked this up because this is said to be THE reference fragrance for incense. First Impression: big blast of chamomile followed by very realistic incense. Not just incense, but the headspace of a church with aged wood pews. I believe there's unlisted aldeydes that allow it to accomplish that headspace. Although I didn't grow up catholic or have any nostalgia associated with catholicism, I can appreciate this for it's realism and from what I remember from being in these churches, it's spot on. This fills a spot of an artistic and also useable incense fragrance for church, cold weather and evening use.

I was also completely enthused by the idea of smelling like an old, damp cathedral somehow. Well, I thought this would be extremely experimental and basically unwearable, but turns out I feel very at home wearing this.

If I shove my nose onto my skin I can pick up some more of the woods, but honestly, this is too weak to be anything but a disappointment.

You had the PTO, the money, the hankering and it all added up to booking wonderful accomodations and amazing sounding tours in and around Tokyo. GO. YOU.  Then from the moment your plane takes off from the airport in Atlanta on its\' way to Toronto it seems as though everything that could go wrong DID go wrong. Weird smoke in the cabin (it turned out to be a cloud of baby powder???) triggered a return to the airport and hours of waiting and dread and stress being heaped upon you--brick by brick, hour by hour--while you stared at the clock wondering if you would miss your connecting flight. And guess what! You did miss it. And you\'ll be getting there not just many hours after the original flight. 3 DAYS after the original flight. The hotel food in Toronto was bland and cold as you hunched over it with your phone making cancellations and re-reserving tours and lots and lots of ""I\'m sorry. There are no rooms available""\'s. You think about going back home but you don\'t. No. This is a bucket list item. You\'re doing it. When you\'re finally on the flight to Narita Airport you breathe a sigh of relief. Then 3 hours in you feel weird grumbly liquidy feelings. Diarrhea. The bland food in Toronto\'s vengeance was upon you. Barely able to sleep an hour at a time you land exhausted, dehydrated and defeated to a degree you\'ve never experienced. This was a mistake. You get to your hotel in Shibuya swimming in sorrow. You quickly fall into a black, dreamless slumber for 15 hours straight.  When you wake up you decide to try to see if something will finally go as it should. You go for a walk to explore the beautiful area around the hotel and you start to feel a little better. Maybe it wasn\'t a mistake. You work your way away from the heavily crowded touristy areas. You decide to let go and allow fate to lead you wherever it may. Not long after you do you walk near a fenced area with a small rock garden. Next to the garden stands a wooden temple with a tiled roof surrounded by beautifully groomed trees. The gate is open. You step inside. You are completely alone as you make your way towards the temple. You remove your shoes, make your way inside to sit on a small cushion and you begin to meditate. As you sit in silence you are enveloped by the smell of incense, the faint decay of unimaginably ancient woods felled and shaped with handcrafted tools and sacredness. You feel the most profound sense of welcoming, peace, compassion and acceptance you\'ve felt in years.', ""I've never been to a catholic church so I have no idea what that smells like, but if it smells like this I really like it!

It's clean, dark, cosy. I thought it would be much stronger and meaner but it's not at all. It's more of a softer skinscent with a vintage vibe to it. I really like this one!

Even for a 21st-century sceptic raised atheist in a historically Protestant country, this is Old Church personified. It is some time in the early fourteenth century and you are right there in the opulent, grandiose, world-changing court of the Avignon Anti-Popes and big things are happening. Most notably a massive gilded thurible is swooshing all around your head, wreathing you in sacred smoke and the odour of sanctity.  Truly exceptionally beautiful, fresh and fizzy frankincense up top (and/or mimicked with aldehydes) which is somehow cool and green and aerated, as well as golden and honeyed and resinous. This might be the smell of an old stone church but there\'s not a whisper of damp or rot: it may seem dark and hallowed but it\'s dry too, dry as dust, dry as the crumbly pages of the parchment books and the most erudite scholars\' wit. It swathes you in history, swaddles you in heritage, saturates your skin and clothes with thousands of years\' worth of scent memories of reverence. And it also has that usual Duchaufour magic of letting the air and the light in, too: somehow you can sense the sunbeams, slanting in through scriptorium windows, which allows even this apparently heavy and ""thick"" atmosphere of resins to open up and sing, like the choir invisible. It\'s not all solemn ritual (like say Trudon Olim) - there is true joy and spontaneity there too. Glory be! Definitely shines most beautifully on warmer days in my experience, as you get the full rounded richness of the bottom end more clearly. But basically heavenly any time.

There are many good ones around, my favorite probably being Ciro by Trudon and Unum by Lavs. Those are also awfully expensive though and as much as I love the nuances in those fragrances, I'm beginning to think this one is probably the best bang for one's buck.

It smells exactly like walking into an old and beautiful Catholic church, reminding me of everything I once associated with awe and mysticism. The incense and spices notes of this are spot on. But once it's on skin it reads a little more mature and musty on me than I would like... might just be one of those cases where I love the smell, but I don't want to smell like it myself. It didn't have crazy sillage, but enough that in the first few hours I could smell it on myself and it was a little overwhelming. After that, it wore closer to the skin, more of the resins came out and it was more manageable, but in the long run I don't think I'm confident enough to pull this off.

I remember saving up for this for such a long time on an enthusiastic blind buy. I quite enjoy challenging scents and have many years' experience with real myrrh, frankincense, and benzoin. I'm sorry to say that Avignon didn't remind me of any of them. It was just a shrill, chemical cheesegrater to the nose. I've noticed negative reviews get very few balloons here on fragrantica -- but hopefully at least one person will benefit from my experience. In my research to discover why I hated what so many others enjoyed, I discovered it might be a genetic thing. I've heard response to ISO E Super is genetically determined, and my neurology just knee-jerk rejects it. If I may bring up a sensitive topic, ISO E Super, the base of this perfume, is a cause for concern beyond taste -- it is highly toxic to aquatic life, and it is biocumulative.

I definitely feel that this one is a sacred scent, so I put off purchasing it for the longest time, but after the year we've all had, part of me feels that nothing is sacred anymore... or maybe everything is sacred. Yes, that one. So there was no point in me putting off purchasing it or wearing it whenever I want. A lot of people think of incense as cerebral, moody, or even brooding, goth, etc. but I am finding Avignon to be purely pleasurable, cozy and uplifting without any thought or analysis involved. It has me both huffing my wrist and rolling around in it with abandon, as well as sticking it under the noses of all of my family members. It's absolutely perfect on this cold, foggy, rainy and windy spring day by the ocean. It fits the moods and the weather expertly. I have frankincense essential oil and this is truly like the frankincense incense burning in churches, not the essential oil which has more of a green, damp and earthy profile. Avignon is silvery dry and almost mineral with a smooth yet complex smoky woodiness. I wouldn't want it to be any stronger than it is. The ephemeral quality that others take issue with actually suits it quite well in my opinion. It's meant to swirl about you like a ghost, not slam into you like a solid wall of scent . I'm so grateful to finally have added this to my collection. It's so high quality and absolutely beyond words beautiful, as well as being an exemplary object lesson in Catholic church incense. Just wanted to add that if you're considering adding Avignon to your collection, I strongly suggest using Arielle Shoshana instead of Luckyscent. They overnight shipped my perfume the same day I ordered it for free and included a ton of samples I didn't even ask for. Also they're a small business and it's always better to go that route whenever possible."", ""This was unfortunately not the Incense I was looking for.

It smells like there was originally a more powerful, dark version that someone was told to dial back. Definitely wearable, but sillage and longevity for me were pretty poor, even with several sprays. I think I got much better performance with Kyoto Incense, and that was with a dabber sample. It\'s a fine, safe incense fragrance, but does not live up to the hype for me. Also, the bottle looks like room spray, not very stylish for nearly $100.', 'For me this is a joke that ends before the punchline. Longevity is awful, hour max before it melts into my pores. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm dabbing from a sample instead of spraying (I dabbed a good amount!) Really is a shame because I see what they‚Äôre trying to do. Even bigger shame because the little I see, I don‚Äôt love. Patchouli is prominent, and I dislike patchouli with incense. I‚Äôll keep on trying until my sample runs out but there are better incense frags for sure.', ""This is one of the most nostalgic incenses I've ever tried. Very very evocative of a Catholic church. For me, it brought me back to the Duomo in Milan; tall, imposing, grey stone. Despite feeling like a very 'serious' fragrance, there's something very clean and purifying in the drydown that makes me feel like I just got out of a very quiet Scandinavian spa.  This is the type of fragrance that may serve as a conversation starter but also doesn't quite suit any activity besides either quiet meditation of visiting the public archives to do research on architectural practices in the Middle Ages.  Lasts a good while, but doesn't need to project to be heard."", ""This smells really nice, and does smell like the incense that is burned in a church. Other than relaxing at home, I cannot find any other occasion for wearing this. Longevity on my skin was around five hours and it radiated within an arm's length.

To be precise, Aldehyde C-12 is responsible for that weird, unnatural, cool-tone, ""plastic""-‚Äúpiney‚Äù-‚Äúfizzling‚Äù top in Avignon. Some other brands (e.g. James Heeley) may use descriptors like ""fresh linen"" for such note. Why use aldehyde? My guess is, a lot of the natural extract of real frankincense/olibanum (""incense"")-- be it critical CO2, absolute, essential oil -- all smells very...challenging, to say the least. It reminds me of sharp wet paint, or new furniture which gave off toxic formaldehyde ‚Äî‚Äî perhaps that\'s why people burn incense, instead of extracting perfumes out of it.  Perhaps, that\'s also why perfumer Douchaufour chose Aldehyde C-12 to mimic the weird cool-tone ""plastic"" quality of incense, without setting off toxic odor alarm. Now back to Avignon, after the initial blast of aldehyde, we dive into soft, mellow, tuber-y bitter juice --which I caught in many other incense works, but yet to find what exactly this note is. Is it myrrh? Or just another facet of frankincense?  The ""plastic"" aldehyde is joined with a dry woody partner, and they dance with mellow bitter juice hand in hand for the rest of the journey. Before closing time, a bit of dry-date(the fruit)-like labdanum is exposed to air. Finally, everyone left, we\'re only left with dry ash of burnt balsamic.', ""Interesting fact, if you layer Full Incense by Montale, with Bentley Absolute (spray one on your wrist and other one on your neck, don't mix them), you'll get CdG Avignon. Maybe even better, you get more intense version of the incense little bit darker and dryer, and that spicy Coke vibe from Absolute, with some leathery touch. If they included benzoin and tobacco instead of vanilla and musk, this would have been so perfect. Only 9/10 for this masterpiece"", ""Avignon has become the reference incense for fragrance enthusiasts, and its hard to deny that compositionally it is evocative of a thurible swaying amongst the devoted in a Catholic church. It is a bit more than that, though, as it has elements that make it more impressionistic, more a perfume than purely a novel incense facsimile. We are not talking Demeter here.  Chamomile in the top note through the heart, lends a certain ineffable quality that reminds of its use in Aromatics Elixir, soothing and almost imparting a 'pastoral' feel that contrasts with the stark, stony chill of the olibanum and elemi overdose. The top, with the coniferous, spiky Aldehyde C-12, also lend to this chill that is soon warmed as myrrh, labdanum and what I can detect as cistus (the oil from the leaves rather than the resin of the Cistus ladanifer). In spite of the Iso E Super that lifts everything, Avignon is to my nose impressively imbued with naturals. The mildest shade of animalic, dry vegetal ambrette musk in the base makes for a really comforting skin scent in the dry down.  I now realize that this will be in my collection as not merely as a reference, but a true joy to wear. The cold yields to warm throughout its development, making it not quite as linear as has been suggested by others, and it surely suits me to a T during this snowy day in New England."", 'i love this, i always love when a memory or an identical scent to something is placed into a bottle for u too keep, however i do not know if i could pull this off as an actual perfume, idk what i would wear or where i would wear it too, that being said it is awesome for around the house very cozy. smells very much like spiritus sancti by cire trudon if you are looking for this in candle form btw!!.', 'This was love at first sniff. There is a wonderful bright citrus note that hovers right above the skin and almost acts as a buffer between your nose the deep incense at the crux of the fragrance.

It piques my interest in the other incense perfumes in this line.', 'Extremely incensey. Yes, Catholic Church vibes for sure. Strong and rather piercing on initial application. Dry down is warmer, less stark, mellow and more pleasant. Fairly sweet and deep; myrrh and frankincense stand out, but on me the myrrh rapidly diminishes. A distinctive scent. This isn\'t to my taste, but I acknowledge its quality and elegant appeal. Sillage is moderate, as is longevity. Update: almost 4 years later, I own, love, am currently wearing, and am addicted to this fragrance. What can I say ‚Äì maybe I ""didn\'t get it"" initially. But I soon changed my mind!', 'I sampled all of the CdG Series 3 Incense and Avignon was the most ""churchy"" to me. I suppose that makes sense if this the one to represent Catholicism, since I grew up in Christian circles. It\'s got that nice blend of sweet myrrh and bracing clean frankincense. Notes like labdanum and ambrette add to the ""ancient building filled with tapestries and old wood"" feeling.', 'A Catholic sick call cabinet. Spot on. Well done CdG.', ""When I first bought a sample of this, I absolutely hated it. It smelled medicinal, syrupy, and cloying. But I let the sample sit for another two weeks or so and then tried it again. The second time around, the fragrance had mellowed a lot. It's definitely a churchy incense; it reminds of me of nighttime mass in a warm cathedral. I've heard/seen a lot of people describing it as cold or wet but I absolutely don't feel that at all! Avignon smells warm and woody, like fresh incense smoke being burned in the moment. A lovely churchy scent, definitely a good buy if you like incense."", ""Luckily I just bought a sample of something I thought would smell ravaging on me, but I was sorely disappointed. I put it on and from beginning to end I could not get anything else but the Church incense. It certainly helped in bringing back long lost memories of myself attending church as a child, and seeing the priest use his beautiful censer that he would swing so that the smell would fill up the whole church. I didn't get any other notes than the church incense. I like the smell but I was expecting much, much more than this. I do believe that this fragrance and I haven't got the pleasure of opening up to each other. Maybe one day... I'm always hopeful!"", ""The unironic- Holy Smokes!- Holy Grail of incense burner perfumes. If you smelled several niche frankincenses and have ever been to a catholic church you know this is the dogma and the rest of them the apocryphal. Mass olibanum ricocheting against musty woods, mouldy stones, cold as marmol, searing dark as chimney smoke.  I'm still not a converse to full-incense fragrances but this is one sort of King-s-Layer, great for spraying over roses and spicy woods. I'd like to get a little chalice of this, and I'm not exactly Galahad ov'ere."", ""Fantastic frankincense! One of my favourite smells and most early scent memories‚Ä¶ This one delivers true to life churchy vibes, very realistic indeed. Heeley Cardinal is more airy and etherial, this is thicker, fuller. Not as dense as Bois D‚ÄôEncens perhaps, but I love the slightly creamier and lactonic, sandalwood feel of this one too.  Leaning more to foresty incense and sandalwoods these days rather than smelling straight up like a church at Easter though! This is where Bentley Absolute comes in‚Ä¶ Here, the nose of GPH1 and Bois D‚ÄôEncens Michel Almairac has made what feels like a best of both. It makes that churchy theme more contemporary and wearable with it‚Äôs added cedar and papyrus. Think of it like a blend of Bois D‚ÄôEncens or Avignon and Santal 33, roughly speaking, for around 30 bucks.  This is a stunning incense fragrance though and a fantastic choice for a frankincense fragrance but for now, I'm happy enough with my bottle of Bentley Absolute. That does away with the need for this, or Bois D‚ÄôEncens for now, because its added cedar and papyrus notes make it a more contemporary wearing experience than the straight up church incense of either of those. It's a great moody room scent too, and sandalwood a great meditative personal scent to wear everyday to get your zen on!"", ""It's like they managed to bottle a less traveled room at the British museum during a rainy evening. There are old books with leather covers on the shelves, aged wood desks, counters and ancient artifacts oozing resins behind see-through mirrors. But the mirrors can't keep their aroma from slowly seeping out. I love this scent."", 'Years later, I return for a second review. No more a goth, but a hopeless migraineur... Whatever hit me in the morning, I spritzed some YSL Nu, a long lost treasure, at the back of my neck, and on my wrists. Then I reached for my 2012 bottle of Avignon for a daring feat and just wanted to see what happens this time... Good news, I am still alive!  Further good news is that, I found Avignon to be much more mellow and softer, just like I wanted it to be, years ago... The sharp cedar note (which I tend to dislike) was subdued and way more rounder if not yet still gone.  Chamomile, elemi, most importantly, frankincense and myrrh, and the cold stone walls of a medieval church, St. Mary\'s in Guildford UK, coming once again alive before my eyes, the floors, wooden doors, the marble altar...  Not only the incense, but the maturated juice brought up much more of a complete atmosphere this time, down to finite details like the statue of Mother Mary, and red velvet fine drapes adorning the apse... The old me would unapologetically be like ""now is the most apt time for sex"", but today I found myself in only peaceful contemplation and not necessarily after manifesting the divine in the union of two bodies in flesh... It felt more ethereal and transcendent, as if I spent the night in church in prayer, covered in a shawl which is now oozing the scent along with my hair... Avignon is a masterpiece, and I would for once, like to smell this on the man I love.  Objectively, it\'s supposed to be awesome on anyone and everyone who has the taste to dare.  *YSL Nu is doubling the effect by playing the Orthodox part...', ""Suddenly I'm in a medieval church. In terms of accuracy to real-life scents, this is perfect. I don't go to church, so for me when I spray this on, the scent memory is from my travels. I'm transported to a dimly lit church somewhere in Italy. The busy street outside is muffled as the ancient wooden door closes behind me. I take my hat off out of respect for others' place of worship. Light is streaming in from the stained glass windows at the far end, but in the alcoves candles flicker. A faint murmur of a deeply-pitched hymn in the minor key reverberates around the stone floors and walls. Incense is burning on the altar and the varnished pews smell as old as they probably are. Was that pretentious? Definitely. But does Avignon actually do that for me? Absolutely. I love it when fragrances transport me away and this one is one of the best in this regard. But in terms of actually wearing this, it falls down a bit. It's incredibly austere and gothic and, well, smells like a church. It doesn't have massive performance which is actually a positive, as if this projected like a monster I could never even consider wearing it around people. But I may just like this enough to buy a bottle to wear when I'm alone and in the mood, or just spray on my hand to remind myself of its beauty. It's priced very well for the quality (this could easily be niche), so I might just be able to justify it. I like it a lot, potentially bottle-worthy. (dislike/indifferent/like, but not BW/like a lot, potentially BW/love, definitely BW/masterpiece)"", 'Christmas is hot and humid where I live. I don‚Äôt find the usual fragrances people recommend for Christmas suitable for such weather. Avignon is different. It does smell like wooden church pews, but it also smells like laundered sheets, now dry, cooling on the washing line in the late afternoon breeze. It‚Äôs not a summer scent but the fragrance itself does well in the summer. I also feel‚Ä¶ ‚Äòright‚Äô wearing it at Christmas, as though I am acknowledging what the holiday is about.  Incense (especially frankincense - Avignon smells similar to a piece of burning Omani frankincense) and cool palisander rosewood are at the heart of Avignon. Cool, dry, austere: don‚Äôt be fooled by the vanilla as there is nothing sweet and cuddly here. Linear and unisex. There are so many incense fragrances on the market now. What makes Avignon stands out for me is that ‚Äòcoolness‚Äô which makes it a great fragrance to wear on a hot summer‚Äôs day (or night) The perfect fragrance to wear to Mass on Christmas Eve‚Ä¶ or at least smell like I did.', ""Update: Of the three nearly identical fragrances: Avignon, Full Incense and Cardinal, I would say this is the most quick to flee from the skin and has the lowest projection. I'd say it's also the lightest of the fragrances and with the least amount of depth comparatively. For the price I think it's fabulous and it has a drier, cooler feeling than the other two, so it would be appropriate through a different portion of the year.  Original: It is entirely what I wanted it to be. It is 100% Three Kings Cathedral Blend Resin, boswellia papyrifera, commiphora myrrha and boswellia sacra. The smell of a Catholic Church on the nose. I like incense fragrances, but this is the best in terms of quality of smell. It doesn't have great longevity honestly, for what it is you hope and expect it will last for a long time but it is a skin scent within a few hours. The projection is fine, I think it's quite tame but appropriate. Honestly I am gonna have to get a bottle, I just am really stunned by how beautifully accurate it is. I personally would perfume myself with church incense everyday and now I can. 8/10"", 'Spot-on Catholic church frankincense and myrrh. Smells just like the thurible smoke during Benediction.

Extract the holiness from church, leave the dull and boring behind (basically the priest and the structure) and you're in Avignion. This is pure art. 9/10"", 'Finally. I have been on the hunt for Avignon for several years. Where I‚Äôm from it was hard to get hold of. Gradually, I got my bottle of Zagorsk (which is beautiful scent in its own right) from the branded boutique, but already settled on the idea that I will never own Avignon as they claimed it discontinued. When I discovered a bottle on one beauty server, I snatched it immediately. And boy - as incense lover, I say - this is it: ultimate churchy incense - without any further adjectives. This is the smell of catholic church, period. I would not call it sweet or dry, it is just intricately authentic to what you expect to smell (and if you are like me you also look forward to it) when you sit down the church aisle during Holy mass. Very different from Casbah (quite green, spicy and piny) or even Cardinal (linen note makes it somber, almost macabre for me - it smells like a funeral gown or maybe priest robe - both pretty kinky connotations). Get it while you can - it is the reference incense, a must-have in any collection. Projection and longevity are not virtues of this CdG line, yet this is intimate perfume, contemplative piece that you wear for your own pleasure, not to impress others (unless you‚Äôre into priest/sinner confession role play or dress as Exorcist during Halloween).', 'Sweet and heavy, predominantly myrrh. This reminds me of Protestant churches more than traditional Catholic Cathedrals. It sort of holds back with a Puritan sensibility. It‚Äôs relatively dry and simple. There is no additional embellishment.  There is a subtle smoky incense in the background. Some vague floral sweetness.  It‚Äôs pleasant but if Myrrh is your preferred note then surely YSL Opium covers that base.  Avignon veres feminine in my opinion.  I think they could have really created something amazing because the theme is lovely but its not for me. My brother said ‚Äúit smells like dusty old bookcases‚Äù.', 'I really appreciate the artistic part of Avignon. From creative point of view this is a piece of art. BUT.

I am intrigued by incense fragrances and I love the smell of incense at funerals and during High Holy Mass at the Roman Catholic Church. Given this and the many positive reviews here on Basenotes, I decided to give CDG ""Avignon"" a try...along with Etro Messe de Minuit. Despite my husband asking, ""Do you REALLY want to walk around all day smelling like a Catholic Church?""...I LIKE this fragrance a lot...I really do! I am not so sure that smelling like a church is such a bad thing-smile.  Yes, this fragrance totally, 1000% reminds me of the frankincense and myrhh, slightly floral aromas of the incense used during High Holy Mass. There are smoky, musty, musky, dark, mossy, fern-like notes with a wee-bit of vanilla along with incense throughout the duration of the scent. Something in the mid-notes and dry down make this scent a bit more harmonious with my chemistry than Messe de Minuit. I did sneeze after applying both Messe de Minuit and Avignon...but I think that goes with the territory...pretty strong opening notes! I like the idea of a fragrance that dares to be so different and unique. I like this scent a lot...not sure if I could love it...not sure I am ready for a full bottle at such $$$$$$!

Its stone exterior is crumbling. Still, you step inside, select a dusty pew, sit. You close your eyes, perhaps praying to your god or meditating in silence. The smells come to you now: the dampness of the stone walls, the cedar pews, and the frankincense, long ago burnt in a swinging thurible, that saturates it all. Once again, this becomes a sacred place.', ""Incense and Cedar. This has the sourness of Catholic incense but isn't nearly as cloying.

I‚Äôm on my second wearing, and i love it; a lightly sweet, smokey frankincense with spices and vanilla.  I don‚Äôt have longevity issues; for an EDT it‚Äôs impressive. I get 4 hours before it turns to a skin scent. For me, this seems like a transitional season scent (Fall or Spring) but I can also wear this in all seasons because of the low projection. Try it!', ""Thanks to a wonderful member via a swap, I am now a proud owner of this fragrance. It's been a top want of mine since I'm a big fan of Bertrand Duchaufour. I'm also a big fan of incense centric scents; Sahara Noir, Gothic II, Ambre Sultan, Cardinal, Vento nel Vento, etc. I think you get the point. What sets this apart from all of those is the calming, slightly soapy note of the chamomile. It's also a bit creamy and balances out the dry, smokyness of the fragrance. Considering what companies are charging for fragrances these days, under $100 for 50 ml of this masterpiece is a bargain in my book. I'm 4 hours into wearing and it's going the distance. I think I might have found my new signature fragrance, and I'm curious to see how this will wear in warmer temps. 10/10"", ""I much agree with the previous reviewer--true, holy smokes incense, a bit dry, dessicated, peppery.

Lovely. Wish it had more silage."", 'Gorgeous, glorious, rapturous and everything you could possibly want from an incense perfume.

The opening is absolutely distinctive with an intense explosion of severe frankincense and myrrh, almost harshing but incredibly fascinating. The catholic church effect is pushed to the limit and persists during the drydown while camomille provides an extra dose of mystery and warmness smoothing the general harshness. Cedarwood and Iso E Super are clearly remarkable throughout but they're never overdone. A meditative scent that surrounds you with its intense warmness and deep resinous allure. As a trendsetter, Avignon became one of the most imitated straight forward incenses of the last 10 years (Heeley's Cardinal, Mark Buxton's Around Midnight, Biehl's MB3, Montale's Full Incense).

I was also completely enthused by the idea of smelling like an old, damp cathedral somehow. Well, I thought this would be extremely experimental and basically unwearable, but turns out I feel very at home wearing this. It's almost as if it had some sort of protective aura, enveloping you in a cocoon of comfort. A scent that manages to be both mystical and alluring - I basically smell like a sexy church (apologies for the blasphemy) and I'm pretty ok with that."", ""Avignon has become the reference incense for fragrance enthusiasts, and its hard to deny that compositionally it is evocative of a thurible swaying amongst the devoted in a Catholic church. It is a bit more than that, though, as it has elements that make it more impressionistic, more a perfume than purely a novel incense facsimile. We are not talking Demeter here.  Chamomile in the top note through the heart, lends a certain ineffable quality that reminds of its use in Aromatics Elixir, soothing and almost imparting a 'pastoral' feel that contrasts with the stark, stony chill of the olibanum and elemi overdose. The top, with the coniferous, spiky Aldehyde C-12, also lend to this chill that is soon warmed as myrrh, labdanum and what I can detect as cistus (the oil from the leaves rather than the resin of the Cistus ladanifer). In spite of the Iso E Super that lifts everything, Avignon is to my nose impressively imbued with naturals. The mildest shade of animalic, dry vegetal ambrette musk in the base makes for a really comforting skin scent in the dry down.  I now realize that this will be in my collection as not merely as a reference, but a true joy to wear. The cold yields to warm throughout its development, making it not quite as linear as has been suggested by others, and it surely suits me to a T during this snowy day in New England."", 'Comme des Garcons Series 3 Incense Avignon, a fragrance I affectionately call Old Church. Pretty much what everybody has said, it smells like the incense at an old Catholic church. In other words, it smells awesome.  The longevity is 12+ hours and projection is huge. Every time I wear this, my wife can smell the incense from rooms away. Not a huge compliment magnet, but it will get notice. I do wear it to church and hear some people mention they must have had incense at an earlier service. Funny. 10 of 10.', ""Does church incense smell this... fake? I remember saving up for this for such a long time on an enthusiastic blind buy. I quite enjoy challenging scents and have many years' experience with real myrrh, frankincense, and benzoin. I'm sorry to say that Avignon didn't remind me of any of them. It was just a shrill, chemical cheesegrater to the nose. I've noticed negative reviews get very few balloons here on fragrantica -- but hopefully at least one person will benefit from my experience. In my research to discover why I hated what so many others enjoyed, I discovered it might be a genetic thing. I've heard response to ISO E Super is genetically determined, and my neurology just knee-jerk rejects it. If I may bring up a sensitive topic, ISO E Super, the base of this perfume, is a cause for concern beyond taste -- it is highly toxic to aquatic life, and it is biocumulative. I think it would be rather tragic if a person, in their quest for a spiritual beauty, befouled the water that gives us all life."", ""Compared to other frankincense-like perfumes I've sampled, Avignon is the weakest when it comes to sillage and longevity. That might not be a bad thing, since frankincense can be awfully sharp. I'm not sure I would want it at full blast anyway.

When I see olibanum, myrrh and incense as notes in a scent named ""Series 3: Incense"" I expect some serious incense. I really don\'t get that here. Yesterday I wore Moresque ""Aurum."" That myrrh note wears combat boots! This fragrance is incense for beginners with no experience with incense, because if you\'d experienced any truly incense-forward scents, you\'d find this very weak by comparison. Not ""churchy"" in any cathedral or temple I\'ve been in, unless they have a special mild incense for the childcare area.  Nearly every scent that uses this ""everything and the kitchen sink"" approach (15 notes employed here) you get something pleasant but very non-descript and underperforming. The only exception I\'ve found is Penhaligon\'s ""Sartorial"" with 24 notes. I\'m confident I could pick it out from Nabeel\'s ""Master Perfumer Series"" like ""Al Bashiq"", which employs 44 notes. It\'s almost universally a mistake to formulate a scent that way. Can anyone actually distinguish one Jacques Bogart ""Silver Scent"" from the others? This Comme des Garcons scent comes across to me like that. Doesn\'t take a master perfumer to dump in everything you have on the shelf.  This is certainly safe for any use because it\'s simply not that potent, and it\'s pleasant, but makes no lasting impression. It\'s a non-performer that fades away before lunch, doesn\'t draw any notice or compliments, and at $120 that\'s disappointing. Won\'t be a bottle buy for me.']"

Reminds me of a something between Declaration Parfum and Azemour by PdE, thicker and warmer than the former, less green and floral than the latter.  Nice bitter orange top, but I don't get the listed rose, but rather a intense anise-y cardamon. In fact, the official site lists pink pepper and cardamom as main notes. I do however get a damp woody nuance from the base, which is probably where the connection with Azemour comes from.  I do get instances of a bit of a rubbery sharpness, and prefer Azemour overall, because it feels more nuanced and radiant. Performance is a little better on this one, and there definitely is a darker more abrasive quality to it, setting it firmly in the masculine category for me.

Found the initial opening sharp, scratch that,.. (edit) upon returning, I found the opening damn pleasant (after two weeks of checking out mainstream fragrances that mostly have the opening of a nice smelling alcohol). In my third passing on this, I got a moment of licorice, probably from the note combo. As it dried down on my skin I get a distinct quality canned tomato vibe in the middle. Rose doesn\'t seem present, just a faint ""floral"" memory. After reading others reviews, I gave another spray in the air and do get a much more initial bright citrus opening, but far more fresh cut grass. After some time on my skin I do get a slight spice note like cumin or cardamom. Later it\'s a faint tomato vine vibe. Even while writing this, I don\'t feel I\'ve sprayed anything on. I don\'t use any scented soaps, so I think it just shows how much your own natural smell changes a fragrance. I like it more in the air than on me by far. Given it\'s price point a strong pass. Sample first. (11/15/22 Edit) Testing this blind after six-plus months I found the opening this time far more citrus on top of a balsamic cracked pepper and fresh green aroma. The resulting dry down remaining similar but not as bright. You can smell the influence of the rose, but don\'t necessarily identify it without suggestion. Relatively fresh and green with a hint of spice but the combo can be a bit funky at times. I like it this time around more than prior but longevity and tone keep me from more than that.', 'SO fresh and happy-vibes inducing. Such a gorgeous citrus which dries to a beautiful skin scent.

More natural smelling version of Terre d‚Äô Hermes Eau Tres Fresh. Very similar scent profile. The cedar and hay gives a slight cumin vibe, similar to Vetiver Extraordinaire.

BC is a citrus-herbal cologne-like scent that reminds me of Herm√®s in style and Atelier Cologne in structure (simple and cologne-like, but with greater performance and concentration). For me, BC conjures up the image of the Italian countryside in the summertime, complete with orange trees and horses. BC opens with a mouthwatering, photorealistic orange note. Zesty, juicy and tart, it smells just like the real thing. As it develops, the orange is joined by herbal, grassy notes, before softening into the background. The hay note is a great addition - it really complements the other notes and adds warmth. I only get the merest hint of rose, and some soft spiciness. It becomes woodier as it dries down, fading to nothing within two hours.  Unisex but masculine-leaning in my opinion, BC is a simple yet high quality cologne with some points of interest. It feels like an Herm√®s scent - I get similarities to Eau d'Orange Verte and something akin to Terre d'Herm√®s too - but as Jean-Claude Ellena created these and more as Herm√®s in-house perfumer, maybe it's to be expected.

I knew nothing about perfume at the time, and the sales associate sprayed this for me after I mentioned that I liked citrus. It was fantastic - the orange was super fresh without being sweet, and was backed up by a great earthiness and warmth from the hay and cedar. The citrus is bitter yes, but definitely not tart; so fortunately it did not smell like any kind of cleaning product. A cozy earthy orange, where the warm base supports but does not overpower the bright top. Very unisex and approachable, and ultra sophisticated without being formal at all.  I still have that old bottle, and as it is running low, picked up a newer one recently; yep it's changed. Whether due to time or reformulation or both, there are subtle but distinct differences. 2012: opening is bright and bitter, but not sour, orange; almost greener at the opening in comparison to the newer bottle. The warmth from the hay and cedar is present and comforting, while the bitter orange hangs out on top for a pretty decent amount of time. Longevity isn't insane (especially not now in the winter), but is still pretty good IMO.  2021 bottle: opening is definitely sharper. The earthy warmth is less present initially, but after a little time, the overall profile gets mellow and hazy in a way that the older bottle doesn't. There's almost a powdery feeling to it (perhaps the rose?), and I don't really get the hay. There's still some wood at the base, but it's less distinct to me. The citrus is there as it dries down, but it's cocooned, and gets a bit softer and a tiny bit sweeter as time goes on. Doesn't stay as distinctly citrus nearly as long as the older bottle.  Overall I do like both, but I absolutely do prefer the older one. The powder I pick up in the newer bottle is a bit disappointing, and the pure bitter orange note sticks around better in the older bottle.

Which is agonising, because the first burst is just stunning: daringly sharp, nearly bitter, hedged around with beautiful green notes, and yes, unmistakably, a strong shake of cardamom magic dust helping to round it all out even more. And yes, again, its mix of orange and greens does evoke the classic Concentre d'Orange Vert, but simply better, to my nose: more upscale and niche and interesting all over. Just sheer, sharp, sparkling and gorgeous. Bracingly clean, uncompromising, minimal yet beautiful. It captures the sheer joy of orange more faithfully than almost anything I've ever smelled; the only things fit to get near it are Hermes C d'O Verte or Boucheron Orange de Bahia, so you see this Bigarade is not for cheapskates or those who like their oranges sweet.  But it's only really smellable for the first hour or so; faint heavenly whiffs might escape from your shirt-neck for up to a couple of hours more, and it does leave a wonderful but too-discreet shadow of itself behind closer to the skin for maybe up to 4h if you've sprayed on with abandon at first. At Malle prices ... eeeesh ... that's a big ask, although I find its searing zesty initial attack one of the most wonderful smells in the whole wide world.  Even spraying LOADS on will not make this evanescent beauty survive any longer - and God knows I've tried. You MUST try it. But try not to be bowled over by the first blast, don't lose your head, and go for a short walk, before committing to a buy. If your skin lets it live, there is no finer orange anywhere. But if not, then you'll be caught in the same terrible dilemma here as me. So great. But so infuriating at once! ETA: Guys, GUYS!! I have found just one way to stretch the beauty of this out a little longer - spray BIG, but getting most of it on your clothes. Still dies on skin far too fast, but if you get generous and properly mist your shirt /blouse/collar with it, you can eke out the lovely for up to 4-5h. It's still a big ask at Malle prices. But stuff this good deserves to be shown off to its best. Hermes Concentre for workaday use, Malle Bigarade for the special times."", ""Smells very much like Voyage D'Hermes EDT...citrus and cardamom. Surprised more people haven't mentioned it. Not surprising that it's the same perfumer. Was gonna say that the lack of creativity is disappointing, but it looks like VDH came out way later, so really, that's more like a poor man's BC. Usually, I find that the niche versions of designer frags are still worth the upcharge if you want a more refined version of a certain frag/accord/theme, but in this case, owning a full bottle of VDH already, I can't see ever laying out the cash for what's ostensibly the the extrait version."", 'The opening is very nice with juicy bitter orange that is paired with cumin and green notes. It goes to the classic eau de cologne style, but smelling contemporary, not dated. The smell is very satisfying but surely the cheaper alternatives like Hermes are just as good. 8/10', ""it has an amazing opening - really fresh burst of orange  then quickly becomes woody with lots of anise & dried hay  down side- it's a skin scent right off the bat and then fades after a couple hours to barely noticeable  i can't justify paying that much with such weak performance"", ""Gorgeous opening that resembles the process of peeling an grapefruit, just like what Guerlain Cologne Imperiale / Chanel Eau de Cologne do to an lime. They are on the same par, and finally a high-quality recomposition of Orange Verte has arrived. What's beneath is a hallmark green tea note that JCE loves to blend it in. The drydown seems weak compared with its opening, which reminds me of Dunhill Icon (a more JCE-ish iteration of Declaration), a bit sweet and synthetic to my taste. With so many decent and fairly priced citrus fragrances out there, I do not see much necessity to have this one. Rating: 6.5-7/10"", 'It opens with a beautiful sweet orange note and some hay, then comes the neroli (in a huge dose), and a little saffron. Oh my, this is divine. No big twists, it¬¥s a linear neroli perfume that stays the whole day in your skin - at least in mine. Bigarade concentree is a very good companion. Thank you, Ellena. Thank you, Frederic Malle.', ""This one is nice, but the opening and mid is a little too similar to Orange Verte, just more refined. Although the dry down takes a different turn, there's nothing that stands out to me to warrant a full bottle. Its a shame because the opening almost had me convinced this would be a replacement to Orange Verte, which by the way is 3X times cheaper."", 'It smells cumin with touch of citrus splash but very fresh and uplifting also. It reminds me of Declaration from Cartier which is created by same Perfumer, Ellena. Bigarade Concentree is really good perfume in my opninon and if you looking for something creative alternative for summer, you should go for this fragrance. Very good and somehow sexy!', ""The review below is one way of looking at it, some could gush about the subtlety of these perfume, neither position is right or wrong, meaning I shall remain firmly perched on the fence about Bigarade Concentree. It has the romantic simplicity of Ellena's compositions and his typical style is written all over this. Opens really lovely, with a wonderful orange note, juicy, zesty and green. It proceeds to get slightly more of a bitter orange feel it, then a very faint hint of cumin. Cedar is about the only other note I get, maybe some of that hay is what is creating the grassy/dry/spice of cumin? and coupled with the bitterness of the orange it's a really good combination. I love the smell of this perfume, however is it worth the pricetag and with poor lasting power? Not for me, but if you want the exclusivity of a JCE creation on FM's imprint rather than Hermes or similar then I get why you might want it. UPDATE: How bloody interesting hey? Look what I said above only in 2018? I own this now and I would say that Malle creations are something which stay with you, and make an impression even if it seems as though they didn't at first. I'm not sure why? Is it the careful curation and contrary to my closing comment (above) the fact that Malle gets the best out of his perfumers? I mean JCE has made plenty of citruses but this really is Iconic. I think my description above is pretty bloody spot on, If I do say so myself. I'd maybe say that the listed 'hay' note really comes into play in this and works so well. I love it."", ""It's ok... nothing that special. For the price, the performance and complexity isn't there."", ""A nice fragrance. Probably the nicest citrus fragrance I've smelled. That said, this is probably the most basic, plain, unsophisticated Frederic Malle perfume. It's not a typical citrus, in that the perfumer tries to have a green base for when the citrus burns away, but the green base is a single layer, rather than the multiple layers of other Malle perfumes.  The perfume does not last long - only a few hours, which makes the price extremely excessive. Furthermore, I wonder how short the cologne lasts is the concentree lasts only a few hours.  Overall, it's nice and pleasant, but simple and short."", ""Discovered Bigarade today, and, upon the first encounter and opening, it reminded me of Terre D'Herm√®s Tres Fraiche.  However, the comedown is vastly different: Bigarade settles into a warm, honey-like sweetness that's very ephemeral yet somehow equally persistent. Tres Fraiche, on the other hand, strikes with very heavy woody notes that often give me a headache if not worn at the right time (high humidity, too warm weather, etc.) Would love to add it to collection at some point, although the longevity somehow feels underwhelming. I can't tell whether this is the typical Ellena factor‚Äîwhen you can't sense the scent, but others around you can‚Äîso I'm hoping that I'll find a bottle at a price that is more suitable for a short-lived fragrance like this one.  That said, I really enjoyed it. Captivating and very lively."", 'Not too pretentious, yet not too simple. Good fine and elegant citrus and I really like the smell on the dry down nonetheless I expected more projection on it. Agree with the previous reviewers in the signature of Ellena on this one and similarity with other of his creations, but I like the Bigarade Concentrate a bit more. Price wise I don‚Äôt think is worth it only because of the performance, but I really love the scent.', 'One of the best citrus-forward fragrances I‚Äôve ever come across. Many orange-based scents go for the sickeningly-sweet approach via the orange blossom. This focuses on the aromatic rind; no blossoms, and never sweet. Instead, it‚Äôs warm and understated, with that ‚Äúsweat‚Äù note which this scent shares with D√©claration and which is always safe, never skanky. Love it. Basically, this is D√©claration with orange added. So obvious it was the same perfumer.  But alas, those two scents also share a common problem: no staying power. Perhaps things are now better with the new parfum version of D√©claration, but I doubt if Frederic Malle will ever release a more potent version of Bigarade. A shame, as this is a first-rate scent.', ""Fragrance -Bigarade Concentree Frederic Malle Bottle from - 2015 Bigarade Concentree is a transcendent,glowing,sparkling and  not made by humankind interpretation of orange with a bit juicy,crisp,bitter,natural,fresh and citrusy opening notes of bitter orange with a wisper of romantic rose.It's the feeling you get when you escape from the darkness of the night and find the joy of the early morning summer sun.Soon enough,soft and a bit skanky cumin comes into the game unsuccessfully trying to bring darkness into light.This all leads into a woody,green,creamy and a bit spicy base with soft,citrusy and moderatly bitter orange sneaking at the edges.In my opinion,this is one of the best orange based fragrance.

It is a citrus but sweet and dry/bitter at the same time. The hay, grass and rose combine to give it an odd quality with a vintage vibe.

Wouldn't want a full bottle or wear it regularly but definitely interesting to sniff."", 'One of the most perfectly orchestrated classic citrus colognes in my opinion. It\'s extremely simple but something about it stands out above many others that are similar. The citrus notes are bright and realistic but remain soft and warm while at the same time remaining fresh and sparkling.

This is a soul fragrance, perhaps it\'s the hay, but something about it gives me that relaxing feeling that you can only get out in the country, away from everything, and at one with nature.  I still haven\'t purchased a full bottle and I\'m not sure why. I think I found it too ""simple"" for the price. And it doesn\'t last very long, even the concentree. But basing it on nothing but scent alone, no other factors involved, for a citrus cologne I would rate it 10/10.', '6/10', 'A pale, juicy cologne in the classic style (ie. citrus). Top notes of freshly peeled orange with a soft powdery-ness from the rose. Seems like it would be excellent for hot, humid weather as it has Ellena\'s signature transparency lightness - it probably projects better in heat and humidity than in the cool air conditioning I\'m in right now. Fresh without being cold or ""aquatic"". After reading previous comments I realized what this reminds me of - Bvlgari\'s Eau Parfumee au The Vert, at least early on in the dry down. I definitely enjoyed it but I don\'t really get why it\'s so highly regarded. To each their own I guess.', 'Bigarade C. Ellena is a fragrance, has a clear link with Terre, especially flanker eau Fraiche three or Declaration. To Ellena, the privilege would always carry citrus and other fruit notes in partnership, the rest is not so important as it was happening to his master Roudniska, especially compared to male citrus type Eau Sauvage. In this case, bitter orange in ripe fruit version is attached to the note of a sharp and fresh grass privilege takes this combo produces that similar to lemon feel that you have been disenrolled excess acidity and is cleared very cleverly the cleaner, disinfectant and soap ground, falling thing most of this family of fragrances. He is accompanied by a mild note of very natural rose, which clarifies, illuminates and brings glamor, like those brush strokes watercolor gouache likes so much. Cedar drying hay is in third plane without relevance since it is only used to prolong the effect of fruit start and cause the solar effect on the fruit shriveled when dry. We are not facing ""Bois Farine,"" but the work of a great perfumer is not questioned.

It is not sweet, a bit dry, but still gloriously mood lifting. Trust me when I say this: For a citrus(notes include Bitter Orange, Rose, Hay and Cedar) this is a very complex fragrance, there is more going on that just taking the notes verbatim as we see them on paper. No run of the mill, linear citrus frag here- yet it us linear in certain aspects, but not as you\'d expect given the note composition........... The heart is well balanced and developed which is what one would expect from a frag resulting from the nose of Jean Claude Ellena! His DNA is all over this one and IMO, he takes it a step further in another later creation (which I\'ll touch on later). This fragrance has a lot of presence and staying power..... One KEY point: This is one of those VERY VERY RARE fragrances that actually smells BETTER as you you to-and-fro than it actually smells on your skin.......... The sillage is magnificent! Better put on your glasses frag community, because this is a 3D masterpiece........!  My only caveat is this: for those of you who NEVER put your nose to this- There\'s a soft cumin note that creeps in and out during the dry down... For some, this evokes memories of the jock older brother who has a morbid fear of the shower and finds it funny to stick his smelly armpits in your face after working out..... If that aspect of this fragrance scares you away - then don\'t even bother...., because some of you will have an aversion to this ""body-odour"" aspect of the frag..... The solution.... Please try by any means possible to get your hands on Bvlgari Eau Parfumee au The Vert Extreme....... It\'s EVERYTHING this is- less than controversial cumin note...

Rating: 8/10', 'Very realistic bitter orange (or in Asia preserved and salted orange/kum kwats). It only projects 2 hours on me though it will last more than 8 (when I shower I can easily smell it).  As such this probably will only be smelt in hot weather, only a summer fragrance or during humid days.... PV of 12.5% makes this and EDP.', ""Oh how I love this! It smells of pure citrusy orange and lemon to me, to the point it makes me crave a lemon to eat. I get no rose, no cedar, nothing but citrus in all it's glory. Unfortunately in 10 minutes I get nothing at all. Not the barest whiff left no matter how much or where I spray. This leaves me heartbroken."", ""Beautiful and pure fresh orange scent. I love it for 30 seconds and it's gone. Way too light a fragrance for me. Too bad, as my bottle is signed by Fredric Malle personally. It's a great fragrance for a lighter skin type do not want something imposing. Great for the office."", 'The sunlight glints on the waxen shell of the orange, and brings the fragrance experience which cannot be forged as gift for us. This is an explosion if I should characterize it with a sound. Unforgettable delicate citrous like that, succulent sweets manage to get into my reason from the fragrance, that feeling like this, Aqua Di Parma Arancia Di Capri-yeah caused at me last. The aroma of the fruity sweets spicy one, and the rose makes it unique him chortling, who constantly jabbers into the calmness of the seaside idyll.

Bigarade keeps his light, a fresh refreshment throughout his strength our start, a glow-worm calling some with his lamp in the night even glitter.', ""I've just tried Bigarade Concentree on my wrist and it smells exactly as my hand used to smell after peeling an orange. It has got that bitter orange zest smell in the top notes. Cedar and even more grass form the base of the scent but never at any point is the orange lost.  Bigarade Concentree is masculine enough for any man.  To me, oranges are particularly attached to christmas, so I'd wear it as a cozy winter scent."", 'I never thought that I could like a citrus based scent; but I guess you have to test one that is masterfully blended, like Bigarade concentree! Rich citrus is the key to this scent being wearable to me, I would not like it if it screamed ""I am Orange!"" No, this scent says calmly and confidently ""I am nature and I am succulent."" I imagine orange slices left to warm in the sun, then savored in late afternoon while sitting among tall grass with your back against a tree. The more I sniff, the more I appreciate and admire this scent. Not for everyone, Definitely has the ""cologne"" thing about it that Veruska mentioned and it would be considered too ""manly"" for some. I don\'t subscribe to those barriers, and feel quite confident and unapologetic about loving this scent!', 'I concur with everything veruska says. I feel like I am in the minority. Just adore this along with the Cologne. It is in my top 5 fragrances and nothing comes close.', ""This is one of the first niches that i ever had and a summer staple that i just can't be without.The bitter orange that sings cologne with heavy french accent, the rose that never leads to feminine paths but give a simmering beauty and the fantastic grounded( for a cologne) cedar ending conclude in perfection. I find it very strange that nobody else reviewed that, one of J.C. Ellena's undiscovered masterpieces. I take a bow!"", ""It's 2009. I am a little boy at a sleepover at my grandparents' house. I wake up to the songs of Laughing Doves who've made a nest in the corner of our balcony. It's a brisk morning in May and a pleasant breeze flows through my open window, tickling my feet. I can hear the distant chatter of my grandparents having breakfast in the terrace. The thought of fried eggs with persian sangak bread has my stomach rumbling so I jump out of bed to indulge. As soon as my breakfast finishes I ask my grandfather to take me to the park and play football with me. He smiles and tells me to get dressed. As we're about to leave, my grandmother runs to the yard with a basket of citruses she picked from the trees in her garden. I smell the basket. This is that scent. It's 2021, I traveled back to Iran to visit friends and family. I sat by the gravestone of both my grandparents. I called my uncle, who's been taking care of the house, and asked him to bring the keys to it. He unlocked the door and I walked into the front yard where I got soaked many times while commandeering the water hose that we'd use to water the plants. I walked through the rooms where I used to play hide and seek, past the empty shelves that were once filled with my grandfather's books, and finally reach the garden. I saw the orange trees, still standing tall. I reached for a fruit and cut it open with a knife. I first smelled the orange, and then my hands. The scent was just as I remembered it. This is that scent."", 'I\'m usually not into citrus fragrances but This one is a standout. The opening is absolutely amazing with a ""desweetened-candied"" orange note that is one of the best around joined in a while by a moderate rose note reinforcing the scent and giving it some complexity and depth.

Rating: 8/10', 'UPDATE: having purchased and worn it for over a week, I have an enlightened take on this frag: Jean Claude Ellena\'s use of the Seville bitter Orange extract is like NOTHING you\'ve ever experienced: The opening of BC is fresh and life-like, right away you pick up the bitterness- which is altogether expected considering it\'s NOT blood oranges we\'re dealing with as with Atelier, Le Labo or other houses. It is not sweet, a bit dry, but still gloriously mood lifting. Trust me when I say this: For a citrus(notes include Bitter Orange, Rose, Hay and Cedar) this is a very complex fragrance, there is more going on that just taking the notes verbatim as we see them on paper. No run of the mill, linear citrus frag here- yet it us linear in certain aspects, but not as you\'d expect given the note composition........... The heart is well balanced and developed which is what one would expect from a frag resulting from the nose of Jean Claude Ellena! His DNA is all over this one and IMO, he takes it a step further in another later creation (which I\'ll touch on later). This fragrance has a lot of presence and staying power..... One KEY point: This is one of those VERY VERY RARE fragrances that actually smells BETTER as you you to-and-fro than it actually smells on your skin.......... The sillage is magnificent! Better put on your glasses frag community, because this is a 3D masterpiece........!  My only caveat is this: for those of you who NEVER put your nose to this- There\'s a soft cumin note that creeps in and out during the dry down... For some, this evokes memories of the jock older brother who has a morbid fear of the shower and finds it funny to stick his smelly armpits in your face after working out..... If that aspect of this fragrance scares you away - then don\'t even bother...., because some of you will have an aversion to this ""body-odour"" aspect of the frag..... The solution.... Please try by any means possible to get your hands on Bvlgari Eau Parfumee au The Vert Extreme....... It\'s EVERYTHING this is- less than controversial cumin note... He substituted it for coriander I believe and it\'s a much mire palatable note- IMO...', 'It takes incredible restraint to remain civilized around this scent - I want to roll around in it like a dog on a particularly compelling patch of lawn. I NEED this smell on me. Bright, bitter, spicy, salty, funky. Lime peel rubbed over sweaty armpits in the best, most addictive way possible.', 'Is there a cheaper alternative to this? It‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous but outrageously expensive for what it is.', ""Beautiful and pure fresh orange scent. I love it for 30 seconds and it's gone. Way too light a fragrance for me.

Great for the office."", ""Just a sour, pungent armpit note. That‚Äôs all. It's horrible"", ""A very weird, unique citrus. It is a citrus but sweet and dry/bitter at the same time. The hay, grass and rose combine to give it an odd quality with a vintage vibe. It's not trying to be Shalimar but is that kind of classic weird citrus frag. Not floral is projecting. Interesting. Wouldn't want a full bottle or wear it regularly but definitely interesting to sniff."", 'A friend had given me a decant of Cologne Bigarade because it didn‚Äôt suit them.

Then, somewhere along the line, I had read that this was basically the same fragrance, only stronger. ‚ÄúHow wonderful!‚Äù I thought to myself. And on paper (like, when sprayed on literal paper) yes, it is exactly that. Really lovely!

But when my skin is thrown in the mix‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, man‚Ä¶ there is something in there that is absolutely wretched on me. There‚Äôs just like, a *tinge* of something that‚Äôs gone off, or B.O., or even like‚Ä¶ something ever-so-slightly wet-diaper-adjacent. An undercurrent of something very rank. I dunno. Maybe it was just me? Maybe I just smell? Maybe I got a bad bottle (is that a real thing?)? It‚Äôs expensive and this kind of fragrance is usual enough that I‚Äôm willing to just cut my losses, but yeah, kind of a bummer!', ""All I can smell is the caraway which gives me the body odor smell.

I discovered the champaca flower on a trip in Indonesia (they use it a lot for offerings and also for massage oils, incense etc.) and completely fell in love with that flower smell. I was hoping to find that same sweet, almost honeyed nectar smell but this perfume is actually really green. I would agree with some reviews and say it‚Äôs a green fresh floral perfume. It‚Äôs soft and not offensive, but not what I was looking for, it‚Äôs missing some punch and some sweetness in my opinion. I‚Äôm not a big freshie girl, and even tho I still find it soft and clean-shampoo smelling ( I think it could work for some occasion where you want to smell fresh and feminine), the longevity and sillage are not great so I don‚Äôt think it is worth it.', ""I really don't like it on me. When I test it, I can smell sth very fresh, peppery and citrusy. Little do I smell any flower. For me it's like a cleaning product and it gives me a headache. Do not recommend buying without testing."", 'Ormonde Jayne Champaca is a light, sheer scent based around the tropical white flower known as Magnolia champaca, said to be the tree under which the Buddha achieved enlightenment. The flower has a swoony, tropical, narcotic, almost fruity scent, but here it‚Äôs treated in an ethereally fresh and subtle manner, with clean green notes in the opening, and a dry green-tea background hum, as well as some milky toasted rice in the heart. This is actually as much a rice scent as a champaca scent. It makes me think of a shady tropical verandah. Deep in the drydown there‚Äôs a spiced, sticky note that I assume is the myrrh, making this into a mild floral-rice-pudding dessert. It‚Äôs all very polite, and I can usually take my white florals quite a bit bolder than this; I‚Äôd love to try a full-bodied, epic champaca fragrance sometime, with all the nectar-dripping indoles intact. But I can‚Äôt really call Ormonde Jayne Champaca ‚Äúboring‚Äù either. The sticky rice note is unusual, as is the green tea; there are no cliches here. This would make a really great bridal fragrance, I think. White florals have the kind of lush femininity that goes well with the one day in your life you‚Äôll wear a poofy dress, but this one is light and transparent enough not to offend a crowd of guests.', 'I tested this in a perfume boutique without looking at the notes first. I had no idea what champaca was at the time. It smells really fresh and clean and has a wonderful balance between green and slightly floral. I should have known when I fell in love with it that it also has a tea note, because that seems to be my favorite lately. This is absolutely full bottle worthy and I will be reaching for it a lot this spring.', ""8/10 i consider this more freshie than floral, which i love. if i was to put the accords on fragrantica from my perception - it would fresh, then maybe green (bamboo, tea, and neroli feel green to me), then floral i love freshies but a lot of the notes used in them can be super screechy and headache inducing to me. i feel like this is the first freshie to actually work for me completely! this one feels very natural, and gentle.. and its also so feminine without the typical sweetness or fruitiness you might expect from a feminine fragrance. its refreshing without being citrusy, or bracing but if you're trying this for the first time - make sure to let it dry down. because with the neroli and pink pepper in the opening, it was too sharp and spicy for me. but after about 5 mins, that faded and the gentler notes started to appear.  the tea and rice note really make it stand apart. i often find tea notes to be too bitter - this is not! just fresh and gentle. forgive me for using the same words over and over  i think the rice is what helps to round this out, and smooth any harsh edges that you also sometimes find in freshies.  i was surprised to see moderate longevity and sillage in the votes on here. for me so far the performance has been pretty poor, but i dont mind because i love the scent. it turns into a skin scent on me after an hour or so. if i want to smell it on myself without putting my nose to my wrist, i just re-spray throughout the day every few hours"", 'Blind bought a while ago and I had no idea what to expect. I have to say, the more I wear it the more I like it. It‚Äôs fresh without being citrusy. It‚Äôs like a smooth, elegant freshie and I really like the rice note. Makes it more unique.

While I definitely like it, my tastes run more toward more perfume-y perfumes, in general, and if I'm in the mood for a fresh, shampooey scent, I'd just as soon wear CK Truth or the slightly more perfumey EA 5th Avenue, both of which are incredible bargains, to boot."", ""Save yourself about $250 and buy yourself a bottle of Elizabeth Arden Green Tea.

I feel like this one is kind of in that family, that light sparkling style of pretty and inoffensive scent.', 'Just recieved mine and I have to say this is stunning. It opens up warm, a tad green (due to the bamboo), spicy and fruity. Suits the summer season perfectly.

Has the screechy freesia note from Lanc√¥me's Miracle combined w/ Champaca and green and spicy notes. Very strange combination and not a true pretty floral. This is a unisex floral, very unisex actually leans masculine. Why can't Niche companies make real feminine floral perfumes? Even the perfumes I like from this brand lean unisex. All except Frangipani. If you want a pretty champaca floral that will not let you down and really smells like champaca but has a sweetness of nicely balanced fruity notes and a pretty lactonic and soft spicy dry down, try Jean Patou's Sira des Indes.

Initially I get a wonderful hit of champaca and neroli, which rapidly dissipates into a vague powdery scent (rice and freesia, I assume). After several hours I begin to get whiffs of champaca again. Unfortunately, the bitter and spicy elements I love in this perfume don't even linger as a skin scent - I have to shove my nose into the clothes I'm wearing to get any of the tea or myrrh.

I highly doubt anyone else in the building will be wearing it when I do! I have family members that can be overwhelmed by scents/perfume but this does not bother them. This is one of the few perfumes I own that truly feel like they can be worn year round, day or night.

Basenotes are soft, a little sweet and a touch fruity, which I didn\'t expect. I thought I wasn\'t going to like the musk/myrrh/tea base, but this is really quite nice. It has a smooth quality similar to sandlewood, but a bit sweeter. As florals go, this seems fairly unisex. And on me it does not warrant either the ""sweet"" note or the ""amber"" note in its pyramid.', ""At first wearing of my little sample, I swear I could not smell it on my skin. I had applied unscented lotion after my shower, so perhaps the lotion absorbed it? On second try, with no lotion, I could detect it and it is fantastic! Fresh, green, woody, spicy. In the drydown it gets a little sweeter and more floral. It's a very light, uplifting and comforting fragrance. Could wear this anywhere, anytime. But the longevity is pretty weak- 4 hours later and it's all but gone. If it lasted longer this would be absolutely signature worthy."", '""I was made for lovin\' you, baby You were made for lovin\' me And I can\'t get enough of you, baby Can you get enough of me?"" Geza... You deserve every hype, delicacy of your fragrances lighten up my days... Before fall starts i will cheerish this beauty. Notes are not enough to describe how captivating this perfume is.  Just. Get. It.  You won\'t regret.', 'This is a beautiful summer floral. As it dries its not cloying like I find so many white florals. It\'s creamy, slightly citric and bright. I think the rice note smooths the edges. My nose can\'t really pick the notes apart, it almost smells watery and fresh but it doesn\'t cross the line like you would expect others in that category to smell. I read other reviews below calling this ""generic"" and not very remarkable, don\'t let those influence your choice to try this. Its delightful. I find it extraordinary, I don\'t find many florals I can\'t live without. I find most florals, especially white florals too loud and screechy, that is not the case here. Even though it\'s an eau de parfum, this scent on my skin pulls in close after first 1/2 hour and stays there for 4-6 hrs. It is a bit pricey but I bought the biggest bottle so that I may reapply at my leisure.  On a side note, I was on a quest to find a gardenia scent I could enjoy. And although most say they smell nothing alike, my mind and nose is satiated currently. This is a beautiful scent. Addendum: I\'ve been wearing this more frequently since obtaining a full bottle and I was wrong about longevity. It lasts at least 8 hrs easy, wafting in and out and on textiles it lasts for days. I sprayed this on a shirt Sat and the following Wed can still smell it strongly. It\'s softly projects and leaves a wonderful trail.  One of the very few scents I\'ve gotten compliments from.  Beautiful summer breeze type of scent. I\'m so in love with it.', ""Sharp green and pepper to start. Then becomes more gently bright and floral. Settles in mildly floral and green and mildly dusty/musky. Sometimes I get a vaguely soapy whiff, maybe from the white flowers. It's well made, as expected with OJ, but it just made me want to dive back into the rich woody forest of OJ Woman. Relatively this is a bamboo forest - bright green on top and musty and pale brown and green on the bottom - with little white flowers and a clean stream of water running through it. Beautiful and it achieves what it is trying to do, without being dull. It's just not my favorite scene."", ""Ormonde Jayne's are outstanding; you must recognize that they're so well constructed and so well blended, that you can even justify the steepy price for those fabulous little bottles.  That said, Champaca is not my favourite of the line (so far, this prize belongs to Tolu & Tai'f and second best, Woman) but without doubt this is a masterfully done floral. Quite prominent on the initial notes (read: it is strong), I can smell white flowers, orange blossom, Jasmine and Champaca, Tiar√©, Magnolia - while I do not get neither the basmati rice nor the green tea notes.  Probably the flowers are a bit overpowering... The base is resinous and musky.  It has a better staying power than the other frags in the line.  As I said it is not my favourite, but it is surely an unusual floral that deserves to be tried at least once."", ""Too much freesia for me. Champaca OJ smells fresh, floral and perfumey. It's a woman's spring floral. I can see this smelling amazing on other people. Not for me though. -"", ""Champaca is my favorite of all I tried from OJ range. I especially enjoy the rice note in it. In 2013 I got the Signature sample set and back then I didn't pay too much attention to that one. I preferred Tiare, this year though, I just wanted to revisit some of the scents and try a few new ones. So I got one of the 8ml Travel Lab sets, Champaca was among the ones I wanted to revisit and turned out to be one of those 'Me in a bottle' scents. FB will be purchased when I have first occasion to treat myself.  Champaca is flowery/spicy/rice-y fragrance which stays absolutely divine on my skin from top to bottom. Love!"", ""This is not a bad fragrance at all, but it is much more green to my nose than floral. It reminds me of Truth by Calvin Klein, but the Ormonde Jayne is more beautiful and complex. I received this as a gift, but I don't think I'd buy this unless it was discounted. I do enjoy it, though."", ""Champaca is head and shoulders above the smellalikes listed, but it's fair to say it does share similarities with some of the shampooey, fruity, ozonic fragrances from the early 00s, at least in its dry down. It's very nostalgic for anyone who discovered fragrance for the first time in the late 90s, like I did. It specifically smells like something I wore to school, which had a pearly bronze plastic cap and was in a round bottle, and cost about a tenner from Boots.  However, it's done very well. Incredibly balanced, with a delicious fruity heart and a pleasing halo of soapy, clean white florals. This is a very beautiful scent - definitely on the feminine side - which would suit a Gen-Z barefooted bohemian in white cotton as much as an older CEO or TV presenter.  I enjoy the fact Ormonde Jayne florals are so wearable. Yes, they are expensive, but often I shell out on a niche fragrance that in the end is a bit too odd, quirky or difficult to wear often."", 'I have three perfumes with champaca in them, and they are all unique: I Miss Violet by The Different Company, Sira des Indes by Jean Patou and Champaca Absolute from Tom Ford. I have travelled through India and parts of Souteast Asia where champaca is native, but am unaware if I have ever come into contact with the real thing, though I am sure I have. In perfume, champaca has this distinctive buttery, waxy smell to me, and it‚Äôs lightly spicy. Each of the perfumes mentioned above uses champaca in interesting ways. Unfortunately Champaca by Ormonde Jayne is the least inspired of the perfumes I have tried with champaca. I can pick out champaca, and it‚Äôs blended well so that nothing else is obvious, but I don‚Äôt care for it. There‚Äôs nothing exotic or intoxicating in this blend, and I don‚Äôt have an answer as to why.  Not a down vote but it is a pass.', ""Perfectly good treatment of the note - but IMHO not as inspired or as lovely as many others from Ormonde Jayne, and some of its other white/yellow flower scents (Frangipani, Sampaquita) seem a bit more ebullient and special to me than this one. Champaca can be seriously strong - even overpowering - but while the usual OJ seasoning of pink pepper and extra notes does calm things down, and keep the whole mix from cloying, it somehow doesn't get all the way to the opulence I'd expect for OJ prices. For me, for once, this treatment is less long-lasting and a little less impressive than CDG's Luxe Champaca. Really down to skin scent only in only 2 or 3 hours and only the most discreet whiff of loveliness thereafter. Still borderline unisex, but about as femme as OJ scents really get. So not out of this world, but then, a mediocre Ormonde Jayne is still more excellent than many other houses' top-of-their-game winners. Polite applause, but not a wild screaming fan club, for this one I think. ETA on another wearing on a crisp cold day: no, I was wrong - this is great! Really strong, convincing pepperiness makes it both richer and pricklier, more exciting, than many an over-sweet go at the note - the bamboo and tea also coming across more clearly. Still not the very top of the house's game but really intriguingly spicy, teasingly herbal, and convincing throughout. Longevity also stretched a bit further in the cold, oddly - going pretty strong for 4-6h."", 'A beautiful and delicate fragrance. Such a shame that it is so fleeting on me. Within a couple hours it is gone entirely.', 'This is a lovely perfume but not OJs best. I think I would have been more excited about it had it not smelled exactly Lubin Jardin Rouge.', ""Disappointing.  It smells like a wrapped paper grocery bag with lemons, orange, tea bags and wafer bars inside. You know - paper, wafers, tea and lemons mixed together. Very long lasting.  It bears some resemblance to Eau De Rubylips. I don't know champaca's fragrance, but once I had champaca essential oil and it was very very similar to Truth by C.Klein (wax-y green, tea like, masculine). And Champaca by Ormond Jayne is more kitchen-type of scent."", ""I used to grow Michelia champaca before I moved, but I didn't care for the fragrance of the yellow flowers as it was very strong. This perfume smells nothing like it and is soft and lovely. I currently grow the white flowered version, Michelia x alba, which is a amazing fragrance, which I would love to see captured in a perfume. This is nice but not full bottle worthy to me. The longevity isn't great as I could barely smell anything on my skin a couple of hours after applying."", ""This has an awesome scent like true to life daffodils. I suppose champaca smells like that. It smells like you're smelling the flower itself. However, sillage is weak while longevity is only moderate. Also, it leans very feminine. 3.5/5"", ""I am surprised at the negative reviews. This is hands down my favorite perfume and I could just bathe in it...It is a unique combination of fragrance that I have never smelled anywhere else before. Also, I am very sensitive to most popular commercial perfumes and sharp smells, and get headaches easily, which means I can't wear most perfumes for more than an hour. This one is just divine. It has a warm, creamy, well rounded floral / fruity feel, with a fresh scent of pepper / bamboo thrown in somewhere to pep things up, but is definitely not too sweet or cloying. It is a bit of a warmer, heavier perfume for me, so I tend to wear it in the winter or in the evenings. Sophisticated, layered, lasts a long time.  Other perfumes I enjoy and can tolerate are Il Bacio by Borghese, Chloe (though the powdery finish is a little too old for me) and my day to day favorite, Versace Pour Femme - which is also a warm rounded fruity floral, but on the lighter, elegant side, so I wear that to work."", ""This is a calming, comfort scent to me and I truly love it and douse myself in it on hot days. Primarily it smells like a toasted nutty rice tea, with a citrus twist. The floral aspects don't really stand out to me on their own, but may act more as a watery floral tea essence. It's soft and light but lasts quite a long time on my skin. I'm so curious about the Cacharel Noa Perle now! Too bad it was discontinued because I'd blind buy it just to compare."", ""Don't believe the votes; it's more like a (bamboo heavy) minty tea."", 'Champaca has been my go to scent for a very long time. This perfume suits all occasions. Somehow this manages to be mildly sweet, but green and refreshing floral with good lasting power. I love this and also Frangipani from the OJ line.', ""Agree with other reviewers who have noted this as a safe scent. I don't find safe to be disagreeable though. I love this one for springtime, and quiet or low-key events like a friend of a friend's house party or memorial service. Something were I want to wear scent, and want to keep it light, pretty and unique. I haven't smelled much else like it. I find it to be one of the more ethereal fragrances in my collection.  I do agree that the pink pepper can be intense, but I have not experienced this every time, just once when I wore it to work (maybe it had strange interference with the HVAC system? who knows with these things!)."", 'I love champaca, frangipani and ylang ylang but these are demanding, loud hothouse divas that need to be handled with care. I think I can say with some confidence that this exists here in OJs olfactory translation of this potent note. The myrrh and tea really compliment this diva by taming her with a touch of smokiness and dryness so she doesnt holler too loudly. Once again pepper, neroli and freesia add the pepperiness the act like accents to this three dominating notes. Towards the end the myrhh and tea stay to the end of the performance. Its very nice but again weak like many of the OJs creations on me.', ""I've had a 10 ml decant that has lasted forever because it never made me want to reach for it. It's nice. That's about it. I want something that I want to waft every once in awhile...that I adore. This isn't it."", 'I bought 5 samples from Oromonde Jayne and this is my least favourite of them. It\'s not an unpleasant perfume - in fact it\'s very nice - but it\'s just so boring. I struggled to have any kind of reaction to it at all.  It opens with a blast of pink pepper, then it becomes a fruity floral with a nice touch of bamboo. It\'s hard to say what the florals really are. It\'s more just an approximation of ""floral"", like you get in many mainstream perfumes.  The bamboo is nice, it offers a lovely greenness to the composition.  I can\'t say I really get anything in the way of champaca or freesia. To me, this is orange, pepper, \'floral\' and a hint of bamboo.  It\'s nice, it\'s safe and it\'s not in any danger of offending anyone, but it smells like every other mainstream fruity floral out there, except it costs twice as much.  It\'s a great crowd pleaser, it would make a great celebrity perfume. And I\'m not saying there\'s anything wrong with that because there isn\'t at all. It\'s just the price that\'s the problem. Niche comes with an unspoken promise of something a bit different. We\'re told we\'re paying for the higher quality ingredients, and that may be true (but let\'s face it, often isn\'t), but what we\'re really shelling out for is to not smell like everyone else. We want something a bit different to what\'s readily available from mainstream perfumes. This fails to offer that.  Soft sillage and 8 hours longevity.  Perfectly nice, but you could easily find something that does the same thing at half the price.', ""First, I must admit that I know nothing about the scent of champaca- but one thing is for sure-someone used a really heavy hand with the pink pepper shaker on this one- to the point where any easily discernible floral notes are almost completely obliterated- although I think I smell some freesia, maybe...  I get some sour citrus notes here, too- reminiscent of Serge Lutens' Nuit de Cellophane Fortunately, the scent softens a little as it enters the heart phase, and the longevity is admirable for a niche scent"", ""CHAMPACA = ECLAT D'ARPAGE (Lanvin) + PEPPER + NUTMEG?? Upon first spray, i was immediately reminded of Eclat d'Arpege. You know, that creamy & crisp sweet lilac + green tea combo. This impression lasts for about 5 minutes then i get a whiff of bright sparkling pink pepper. Then I detect a sweet jammy pear with nutmeg and soft incense notes. At one point in time I get a really beautiful orange blossom note peeking through, but not quite strong enough to throw off the sweetness. One hour later I get fresh figs, soft suede leather, peppercorn and stewed fruit. At this stage it reminds me of a fruity pipe tobacco (perhaps my favourite part of this perfume, unfortunately this phase is rarther short-lived). The changes are subtle and the perfume stays linear and close to the skin. The main theme is a slightly spiced Eclat d'Arpege. CHAMPACA is very soft and never harsh, with average longevity and low sillage. It is not bad but certainly isn't FB worthy. While being finely balanced, it lacks the inspiring and intriguing qualities which are often expected from niche perfumes."", 'Doc Elly called it, ""the elevator music of the perfume world.""

It ends up smelling like a soft-spoken distant cousin of D&G Light Blue.', 'My first impression was that this is strongly floral, with a lot of commercial-smelling fruity-floral sillage, not far removed from the standard celebrity scent. I did notice an odd note, more like a gap in the florals than a note per se, so this may have been the rice and/or bamboo accords that are reputed to be in the fragrance.  I put it on, got busy with things, and completely forgot about it. By the time I remembered that I had it on, it was more or less gone, so the only thing I can say is that, to me, it‚Äôs a not very memorable floral that only lasts a few hours - the perfume equivalent of elevator music. If you‚Äôre looking for a floral scent that‚Äôs not obtrusive, this might be just the thing.', ""Champaca is absolutely gorgeous. Beautiful, waxy yellow flowers weave throughout from top to base. Waxy, yes... I get the association with soap. Freshly floral and clean.

Feminine, natural and endearing."", ""Sherapop wrote about her experience with champaca soap, and I cannot get around the soapy effect of this fragrance. It reminds me of a fresh, green, tea-infused soap in the opening. Very expensive. Very rich. Yet very relaxed and natural. The slightest whiff of powder turns up midway, mingling with a sultry floral. The fragrance actually seems to change on me, becoming warmer and earthier, even a bit smoky. It's comforting and beautiful, but for whatever reason, it does not awe me. It smells faintly of something else, but I cannot put my finger on it."", 'My primary experience with champaca has been in the form of extremely potent soaps with which I was scenting my drawers (some of them may still be there, but the smell no longer wafts up everytime I walk by!) Given this experience, I donned Ormonde Jayne CHAMPACA expecting a pretty hard-hitting oriental perfume. Instead, what I have found is a soft, creamy, light floriental with a perfect dose of champaca on initial application. CHAMPACA opens beautifully with a scrumptious melange of creamy rice, light champaca and green tea. I would adore this perfume if only this stage lasted. Alas, it fades all too quickly, leaving behind only the faintest layer after an hour or so. The composition is truly gorgeous but all too shortlived... It would be nice to try this creation in perfume concentration.', ""I was so excited to try this as I LOVE Champaca. The Ormonde Jayne store is SO hard to find too but I did hehe. This is slightly underwhelming for me. It's slightly spicy to me, in the way that carnation is spicy. This has that spicy/floral this going on. It's also fresh and slightly masculine, bit of a weird one and I wouldn't say..beautiful..it's spiky!  I was hoping for something more complex than this as this was the first Ormonde Jayne scent I've smelled.
