Not worth the price for sure', 'Starting to think Clive Christian should stick to making fresh fragrances. 1872 Masculine is yet another excellent citrus-aromatic-woody fragrance from this house. The initial whiff of bright and juicy citruses rounded out with spices like nutmeg immediately made me think of Aventus Absolu. Not that they\'re similar at all, but the way this scent is ""constructed"" so to speak reminded me of the Creed. As the scent dries down it becomes more aromatic, but the citruses are still pretty present. It\'s an extremely likeable and easy to wear fragrance, and it\'s also blended excellently. I\'m very excited to try 1872 Mandarin, I have a sample of that coming in soon. Performance is underwhelming unfortunately. It projects moderately for around 2 hours but sillage is on the light side. Longevity is meh, it\'s been 5 hours since I sprayed it on and it\'s almost completely gone. Iconic Masculine and Timeless have much better longevity, as those managed to last 8 hours on skin. I seem to go nose blind easily to this style of citrus-woody fragrances, so there\'s always the possibility that it might be affecting my experience with longevity. Also as I\'ve said before, I\'m wearing these Clive Christians off sample vials, so the amount of fragrance applied and the dispersion the atomizer achieves is really poor, which definitely plays into performance.', 'Fighting against Riyadh heat in peak summer with 2013 batch of 1872, I’m always impressed by how effortlessly elegant it is. It starts off fresh and crisp, then settles into a warm, sweet, musky base that lingers beautifully. It is pricey, yes but with over 200 ingredients, the quality speaks for itself. Layered it with CC X and the results were well complemented.', 'So I just picked this up yesterday. I usually dont give my opinion of a fragrances until I’ve worn it a while. To me, the best way I can describe this (to my nose) is blue de Chanel EDP meets Havicat with a little more spicy. After an hour I got heavy musk (when I say heavy, I don’t mean projection, the scent is mostly musk) with a hint of seeetness.  Wasn’t a projection bomb and kind of stayed close to the skin after a couple hours. But I’m going to let it mature for a couple weeks, I suspect the performance will become a little stronger. First impressions = I’m impressed Expensive as all Clive Christian is but…. It is what it is🤷🏽♂️', 'Bence harika bir pazarlama hikayesi. 50 li yılların lavanta - narenciye karışımı. Kaliteli ama ne bu fiyatlara değer ne de yeni birsey söylüyor. Gereksiz para harcamayın.', 'To keep it short 1872 seems to be easily one of the top ten citrus aromatics on the market. Definitely not the best value for money but if money is no object it’s a stronger contender for top 5 even. Excellent creation.', 'Wow, such a complex aromatic-floral scent. It enabled all my scent receptors. The scent profile may feel basic but it is definitely not.', ""It's totally men fragrance. If you have One Man Show perfume of the 80's (not the reformulated), you can see the similarity..

You get a lot of citrus and green notes. I assume its galbanum. I did not like the drydown. It becomes sweet and floral.', 'soft ,clean , citrusy in a good way 10/10', 'Review: 1872 For Men – The Gentleman’s Time Machine (with a Gold-Plated Ticket) Opening Thoughts: Spray this once, and bam!—you’re no longer in your living room. You’ve just stepped into a Savile Row tailor shop in the late 1800s. Someone offers you Earl Grey. There’s a grandfather clock ticking in the background. You’re not wearing cologne… you’re wearing lineage. The top notes come in crisp and green, with a citrus burst so sharp and clean it feels like you shaved your face with a lemon made of diamonds. We’re talking bergamot, lime, petitgrain—the works. It’s fresh, it’s uplifting, and it absolutely does not belong anywhere near a tracksuit. As it dries down, 1872 reveals layers like a Victorian novel. The heart turns herbal and spicy, with a bit of clove, pepper, and a whisper of neroli and rosemary, all wrapped up in an elegant vetiver base. There’s also a nice touch of cedar and moss—just enough to say, “Yes, I do own a globe bar.” This isn’t for the club. It’s for the boardroom, a jazz lounge, or a mysterious rendezvous involving silk gloves and confidential documents. It’s the smell of a man who irons his pocket squares and knows how to sabre a champagne bottle. Now, let’s talk performance—because at this price point, it better behave. Longevity? Solid 8 to 10 hours. This gentleman doesn’t pop in—he stays for dinner, dessert, and a cigar on the veranda. Projection? Classy but noticeable. You won’t gas anyone out, but they will want to know what you’re wearing. Mass Appeal? Surprisingly high… if you’re around people with taste. It’s refined, grown-up, and smells expensive. Because it is. Scent profile? Fresh citrusy fougère with old-money energy. Final Verdict: Longevity: 9/10 (lasts longer than a royal marriage) Scent: 9.2/10 (a green citrus masterpiece in a tailored suit) Mass Appeal: 7.5/10 (not for Gen Z hypebeasts—but your boss will love it) Projection: 8/10 (gentlemanly presence with zero arrogance) Smells like: James Bond after a meditation retreat and a light citrus brunch.', 'Classic old school citrus fougere in the same realm of Eau Sauvage and Casamorati Fiero.', ""It's a masculine fresh modern fougere. Green, lemony and aftershave comes to mind. Absolutely no way in he'll this smells like female hairspray, the reviewer who said that must be confused. This fragrance has weak longevity and sillage. Ingredients are of high quality. Not all fragrances are meant to last all day. I do recommend that people sample this and sample other expensive fragrances first. Overall I give it a 6 out of 10. I still like it, but it could be better and longer lasting. The are other brands in the market with similar dna that do the better job and for the lesser price."", ""Dry, grassy, herbaceous, and complex -- Everything you want a high end perfume to be. I do not like sweet fragrances, so I really enjoyed 1872 as it's not sweet at all. It has the vibe of an old dusty study in an 18th century mansion.  While it is a good fragrance overall, the price point is too high IMHO."", '10 years ago, I made a big mistake: I dismissed 1872 without giving it a real chance Back then, I was in London during winter, and after buying C & X, I sniffed 1872 and thought, Just another fresh scent—not my cup of tea. Fast forward to now, in the hottest place on earth 😅, I decided to retry it. This time, I let it bloom for 5–10 minutes… and wow. What unfolded was a powdery, radiant freshnes—pure, sophisticated, and unique. I immediately bought the 100ml bottle—worth every penny.  Lesson learned: Some perfumes demand a second chance. 1872 is now my go-to summer signature. A masterpiece in freshness.', 'Herbal, green, and old school, the opening reminds me a lot of Bois du Portugal but with a bunch of lime and petit grain but more subdued and less spicy, more aromatic and green. Very weak performance, I barely get over an hour, personally, I think it’s a very nice scent but atp in my collection it’s lost its novelty and I think nowadays there’s so many amazing options that bring more for less', 'Herb, Green, Earthy, So Luxury, fittable with office, event.

It opens with a fresh burst of citrus that feels crisp and energizing, then settles into a smooth mix of woody and herbal notes. It’s refined but never overpowering, making it a perfect everyday signature. While the longevity could be a bit better, the quality is top-notch.', 'Anyone looking to swap for this cologne? 99.99% full bottle, and I have the original boxes, send me your offer via pm! Thanks.', ""This is one of my favorite opening scents ever, it's so complicated and awesome. The problem is the longevity, and sadly it's not a small problem in this case.  This reminds me of fruit stripe gum - it's awesome for like 2 minutes and then it's out. The dry down is pretty much a disappearing act. You could keep a bottle on yourself and just keep spraying yourself every 30 minutes and smell like a God but that's just not super realistic is it? Even when you spray it on clothes it's out. This makes EDT look like extrait lol - but it smells awesome. Still worth a buy - just drown yourself in it! haha Edit: So I bit the bullet and purchased a bottle. What I would say is it's actually stronger than the tester. I wouldn't say longevity is much of an issue as the spray is very pronounced on the real bottle - ie: two sprays made me cough for a sec. Also I've noticed that this seems to be longer lasting on skin than clothes or at least it's more noticeable for a longer amount of time on skin."", 'dry, green, earthy and citrusy. unlike anything i’ve ever smelled in my life. a unique addition to my collection.', ""@Jaberghribi, Selon mon expérience, il n y a aucune ressemblance entre Creed Virgin Island Water et CC 1872. Tu voulais dire Royal Water? De nos jours, on trouve très rarement les parfums du style classique comme 1872 sur le marché du niche et encore moins avec cette qualité indéniable de matière première. Je trouve que c'est un parfum magnifique pour les gens qui aime ce style classique des années 80-70. C'est cher oui. Trop cher même. Mais si on veut critiquer objectivement la création sans prendre en considération le prix, c'est incontestablement un magnifique parfum de signature pour ceux qui aime la parfumerie classique."", '1872 for men Est tout simplemement une grosse perte d’argent 😵💫😵💫 optez pour le virgine island water de creed format 100 ml Economiser votre argent', 'This is not a male fragrance or a masculin fragrance , this smells like girls hair spray😂😂', 'Save your money and hang a piney car air freshener around your neck.

I'm not yet sure if I like it or love it. It is a clean, fresh, inoffensive and relaxed kind of scent. Grown up and mature. It feels like you're already there, and you don't need to be in a hurry or to impress anyone."", '1872 for Men is a gorgeously refined and sophisticated scent for the classic gentleman. It’s a beautifully smooth and gentle take on a classical aromatic fougere - oozing with class and elegance at every turn. It’s bright, citric and slightly herbal, but manages to perfectly balance any sharpness with just as much smoothness. Citrus is the name of the game here - lime, grapefruit, mandarin and bergamot in perfect harmony, with sweeter touches coming from pineapple in the background. From here, the aromatic herbal side begins to shine; petitgrain, lavender, rosemary and sage in all their glory. There’s a subtle note of fuzzy peach which again adds a fruity sweetness, but also smooths everything out with its creamy nature. This is basically the bulk of the scent profile, there are some woods and florals present but they aren’t hugely detectable. Overall I think this is wonderful - it’s not the most complex or impressive fougere I’ve ever smelled, but it’s simply so satisfying and enjoyable to wear.', 'Great masculine scent, could be perfect for a signature scent. To me, this smelled pretty much identical to New York Intense by Nicolai, so I sold my bottle of 1872 as it came short on longevity.', 'Review based on a recently purchased (June 2024) 50ml bottle. Huge citrus opening that dries down to a beautiful grassy, floral, fruity and woody scent. Lots going on here. Initial projection is huge but it quickly mellows out. This is a gorgeous warm weather scent for any occasion… summer wedding, the office, casual night out, etc. For this style of fragrance, it lasts quite well. Definitely leans masculine but I could see anyone potentially pulling this one off. I wouldn’t consider this a true “barbershop” scent but it does have a bit of that style in the background. But 1872 is also nothing like Polo Green (as mentioned in other reviews) IMO. 1872 is much fresher, more citrusy and lighter than Polo. 1872 is reminiscent of Creed Royal Water and TF Costa Azzura but I much prefer 1872 over either. I don’t find 1872 dated at all as it comes across as more modern to me. 1872 is beautifully made and the recent releases smell/perform as well as older bottles I have tried over the years. Expensive for sure, but $150-ish for 50ml thru discounters isn’t awful for this level of quality IMO. Highly recommended for anyone that is looking for something special and a bit different for the summer.', 'Blind bought this fragrance as I read many reviews going over how the style is similar to the classic barbershop fougere. Always intrigued by the classic timeless styles in fashion I decided to pull the trigger.  Scentwise it’s amazing. Opens up beautiful and citrusy, woody, crisp, zesty and smooth. As it progresses some of the citrus peters out a bit and it is rounded out in to lavender, wood, amber, and floral. It stays consistently woody and citrusy throughout its life, ultimately receding in to a calming musk.  It smells like New York Intense and Royal Water combined with its own uniqueness swirled in. It really is a timeless and classic scent which would be a staple of mine and top 5. Sadly, and surprisingly the performance isn’t as great as I thought it would be. And compared to other CC I own. It starts off nice and strong, but after 4-5hours its sillage and bubble does drop fairly suddenly. This, like I said, surprises me as all the Clive Christians I own are so strong in performance lasting over 10+ hours and usually 24.  But for 6 hours it gets the job done really well.  Overall it’s a glorious scent. But for the cooler months if you’re a fan of this style try Bois Du Portugal.  Scent 10/10 Performance 6/10 Presentation, atomizer 10/10', 'Sharp, fresh, green, crisp and vintage style barber shop fragrance. The lavender and oak moss appear more prominent to me on dry down.  Fragrance with a personality, good for warmer days and not for everyone. Shukran Habibi!', 'You’ve probably smelled a similar scent before while getting a haircut at the barbers, and I don’t mean to pass the comparison to a “barbershop” style fragrance. It’s that slightly sweet, dryish, mossy and slightly dirty, wet(isn’t it amazing that a perfume can smell both dry and wet at the same time?), fresh-cut hair smell mixed with the metal of the shears in the hand of the barber. I can’t remember if that came from a hairspray or a soap used, but it’s very similar. It’s very good. I’m happy this scent was made into a long lasting, quality fragrance. It is indeed similar to Acqua Di Gio(but with mostly natural ingredients), and a note comparison will tell you why. Less oceanic, more herbal and natural, and much more refined.', 'A more sophisticated, luxurious polo green. Just get polo green. Really could only see myself wearing this at a special event.', 'This fragrance has a pleasant and stylish smell, with a harmonious blend of green notes that give it freshness and elegance. There is a sense of luxury in its rich aroma, giving the impression of an expensive and sophisticated product. This perfume is a safe blind purchase as it is sure to please many. The only drawback is its longevity (and price, of course), which did not meet my expectations. The fragrance lasts for about three hours, after it becomes barely detectable on the skin. Smell 10/10, bottle 11/10, longevity 6/10 (but I have to say it stays a little longer on your skin than average fresh summer scent), price 2/10. Overall, I rate it 8 out of 10. Upd: I just realised if you want an alternative for better price, buy tom ford costa azzura (100$ for 50 ml), better longevity and smells pretty same', 'It’s dry, green and elegant. In the opening notes, you’re hit with a fresh burst of citrus, grapefruit and petitgrain which resembles freshly cut grass. As it settles, the heart reveals a classic blend of green hues and flowers. It lasts easily through an entire day with moderate to strong sillage. You won’t need to bathe in it, just a couple of spritzes will do. It’s fresh enough for daytime wear but best suited for a summer wedding, a formal dinner or an important meeting where you want to leave an impression. The oakmoss in the drydown adds a dry layer of earthy, forest-like depth, making it feel like you’re wrapped in an old-money gentleman’s club vibe.', 'This is the cologne that you want to wear if you are wearing a suit. It would seem strange when paired with anything casual.', ""This makes you smell like a Mediterranean citrus farmer after a long day grooming your trees. You are covered in leaf clippings and finally relaxing with a fragrant lemonade.  I typically don't like green fragrances but gave this a shot because it was on sale for over $200 off. I must say this is the exception for me. This made me realize I typically dislike green fragrances because they are too sharp, synthetic, fresh and/or aromatic. This is just pure natural smelling green with a citrus touch. Very classy, non-intrusive and the right amount of fresh. Performance was ok, was nearly gone after 8 hours. I'm used to oud fragrances that last forever but 8 seems decent for a green fragrance. I wouldn't pay retail price for this."", ""Clive Christian 1872: A Fragrant Touch of Sophistication for the Discerning Gentleman Clive Christian 1872 isn't just a cologne, it's an olfactory experience. This luxurious fragrance transcends the realm of everyday scents and enters the world of the truly ethereal. Airy Elegance for the Boardroom and Beyond The first impression you get with 1872 is one of crisp sophistication. A blend of citrus notes, particularly bergamot and grapefruit, creates an invigorating and light start. This isn't a heavy, overpowering cologne. Instead, it infuses the air with a subtle elegance that speaks of confidence and quiet power. The heart of the fragrance is where 1872 truly shines. Here, floral notes of lavender and freesia weave their magic, adding a touch of unexpected depth without losing its essential masculinity. The base of cedarwood and sandalwood provides a grounding earthiness, ensuring the scent remains sophisticated throughout the day. Perfect for Power Plays 1872 is the ideal fragrance for the discerning gentleman who appreciates the finer things in life. Whether you're teeing off with a potential client on a sunny afternoon or making a grand entrance at a corporate soiree, this cologne creates an aura of success and accomplishment. It's the perfect accessory for those moments when you need to project confidence and leave a lasting impression. A Note on Performance Clive Christian 1872 is an Eau de Parfum, a fragrance concentration known for its superior longevity. A single spritz in the morning will ensure you smell fresh and sophisticated throughout the day. The sillage, or scent trail, is moderate, ensuring you won't overwhelm the room but will leave a pleasant and intriguing trace in your wake. Luxury Comes at a Cost Be prepared to invest in excellence. Clive Christian 1872 is a premium fragrance, and the price tag reflects that. However, for the discerning gentleman who appreciates quality and olfactory artistry, the cost is a worthy investment. In Conclusion Clive Christian 1872 is more than just a cologne; it's a statement. It's the fragrance of a man who has arrived and isn't afraid to show it. With its ethereal blend of citrus, florals, and woods, 1872 is perfect for the boardroom, the golf course, or anywhere you want to leave a lasting impression of sophistication and success."", 'Classic and the wood is great', ""When I first sprayed 1872 I was immediately reminded of older batches of Bois du Portugal, except 1872 seems to me to be a step up in quality with much more going on. Since I really like Bois du Portugal, this is a love for me. (For those whom BdP smells dated or for old men, have no fear - this is thoroughly modern.) It starts with a bright, tart citrus/pineapple/petitgrain note that hangs around for nearly the whole wearing. As it dries down it stays zesty, fresh, citrusy, grassy, herbal with a mild woody/resinous base. The blending is simply fantastic. It's classy. It's quality. It could be a signature scent. It is very versatile - it could be worn year-round, but works best in spring, summer and fall. You can wear it to the office, to family gatherings, and to church. My only gripe is that the projection leaves a bit to be desired after the first hour or so, but 1872 does cling to me for around 10 hours as a very noticeable skin scent. Those who come into close contact with you will definitely smell it. And, as with all Clive Christian scents, do not pay retail price as you can find these at discounters. 1872 is one of the best cologne style fragrances for men, and among the best fragrances I've ever smelled."", 'Refreshing barbershop type of scent with a lot of citruses with a musky and mossy base underneath.

If you like black phantom and are looking for a green scent, i would definitely get this.', ""1872 For Men by Clive Christian is the undisputed king of citrus freshness, and here's why it reigns supreme in my collection. From the get-go, the top notes hit hard with a symphony of petitgrain, lime, grapefruit, bergamot, lavender, rosemary, peach, pineapple, galbanum, mandarin orange, pepper, and nutmeg. It's not just a fragrance; it's an explosion of citrus vitality that wakes up the senses with an unmistakable masculine punch. As it unfolds, the middle notes bring in the cavalry with clary sage, tagetes, cyclamen, freesia, and jasmine. It's not just about the initial burst; it's a journey that evolves, keeping the freshness alive and dynamic. Now, let's talk about the base – Virginia cedar, musk, olibanum, amber, patchouli, and French labdanum. It's not just a fleeting experience; it's a fragrance that lingers, leaving a trail of sophistication and masculinity. What sets 1872 apart is its ability to balance the crispness of citrus with a complexity that keeps it from being just another fresh scent. It's like a crisp breeze that carries the essence of timeless elegance and bold masculinity. In a world filled with citrus aromatics, 1872 For Men by Clive Christian isn't just a favorite; it's the benchmark. It's the scent that I reach for when I want to make a statement – fresh, masculine, and undeniably refined. It's not just a fragrance; it's a declaration of timeless sophistication that stands tall in the realm of citrus freshness."", 'Very expensive but perfect ✨', ""Smells really good in my opinion, a complex and mature smell. At first I was skeptical but after letting it sit on my skin for 10-20 minutes it started to smell very nice. Only thing I have a issue with now is I'm a younger guy and this is a complex and mature scent so wearing this out or wearing this around women I would hate to get bad feedback just because it's a mature scent. Still love and and most defiantly will be wearing it out especially this upcoming spring. Also might save this for formal settings in the spring and summer time as I go through college to appear more sophisticated. I would recommend to defiantly get a sample and not to blind buy because it is complex but overall a fresh sophisticated scent for the warmer months.. I will say 8.4/10"", 'Starts out very sharp and fresh, almost abrasive. It maintains a citrusy, floral, and soapy character throughout the life of the scent. I get a good 8hrs of longevity, and it projects about arm’s length for about 2 hours. The comparison to Royal Water is legit. However, these are 2 distinct fragrance that stand on their own.', 'I want it', 'I was very fortunate to pick up one of the Artwork Range bottles of 1872 Masculine with the picture of a Roman eagle on the front (2008). I am very impressed with the quality of the fragrance, especially when compared to my more recent 7.5ml travel atomiser. The fragrance is a very complex freshie that has above average performance. I feel this is more of a warm Spring day kind of fragrance, though it could work on cooler Summer days too.', 'Traditional balsamic fougere. Refined, nuanced greenery. Barbershop vibes. If that’s your thing, this can be your grail. Otherwise, steer clear.', 'Lots of sour citrus to start. Very masculine leaning. Awesome for spring and early summer for sure. More casual in my opinion. In the dry down light citrus and woods. For the price this is a try before you buy for sure. Get a sample or two to make sure this is what you are looking for. IMO this is just an OK juice. Nothing overwhelming or ""Must Own"". Enjoy!', ""Absolutely beautiful spring/summer fragrance that is very, very close to Creed's Royal Water. This one seems to haver a longer season to be worn, however it disappoints in that it disappears rather quickly. Too quickly for the cost. Thus, the value is not there for me. It would be great for someone who likes to wear multiple fragrances in one day without having to layer."", ""First, I get an overwhelming black pepper with several citrus fruits and petitgrain that blend together into one CITRUS and multiple herb notes into one HERB. After a few minutes the pepper pulls back a little, and the various citrus and green notes begin to appear more clearly, though I keep getting different notes here and there. Then the citrus pulls back a bit, too and the florals and the fruits become more clear, though the petitgrain never really goes away, keeping this masculine. An hour and a half in and the cedar, amber and musk are in full play, and the full drydown still holds the pepper, along with some slightly sweet notes, green notes, powdery florals and musk with the cedar and amber. Not quite barbershop, but also not modern, either. Well crafted and more complex than my nose can really detect. I get about 1-2 feet projection depending on weather -- high heat = more. This lasts about 4 hours, then it scales back to under a foot for me and stays close to the skin for another 4-6 hours for me. It's pretty complex for a warm weather scent, and even on the warmest day I don't find this cloying. I'm not against expensive fragrances -- all fragrances have insane markups. I have multiple Clive Christian fragrances (discounters, not retail), but when it's all said and done, it's hard for me to pull the trigger on any aromatic fragrance at this price point (or anything fresh, or barbershop for that matter), even the price of deeply discounted testers. I will happily use the rest of my sample and would keep this or the three bottle set (1872, X, No.1) if it was gifted to me, but right now I don't see myself paying for this."", ""When this settles down, it smells very close to Royal Water. It is a green fresh spicy scent. It is definitely interesting to smell, or get a whiff every now and then, but I wouldnt want to smell this constantly. Between this one and Creed's Royal Water, I would go for the latter because of the better opening. 7/10"", ""A high quality and classic fresh fragrance with suprisingly complexity/layers for this genre. I honestly wasn't expecting this to reinvent the wheel, but the way they built this and how it presents itself on skin shows skill. Citrus and petigrain with flashes of fresh fruit, flashes of fresh florals, flashes of spices and lavender, sitting on a base of musk, woods, etc. Excellent 👌 Here's the problem with this and others from the house in my experience; they are all overpriced. The ingredients themselves are great, but we're not talking about super expensive materials like real oud etc, and they use the same aroma chemicals that cheaper perfumes use. Clive Christian has a reputation of being expensive for the sake of being expensive. I found performance to be average on my skin, and a little better than average on my clothes. 400 is way too much to ask for 50ml. If I find a heavily discounted genuine bottle on the secondary market, I'd grab this one for maybe 100-130 tops.  Geza Schoen really brought the heat when he built 1872, but this isn't worth selling a kidney 🤑 If you can find it for a great price, you'll be happy.  Scent 8.8/10 Performance 6/10"", ""Nice. But nice isn't enough. Surely not enough for a such an egregious brand such as Clive Christian.

I can pick out lime, grapefruit, galbanum, pepper, nutmeg, and cardamom. This explains the old school vibe, rich and diverse. As it develops, dark floral and herbal notes appear including a very dry lavender, sage, cloves, cyclamen and turmeric. The effect is earthy, only slightly sweet, more like a dried potpourri. The base is a clean musk with touches of incense and patchouli, I'd argue sandalwood, leather and vetiver too. The twist is a lack of any animal notes, which typically support this type of composition in the old school fragrances. The overall impression I get from this in the open is very reminiscent of the Egyptian musk oil girls wore in the 90's. Not quite as hippie as the patchouli oils of the time and a conundrum of slightly sweet, spicy, resins, herbs, and floral wrapped in a warm musk. The drydown is peppery and spicy with a distinct clove note and the musk linger, only slightly sweet and powdery. Plenty of overlap with L for men, which is more dry and woody in comparison."", ""Starts simply amazing, this is one of the perfumes that you'd fall in love while trying in the store then buy. And then maybe regret.  Because after like an hour goes by, the great citrus-green opening starts to fade down dramatically and for my taste, an unnecessarily lot of floral aspects start to emerge, changing the vibe of the feel. This is also when it loses a great deal of strength and become a kind skin scent.

I was worried, I find people bag CC when all I have tried or bought has been in fact a stand out and worthy (almost) of its price point and product. Some lambasting the brand - why so much hate? Well, firstly, a scent of in simplistic terms a fresh green citric aromatic is always hard to do without it morphing dramatically into something different and underwhelming and or offering abysmal longevity etc etc. Here, no problems - awesome! A buoyant syrupy sweet slightly tart petit grain accentuates the lime and fruit on top and is absolutely brilliantly bodied out by lavender, flowers, nutmeg etc and all the other base notes in effect themselves extremely hard to discern but basically doing their complimentary support job of providing a long serving lime and citrus fresh perfume. It’s very close to Green Jeans though this has a slight middle skew of light florals where as GJ was about the coriander. So, this would sit on my rare shelf of killer citrus scents like Houbigant Duc D’Vervin L’Extreme, Tres Bien Institute Cologne L’Italien, Jacques Fath Green Water EDP and vintage EDT, acqua Di Parma Colonia Club and Tom Daxons Cologne Absolu. Not one of them the same… in fact I get occasional whiffs that remind me of Houbigant Cologne Intense… Edit: I’m reeling in my suggestion about the dry down… it tends to fade a fair bit between two and five hours to an oily residue and closely resembles Cologne L’Italien and definitely the slightly off putting green tarragon finish of Houbigant Cologne Intense - so not a great performer in longevity but when it does work it’s gorgeous and this does seem to be in the cold. Ironically this means Green Jeans as an EDT last longer!  Can anyone give me another alternative to Green Jeans?', '1872 for Men is a complex citrus lavender scent with notes that are typical of mid-18th Century fragrances that were devised to move fragrance on from what had already been done with classic cologne waters like 4711 original and Jean Marie Farina Extra Vielle. In this case, Clive Christian, a house mostly known for making scents distinguished more by their wild prices than by their stupendous smells, is clearly attempting to create a veneer of historical authenticity for itself by referencing the venerable English luxury fragrance house, The Crown Perfumery, which Christian acquired at the start of its operations. The crown caps on Christian\'s bottles reference this bit of history. So does the year 1872--the year Crown Perfumery began business. This scent is a chypre, in terms of structure, and it is built from natural materials all of which were used by Crown in their first scents. But there were no chypre scents in 1872, so this scent\'s historical patina is fake. The stuff in the bottle, however, is really good. The blending here is among the best you\'ll find anywhere and the ingredient quality is unmatched. This fragrance is what an ultra high end chypre might have smelled like in 1872 (if there was such a thing then) and if early 21st Century perfume trends were in force back then. As such, this fragrance is essentially the most refined, elegant, smooth \'freshie\' money can buy. The citrus opening is exceptional and is one of the few places in this scent where a single note can be picked out of the blend. In this case, that note is lime. Later, a fruity lavender note joins the citruses. Florals, minty and green, come along in the heart of the scent and the base is a musky blend of woods and amber accords with a hint of dirty patchouli. It is all clean, fresh and uplifting and succeeds without reliance on ambroxan or other current aromachemicals. This fragrance is genuinely excellent. Now to the big question: is it worth the exorbitant prices for which 1872 is offered to smell this way. I would say, emphatically, ""no!"" I got my bottle from a discount website, which improves the price/value relationship a bit, but the price of even the small (1.6 oz) bottle was still very high for what you get from 1872. I like this fragrance a lot, but not so much that I feel good about what I spent to buy it. You, or course, may feel differently. Bottom line: 1872 is an elegant, fresh, warm weather, daytime fragrance with exceptional quality that is ultra expensive. If you get a chance, sample 1872. You may love it and decide to bear the cost to have it. But don\'t blind buy 1872 even if you see it deeply discounted, I already made that mistake so you don\'t have to.', 'I like it...Smells fresh. 7.7/10', ""-Reminiscent of men’s hair products.

Interestingly enough it kinda reminds me of Fougere Royal by Houbigant. I think it’s that similar almost powdery aromatic note. However, where the Houbigant is sharp and aromatic, 1872 has those aspects turned down. In place there some lightly floral woodiness which meld with the aromatics to support an almost juicy deep fruitiness. The wood / aromatics / soft hints at florals surround and reign in the fruity aspects which keeps the fragrance from ever escaping elegance.  The overall effect is a modern, wearable, masculine juicy citrus peach fragrance with that’s rooted in classic men’s fragrances. It’s a hard to describe fragrance because of the amount of notes. Obviously, price make this an automatic no buy for most folks. However, with some hunting you can find this at steep discount. You can certainly find decant at reasonable prices and in such a case I’d highly recommend this fragrance. It’s long lasting with moderate to heavy sillage.

Someone below said something like ""old fashioned yet sophisticated."" I second that. Having said that, I wouldn\'t pay retail. Longevity is good, not great, but still performs better than any freshie from Creed. I paid $100 for an once and it\'s worth that.  Edit: I just caught a whiff of this on my wrist well into dry down and it smelled so familiar I couldn\'t put my finger on it, then it dawned on me. It smells like what Benetton Colors smelled like 30 years ago. True story...', 'An authorized CC store decided to quit carrying the brand, and they cut prices in half. Combining with some coupon codes and rewards points, I purchased 4 from the brand (this, No. 1, Rock Rose, and X) for much more relatively reasonable prices because I doubted I\'d ever get an opportunity to get shady eBay-like deals from a real boutique--no worry of authenticity or spoilage. Got a 50 mL for $157.50, normally $350. I feel like that\'s worth mentioning. Onto the presentation! The box is exactly what you\'d expect a bottle with a crown for a cap to come in. Overdone, but neat--just neat enough to where you can\'t throw it away, even though you\'ll never use it again. Now I\'ve got four of them sitting around. What a shame! The bottle itself is really pretty. The details are nicely done, such as the the high-quality sprayer that can really control well how much you want to spray. The cap is really heavy! I imagine it\'s solid brass perhaps? It makes it feel like a luxury product. Inside the cap, the CC logo is engraved, which goes to show the level of detail. The smell is quite good. It\'s very sophisticated and unique. It\'s green, but retains just the perfect level of citrus. It\'s clean, but not really in a soapy way. It\'s fresh, but not super sweet. It draws me in, and every time I\'m ready to 2nd, 3rd, and sometimes 4th sniff because it\'s such an unique and gorgeous blend! It\'s mature, without smelling old man. It smells rich and dense from most of its life on the skin. I\'d have no problem wearing this year round, but it\'s best suited for Spring, Summer, and early Fall--especially Summer. The longevity for me can be a problem occasionally. I live in Mississippi where it\'s been very hot and humid since I bought it (90 degrees F with 80% humidity typically), and most fragrances don\'t do well on skin in these conditions for me. This one has performed above average, though, getting me around 6.5 hours before it\'s just a skin scent. CC promises something like 8-10, which I think is bold of them. On clothes, it lasts much longer--unsure how long, but I could see maybe 10 hours with a decent strength. I typically spray twice on my wrist since I\'ve had a slight longevity issue in the heat, and then once behind the ear. Then the whole drive to work I\'m in heaven! I\'m unsure what the sillage is, but I imagine that before it hits skin scent time, it\'s probably around 4-6 feet or so. You can fill an elevator quickly if you\'re not careful. Compliment-wise, I\'ve not really gotten any, but I rarely do. Most people I\'m around don\'t really comment on things like that. I wear everything from Creed to Clive Christian to Armani Privé and never really get feedback. Doesn\'t really matter to me, though, because I love them enough for everyone put together! Would I buy it at $350? Only if I had to settle on one fragrance, which I think I could settle down with this one, very signature scent and one bottle collection worthy. You won\'t smell like everyone else, and the scent isn\'t so ""out there"" that everyone wonders what\'s going on. Anyhow, at $350, you could make a small collection of other really nice scents. However, if you like this one a lot like I do, it may be worth it! You have to decide. You\'ll quickly realize when you hold and spray this bottle that it\'s on a next level--a real luxury. When this one runs out, if ever for me because I rotate a lot, I\'ll probably just buy a 10 mL directly from CC, which aren\'t too terribly expensive; they\'re $75 which isn\'t a ton more than a 10 mL Tom Ford. 9.5/10 scent, 8/10 longevity, 9/10 sillage.

What it comes down to, for me, is that even though I think 1872 is a beauty, it's not me. And I realize now it's not the fresh and natural fruits. (I love the 'fruits' in Aventus, for example). My problem (and this is just that - MY problem) are the flowers. Once the initial (short lived) fresh citrus opening dissipates, the flowers make themselves known and I'm just not a fan of flowers taking a prime spot in a fragrance.

Grass on my skin makes me itch, so... no. I like it, but I'd never buy it."", ""This is extremely high end - it pretty much is on a level that would be difficult to match. Because it's (almost) all natural, it has a presence and a vibe that most probably have never encountered since just about anything else out there is at least 70% synthetic or more.  It's not for everyone. The opening is bracingly dry and antiseptic - a blast of lime, pepper and pungent rosemary. This is what catches people and makes it seem so immediately old fashioned.  After that , unusual florals come out and finally woods, mosses and spices in the base. This smells a hundred miles deep - layer upon layer of notes. It never entirely loses the aloof dryness, although it does mellow out and soften quite a bit.  Don't be fooled by phrases like fruit cocktail, buttery smoothness, citrus blast etc. It's not that these are inaccurate . It's more they will lead to you think of existing fragrances that you know that fit those descriptions. This isn't something familiar, and those comparisons don't work. This is altogether regal, strange, and takes getting used to. It's quite an experience.  If you are under under 25, I'd almost say forget it altogether. Anyone else, sample it if you can. It takes a while to be comfortable enough with it to make a decision on it. Despite the marketing the company uses, which of course doesn't sit well with some - it does imply some accountability. They have to live up to it - or be dismissed as a joke or a con job. Clive Christian does live up to these standards, I'll give them that. . They don't fool around at this house."", '\'1872\' for Men bursts forth with an elegant citrus accord which is both refreshing and exuberant to encounter. Bergamot, grapefruit, lime, and mandarin can all be found dotted with spicy accents of black pepper and nutmeg, the effect of which is sparkling and rejuvenating. Bergamot and lime seem to be at center stage, noticeably more prominent and lending a regal tone to the proceedings. Things veer from the citrusy to the aromatic/herbal as petit grain, lavender, rosemary and clary sage become apparent upon drying down. It is here that clary sage\'s green, tea-like scent is bolstered by the inclusion of subtle florals including freesia, cyclamen, jasmine and tagete (marigold). The gentle and slightly sweet florals act as a perfect counterpoint, subduing the richly aromatic citrus, herbs and spices of the opening. Richly green and bitter cistus labdanum and deeply resinous olibanum are accompanied by amber, patchouli, cedar wood and musk, creating a masculine base for the composition to conclude on. Clive Christian\'s utilization of only the best natural ingredients in perfumery is readily apparent when experiencing \'1872\' for Men. The fragrance is highly dynamic and engaging, with the blending of its ingredients superb. One can notice the time and careful attention the perfumer took when composing its architecture, as each note is elegantly balanced by others so as none stand out as cloying or brash. It certainly fits well within the parameters of a classic masculine chypre, having a citrus-laden opening, a middle centered around cistus labdanum, and a musky base. This provides an interesting contrast between the fresh citrus of the top and the woody-musky base. \'1872\' for Men\'s herbaceous and green characteristics fit well during warmer weather. It is notably invigorating to apply when one is battling remaining fresh despite the stifling humidity and heat of summer. As an ""extrait de parfum"" grade formulation, longevity, sillage and projection are all excellent. In summary, \'1872\' for Men is a classic men\'s fragrance which feels elevated by its unique and luxurious ingredients as well as by the deft hand of its creator. Any distinguished gentleman or fragrance aficionado would be bereft to miss this quintessential male scent.  Read my complete fragrance review at my personal blog', 'I like this fragrance. I picture an elegant gentleman in the age category 25+ who is a bit playful, but with classic style. You will wear this fragrance as you wear a classic white or blue shirt and know that your personality is enough without attention-hungry features. This fragrance will make you and those whom end up in your personal space to feel just comfortable elegance. This is a fragrance that preferably worn in the daytime during the spring and can be worn under little chilly evenings and nights during the summer. The only negative thing I have to write about this fragrance is that the Patchouli is too prominent for my nose, and I am unfortunately quite sensitive to this note. If Clive would get the idea to remove this note, I would gladly buy the 1.7oz bottle (I currently have the 1/3oz). I strongly recommend you to try it:)', ""After trying this out at Saks today I could not get out my head how familiar this scent was to me. For hours i thought about it until it finally hit me. It's nearly identical to Eau de Cartier Concentree. I personally wouldn't buy this since i remember getting bored of this scent and eventually gave it away. I would say that the longevity and sillage are equally ...... Beast mode on both."", ""Tried this yesterday in Fortnum & Masons and it is beautiful. In the tradition if a cologne type smell and I have to say smelling somewhat dated but you can tell the quality through and through.  It just reeks of quality, it smells like nothing else and the projection and sillage are enormous.  It's very fresh and zingy to start with but settles into a lovely fresh mandarin, lavender and Clary sage summer cologne smell.  At £110 for 30ml it's not cheap but it lasts like nothing I have tried before.  Gonna have to save up for this but I want it."", '@1872 & other niche fragrance gathers and detractors.: guys, rather than ""throwing salt"" for the sheer fact some of these niche frags command a pretty penny- would it not be far more productive to give us an honest assessment of your take on these scents without words such as ""disgusting, garbage or not worth it""?!?!?! Cause I\'m sure you wouldn\'t view it as such if it were $49.99..... IMO of course........', '@Mariotgomez: I love your review..... I agree with so much of what you\'ve said. Having just gotten a sample from Bergdorf Goidman a couple weeks back, I can say the following thus far: For me- it\'s a refreshing, relaxing & easy-to-wear perfume for every day and all occasions. The Petit Grain is a classic and the grapefruit note is FANTASTIC in this one (even better than the grapefruit in Terre D\'Hermes Hermes and Bleu De Chanel IMO of course) . I\'m not usually a fan of black pepper (preferring pink pepper), but I MUST SAY the Lavender, Jasmine and Clary sage, gives it that smoothness, slight creaminess and depth..... I do believe after trying it a few days that these very notes have a lot to do with 1872\'s unusual longevity for a citrus-based scent..... And yes, I DID keep smelling my hand and thinking as you did: ""this us what true perfume is all about""...............', 'realy love this fragrance... its fresh scents but not sharp to the nose.', 'I love this scent... Its bursting with citrus. But lets be honest, It really doesnt matter what I think of it, because it cost more then my car payment. If I had that kind of money to throw around I would help the homeless not fatten this perfume houses pockets.', ""HERBAL FRUIT COCKTAIL I get the authenticity of this niche house - there is no denying the natural, well blended notes. But there is something bothering me about 1872, and I can't put my nose around exactly why I only appreciate this fragrance but am not enthusiastic about it. I've been wearing it for hours now (has A+ longevity), and all I'm still getting is a really elegant (but every day wearable) herbal fruit cocktail."", 'I feel like this is a more sexy version of Millesmie Imperial, smells like buttered orange blossoms with a little spice. Sure there other fresh fragrances on the market, but this is a noticeable step above then all, especially in longevity. I showered and this still remained on skin for hours.', 'People think this smells like Adidas Sport Field? Really?', 'This is one of the best perfume I have in my collection. I have lots of perfumes but have to admit that this is really a beautiful art piece. I will say in short, the perfume lasts long. In fact I had sprayed three squirts in the evening at around 7pm and went out for a meeting and came back home and went to bed. I could still smell the fragrance in the next morning and was still noticeable. I went to bath and then it faded a little but could still smell in lightly. So powerful is the fragrance. This is my honest opinion.', 'Day 2 of owning a bottle of this juice and feel I need to be a little more descriptive. I can understand why some people would say that the longevity of this is quite poor for the price. I think this is due to the powerful and explosive opening which projects well and fills any room.  After 1-2 hours these fireworks do die down quite rapidly and so does the overall projection. This dramatic change could fool the mind of the user to feeling that the frag has just ""gone"". This certainly isn\'t the case.  Over the course of 8 hours, I\'ve asked independent people to give there honest opinion of the scent and its potency on my skin, all of which where very positive. Yes the projection does not hold to the initial radius of the first couple of hours but it still projects adequately after this.  I do tend to go for fresh, citrusy scents, especially through the summer and I know not to expect longevity. My favourite scent this summer has been Acqua di Parma - Arancia di Capri. I did get a 150ml bottle of this in anticipation that it wouldn\'t last on my skin but surprisingly it held very well and in my opinion is one of the nicest summer scents n the market. In the evening I\'ve been waring Creed Aventus, this never fails to attract compliments. I love these two fragrances but 1872 is certainly in a different league. The scent feels so natural. At first there is a burst of exhilarating, awakening ingredients, like colourful brazilian carnival. After dried down, it is so fresh and light, but at the same time is still so sophisticated, with a beautifully synergy of fresh citrus, green & floral and a clean, almost powdery finish.  Is it worth £170 for 50ml? Maybe not, but this juice is absolutely stunning and for a fresh, lighter frag the longevity can not be shunned in my. I have quite a selection and this is certainly the nicest frag I own and I\'m thoroughly looking forward waring it.', 'Had a dilemma today between this, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather and Acqua di Parma Colonia Intensa Oud. Had to buy 50ml of this and I have to say, 7 hours after a couple of sprays and I have no regrets. Really fresh and deep defined notes. Got lots of compliments all ready....', 'CC nothing special except the price :).', ""Ummm.... Why is this so expensive? It's a normal scent. Nothing exciting. Good for a summer day that's about it. It's citrusy and fresh. Doesn't last long. Too expensive."", ""Personally, I feel the gender binary delineation for this and its sister fragrance is unnecessary - the 'female' version is much more appealing in my humble opinion - less stuffy, cloying, more green, citrus fresh and redolent of a beautiful summer morning when the fragrance you most covet is one that reflects beautiful greens and vibrant citruses - try both and see what you think..."", 'The longevity is pretty bad. You have to reapply it every 4 hours.', ""I've ordered all 3 Clive Christian perfumes directly from CC website. It was my more expensive order of perfumes (EUR 1,500). I did it after I've got the samples of them from Bologna antique niche perfumery after I've ordered there CC 1872 perfume 30ml in crystal bottle (another EUR 650). When you wear the perfume of CC for the first time, you don't really like it (it's very different from all other perfumes, where the head notes are very pleasant and you immediately buy them, but after an hour, or even worse: after you've purchased it, you understand that you don't really like the main notes). Like I told here, CC perfumes are really different: you start to love them after you are wearing them at least for 30 min.

It is a masterpiece! If you want a true perfume and willing to pay $310 to $850 for a bottle. I will begin saving up for this one.  From the very first spray, you will be sent on a journey of citrus, green and spice notes. Every time you smell it, you will say: ""this is what a true purfume is all about."" Each note develops and blend with the previous one.  The perfume stays very close to the skin making it good for ""every day and any occasion.""', ""OK, given what people's general opinion on the brand and its price points are, this will not be a popular and much upvoted review. But here goes anyway - this is spectacular... I've grappled a lot with this fragrance. I love the way it smells but I never quite end up reaching for it. At some point I had to really try to understand why that is... See, this fragrance has so many things going on at once - citrus, green notes, woods and even a little bit of spice for good measure. And it's all very strong too... Basically, this perfume will make sure you'll stand out in busy and chaotic circumstances - it is the lead role in a melodramatic play, it is the lead singer of a glam rock band and I realized that most of life's everyday events aren't bombastic enough to warrant this fragrance. That's when it struck me... This is a wedding fragrance.  The bride has a much adorned flashy elegant dress, the groom has this. Pair this with a navy blue suit and wear it to your spring outdoor wedding - you will be a star. And then the special occasion will also justify the price :) ... No, cheaper fragrances don't do the same job this does - not its drama and larger than life sense. But that's also why you won't wear this everyday. Don't buy a big bottle - a small one will do.

Good stuff if you like spicy herbs!', 'Review: 1872 For Men – The Gentleman’s Time Machine (with a Gold-Plated Ticket) Opening Thoughts: Spray this once, and bam!—you’re no longer in your living room. You’ve just stepped into a Savile Row tailor shop in the late 1800s. Someone offers you Earl Grey. There’s a grandfather clock ticking in the background. You’re not wearing cologne… you’re wearing lineage. The top notes come in crisp and green, with a citrus burst so sharp and clean it feels like you shaved your face with a lemon made of diamonds. We’re talking bergamot, lime, petitgrain—the works. It’s fresh, it’s uplifting, and it absolutely does not belong anywhere near a tracksuit. As it dries down, 1872 reveals layers like a Victorian novel. The heart turns herbal and spicy, with a bit of clove, pepper, and a whisper of neroli and rosemary, all wrapped up in an elegant vetiver base. There’s also a nice touch of cedar and moss—just enough to say, “Yes, I do own a globe bar.” This isn’t for the club. It’s for the boardroom, a jazz lounge, or a mysterious rendezvous involving silk gloves and confidential documents. It’s the smell of a man who irons his pocket squares and knows how to sabre a champagne bottle. Now, let’s talk performance—because at this price point, it better behave. Longevity? Solid 8 to 10 hours. This gentleman doesn’t pop in—he stays for dinner, dessert, and a cigar on the veranda. Projection? Classy but noticeable. You won’t gas anyone out, but they will want to know what you’re wearing. Mass Appeal? Surprisingly high… if you’re around people with taste. It’s refined, grown-up, and smells expensive. Because it is. Scent profile? Fresh citrusy fougère with old-money energy. Final Verdict: Longevity: 9/10 (lasts longer than a royal marriage) Scent: 9.2/10 (a green citrus masterpiece in a tailored suit) Mass Appeal: 7.5/10 (not for Gen Z hypebeasts—but your boss will love it) Projection: 8/10 (gentlemanly presence with zero arrogance) Smells like: James Bond after a meditation retreat and a light citrus brunch.', ""This similar to Royal water Creed. It smells so elegant. Better than Creed, Fresher and richer than Royal water. The opening is a really fresh natural citrus and the dry down become little bit woody & flowery scent. This is the most fresher scent that ive ever tried in my life (i swear), falling in love at first spray in CC authentic dept. store. I am planning to buy the 100ml but the longevity keeps me think a lot. 1 hr projection in my skin, 2 hr skin scent. And Poof…… EDIT : I've bought it :)"", ""An extremely strong herbal scent, it completely takes over and it's impossible to discern anything else.

As you were.', 'This is the most masculine scent I own. Oscar De La Renta Pour Lui is close, but is obviously rougher and much, much less quality. Definitely an old school DNA. Very little sweetness, spicy and dry. I don’t find it suitable for anything except formal occasions, unless your style is very mature. It smells like an 80’s masculine scent, somewhat dated with a little something that makes it unique. That being said I’m glad I have it. I can see myself wearing it to a serious situation. Projection is ok and longevity isn’t great for the price. The ingredient/blend quality is top notch, smooth and classy. I feel it’s too dry for a flirty date scent, and too spicy for casual wear. Possibly a date to an upscale restaurant or concert. I don’t see it being a compliment grabber. If you are under 35-40 it might be too “mature”. Better suited for 40+ and professional imo. Spring and cooler weather it would work well. Probably not dead winter or blazing heat. Day to night, leaning night. Cooler days or a warm evening. Not a huge fan of the opening, but the dry down is excellent. If you’re a fan of old school powerhouses or are like me and have a collection of sweeter/fresher scents and want a black tie juice it might be worth a look.

The scent of the proletariat with a price point accessible only to the bourgeoisie. Pleasant fragrance though.', 'Today we\'re heading over to one of the most prestigious and expensive fragrance houses on the planet, Clive Christian; known for making the world\'s most expensive perfume. Not this exact fragrance, mind you. I\'m sure it goes without saying, but I have zero experience with Clive Christian fragrances. They aren\'t exactly the type of fragrance you can walk up to the Macy\'s counter and spray a tester of, so I really have no idea what to expect. I\'m hoping, based on the price point, I\'m in for something really special. Let\'s get into it; Scent: The opening is woody, fruity, and spicy. The primary notes I get are Virginia cedar, rhubarb, bergamot, and cinnamon. The strongest of the notes are the Virginia cedar and cinnamon. The Virginia cedar instantly hits my nose off the first spray with a big dose of dry, piney woodiness. It\'s not a processed, lumber-y type of woodiness like some wood notes can be, it\'s much more natural like a fresh-cut cedar tree out in the wilderness. Up next is the cinnamon with its distinct warm spiciness. It\'s not nearly as strong as the cedar, but it\'s definitely there and tickles the nose. This is followed by the rhubarb and bergamot. The rhubarb is an unusual combination of sweet, sour, and green. This is my first time encountering this note in a fragrance, and while I wouldn\'t consider it something groundbreaking it does offer a bit of character to the opening. Lastly, the bergamot lends citric and aromatic tinges in the background. The dry down is woody, ambery, and spicy. The primary notes I get are Virginia cedar, amber, cinnamon, and oak moss. The strongest of the notes are still the Virginia cedar and cinnamon. Both notes carry the same accords from the opening, just smoother and more rounded out. This is followed by the amber and oak moss. The amber has risen to the top to provide its familiar deep and resinous sweetness. Lastly, the oak moss wafts in and out of the background as an inky, slightly earthy note. The iris is also noticeable in the dry down as a soft and powdery note, but it\'s subtle. Performance: Initial projection in the first hour is strong at around 6 feet. Sillage in the first hour is strong as well with an easily noticeable scent trail. After a few hours the projection had died down to about 3-4 feet, but the scent trail was still easily noticeable. The fragrance last until about the 7 hour mark where it became a skin scent. When to wear: I feel like X for Men would be a suitable wear for any season or occasion. It\'s mostly woods, which work well any time. But it has the fruit, greenery, and aromatics to work well in spring/summer, and has the spice and amber to work well in fall/winter. As for occasions, it\'s largely the same. I can see this being worn casually or formally. Anything from a get-together with friends to a wedding, this will feel appropriate. It\'s even a safe pick for the office thanks to its safe and unobtrusive nature. Blind buy: In regards to scent profile, X for Men is a pretty safe blind buy. However, that sticker shock is real; and if you\'re looking for something mind-blowing for the price you may be disappointed. Final verdict: Let\'s go through the experience here. The scent profile of X for Men is fine; woody, spicy, a little sweet, it\'s something easily digestible that anyone can enjoy. The performance is good too, good projection and sillage for the first few hours and lasting for about 7 before becoming a skin scent. Versatility is great as it can be worn pretty much anytime and for any occasion. As stated previously, this is a scent profile anyone can enjoy so mass-appeal is high. All those things combined make for a solid fragrance. However, $580 for a full bottle of this is just absurd. There\'s nothing groundbreaking here, nothing that\'s going to make you say ""Wow, that\'s incredible!"". It\'s a fine fragrance, and if it were any other house it would be priced accordingly. But because it\'s Clive Christian, it\'s pretentiously priced. In the immortal words of Peter Griffin describing The Godfather, ""It insists upon itself"". This is a fragrance for incredibly wealthy people that want to be able to say ""Oh I\'m wearing Clive Christian, a $600 fragrance."" while looking down their nose at you. I mean for God\'s sake one of their fragrance bottles literally has ""The world\'s most expensive perfume"" emblazoned on the front of it. If that doesn\'t give you an idea of what they\'re about, I don\'t know what will. Needless to say, I won\'t be buying a full bottle of this. It was fun to sample and be able to say I\'ve worn Clive Christian, but that\'s where it stops.

Highly recommended for Barbershop scent fans . Very strong performance"", 'I’m soooo suprised of this fragrance! Tought it would be very spicy and almost to masculine leaning. However i felt a warmth inside.  If you live in scandinavia, you’ll recongnize the smell. During winter/christmas we drink something called ”glögg”. Clive X smells exaclty like ”glögg” to my nose. Hence the warmth i’m getting! I adore this fragrance, but nothing i’d like to smell like 💐', 'Nothing to rave and nothing to rant about. Basic. boring. Nice smell. Way overpriced.', 'X Masculine is an iconic and undeniably fantastic scent profile in the world of niche men’s perfumery. There’s nothing else that smells quite like it, aside from the ones that have copied it. It sort of smells like fougere meets oriental, but mainly comes through as a warm spicy oriental scent. An enveloping warmth of smooth cardamom and spicy cinnamon takes centre stage, given a sort of fresh spiciness by ginger and bergamot. All of this rests on a rich, woody base of woods, florals and Vetiver. The journey of this scent is a battling dichotomy of zingy freshness, against warming spices - and it’s phenomenal. It’s very much in the same vein as Roja’s Reckless Pour Homme, or perhaps that should be vice versa, considering this came first. However, as Roja usually manages to do so, I find his iteration of this scent profile far superior as it feels smoother and more refined. However the Clive Christian has to be respected for the ingenuity of such a scent profile.', 'Great male Gentleman fragrance , but in my opinion , best alternative is Rosa Salas, imperial.', 'I liked it. surprised to see no Cardamom listed in the notes. I check CC website & found it was the main note at the top. Refined & very well blended as you would expect. Summer day use fragrance & do not understand why people classify it as a winter scent. Performance is average I would say. Longevity 6/7 hours with personal space projection. Feels like a skin scent for most part specially after one hour. As for any luxury item, if you have the money & like to have it then it will be a nice addition to any collection.', 'Nose Note #46 Been wearing it for two days. First I smelled it without looking at the notes and I thought: ""interestingly bitter orange with sprinkles of sugar that reappear occasionally"". But I was surprised that there is no orange. Besides that I had the vaguest impression of it. One more thing is that in the base it feels as generic as it can get - woods+amber and some sweetness. The performance is greatly disappointing. The price is ever more so. The smell is great, but it\'s nothing impressive, nothing memorable...', 'This is a fougere. I have fougere royale and I like it. I used to own Dior Eau Sauvage and hated it. Eau Sauvage is not Dior Sauvage. Hated that too, though. Sauvage Elixir is the only good one IMO. CC X for Men - Heavy cedar and Vetiver, slight bergamot, almost no pineapple, am getting the rhubarb and paprika. It kinda makes my nose want to close up. Not getting much cinnamon or vanilla. It is green and earthy and the jasmine iris are adding pleasant florals, but this is not an iris powdery fragrance - probably just for some lift, which it fails at miserably.  Is this a ""baller fragrance?"" I would say no. Is it good? It\'s alright. It definitely doesn\'t smell of any artificial aeromachemicals. It smells clean and fresh, believe it or not. It\'s like a mix of a Prada clean soapy mixed with a green Vetiver intense and some very slight peppery spices. The notes listed here do not reflect the smell, in my experience. This is more of a summer, daytime scent. It is well blended, but bsolutely do not spend the amount the site is asking for. Be careful of the fakes on eBay and Amazon. Projection 2-3 ft Skin scent almost instantly..  Longevity 4.5 hours.  Age range 32+ To clarify, the CC website sells the 50 and 100ml, and the discovery travel set was sold for a while with 3-10ml bottle variety. I\'m not sure about the 30ml. I have a 100ml bottle. You should really test it before you drop that much money. For a frag under 60 dollars, you can pretty much look at notes and reviews and take the chance knowing the things you like, but more than that requires sampling to see if you like it. Just because something costs a lot doesn\'t necessarily mean it\'s good. This smells good, but is mediocre.', 'I don\'t know what all this nonsense about 30ml all being fake. Just look above and you\'ll see it states : ""Available in Pure Parfum of 30ml, and Eau de parfum of 50 and 100ml."" I don\'t know what the difference is between a \'pure parfum\' and an EDP.  Best described as smooth and understated. No note in particular stands out and everything just melds together in a harmonious fashion. Softly, sweet, spicy clean yet earthy. It is such a shame the projection is so quiet that it is essentially a skin scent. I don\'t need something so loud it announces my presence ahead of me or lingers well after I am gone. But I would like others who are in close proximity(1-2ft) to be able to smell it as well.  This is another fragrance relegated to a might have owned but let down by poor performance. And as others have mentioned the pricing just the final nail in the coffin leaving this for dead.', ""Performance on this is quite weak. It becomes a skin scent almost instantly. Yeah, it smells refined and composed with no harsh edges. Overall it comes across quite clean but not shower gel thanks to some 'earthy' notes. It leans somewhat mature and it kinda does smell like literal money or the canvas from some painting hanging in mansion or museum.  The performance for the price is quite criminal though. They must think they are Creed. Elegant composition wholly let down by subpar performance and exorbitant pricing."", ""Weak sauce. I got one of those fake 30ml then I guess because this has no projection. I need 5 sprays to the same area and it dies down to a skin scent in an hour. Pineapple/rhubarb kinda reminds me of cheap oud/vetivers combos with an inky type aroma. Cinnamon is the most present and there's some indistinguishable white florals in the background. I like the smooth base and it does kinda smell like old paper or maybe even fresh money because of the combo of paper and ink. But again not harsh in any manner. It just feels so subdued and barely there. But otherwise it is money, literally."", 'I prefer Eau Sauvage Parfum over this… they smell alike but X is the woody version.

This is a man’s scent. So soy-boys and guys who hangout at Sephora, do not proceed. You will not enjoy and just say something along the lines of “this smells like my granddad!’ - of course.. he probably is a gentleman and has many investments… X is luxurious, rich, classy. Very sophisticated and oozes class. You’d wear this in the fall and winter, cooler weather, when you want to be bold. And leave an impression. A date in a pricey steakhouse, events, Christmas market, lounge, anywhere where you’re dressing to impress. It’s a cinnamon and woody bomb, spiced up in the best way and rounded out really well by the amber; I don’t get much vanilla. Again, this is a scent for a man with hair on his chest, not a boy or a guy wearing the wrong sizing in his jeans or sport coat. It smells like everything Oajan by PdM looks up to and wants to be when it grows up.

An elegant, evocative fragrance, both for special occasions and for everyday wear, in cooler temperature conditions. With a woody heart, polished with cinnamon and amber, a little floral CCX is a remarkable perfume with a signature of its own, distinct and distinguished. Some say that there are many variants of this perfume and that it is not worth the price. Which variants? Maybe Vertus Monarh, but that one is way too sharp, lacking the gentle and comforting character. The essence of sophistication, CCX expresses power, gentleness, mystery and maturity. An extraordinary fragrance for the autumn days, when the leaves start to fall and the days become shorter and cooler in favor of the nights. It is very balanced, imposing but friendly at the same time, for lovers of somewhat more classic perfumes but anchored in the present. Clive Christian X represents one of the perfumes that should not be missing from a man's wardrobe. The price makes it difficult to acquire but not impossible.  As for the people who complain about the very high price, there are dozens of brands that practice the same prices and get a lot of hype, but this one doesn't, why?  Don t spend on ten ordinary fragrances and buy one that is worth it.  After all, it is a luxury product and a brand that is not afraid that it can only be bought by a certain category of people. The same can be said about luxury cars, luxury watches that can only be bought by a certain people. Obviously, CC prices did not reflect the value either, but art is expensive. And CCX is an artistic, tasteful perfume."", ""I like wearing this when I go out or go on a date, sophisticated, masculine, sweet, spicy, sensual. isn't too loud and keep a nice scent bubble."", ""I liked this fragrance Clive Christian X For Men from the first try at Galeries Lafayette, in Berlin, in 2019.

It is very well blended, complex and unique fragrance. It could definitely be a signature fragrance for me. I don\'t see it as an ""amber"" fragrance. It smells very classic chypre. But it doesn\'t smell old fashioned. First impression: base is very nice, dark mossy woods. Cardamom and cinnamon give it an aromatic, warm spicy accord. (Basenotes does list cardomom and ginger in top notes.) The Jasmine is there adding softness, smoothing out any hard edges. The iris is more of a main player than the Jasmine. Like in Frederic Malle""s French Lover, a woody vetiver fragrance, that has a great Florentine Iris that gives it a classy posh air... The paprika gives it a green vegital quality, that\'s a refreshing note to the dry woods. The rubard makes a great accord with the cinnamon for me. The pineapple is not too noticable, which is just right.  There\'s quite a lot of notes, but it doesn\'t smell too busy, as Roja Dove\'s Apex fragrance does at times feel busy. (a similar fragrance) Here all the parts are fittly joined in their proper place and intensity, well blended. PS: I tried wearing this again in late April. The opening 5 minutes was so synthetic and harsh. Like iso E super, Ambroxan, etc .. Very spicy in a peppery way. It smooths out after a while, with some naturals coming through.  Ranking: 7.5/10 God bless.

A hint of jasmine gracefully lifts the heart, resting upon a delightful base of oakmoss and vetiver. At the forefront, rare and exquisite cardamom, joined by fiery pink pepper, ginger, and bergamot, unite in an explosive symphony of top notes, invigorating the senses instantaneously. Derived from the heart of the Iris flower, a symbol of fortitude, a velvety and luxurious core emerges. Accompanied by hints of violet and cinnamon, these agile notes evoke the vibrant textures of an exotic bazaar. Grounded by the robust essences of vetiver and tree moss, delicately caressed by sweet vanilla, this fragrance harmoniously balances the warm tones of cinnamon, to create a serenely earthy base reminiscent of a dew-kissed morning.

Growing up very poor, I always loved fragrance (and watches but that is another story), however tough to own fragrances when you do not have any money, it is after all a luxury not necessity, although some may argue that. Some reviews I read of this fragrance, I cannot help but wonder if the reviewer gave that fragrance enough wear in enough situations, I can tell you with 100% certainty that fragrances smell different depending on environmental situation. Sitting at my computer testing a fragrance on my arm is ok, but use as a full wearing in trains, walking around a City creating a warmer body temp, in professional environment, and at an event or restaurant, will cause different results. Over the years, and over 300 fragrances tested, they all left something to be desired, all except Clive Christian X. I first tried it from a tester at Neiman Marcus, sprayed on my wrist and started walking, as the scent developed I thought, that is it, that is what I want to smell like. So this review is to say thank you to Geza Schoen, you are ok with me bro! I now layer a couple of sprays of Escentric Molecule 01(another Geza Schoen creation) with CCX, and the result is super long lasting, confidence boosting and just plain magnificent.', ""So you like the idea of a masculine, spicy and incense heavy fragrance, but find Amouage a bit too suffocating and stomach churning? Then try out X for men. Far better blended than anything Amouage has to offer; quite striking with the spices and smokiness, but the rhubarb and pineapple balance it out quite nicely. Coming back to this review a day later, and a day more of owning this scent. I cannot say how thrilled I am with this purchase. Despite not being listed as a note, I'm picking up a tea note that I did not initially. I don't know that I've ever owned a fragrance where I can smell so many different notes yet still perceive it as this well blended. Is it overpriced? Yes of course, it's a Clive Christian. But I got a 50ml for $117, and consider myself lucky for having done so!"", ""A scent that epitomizes both masculinity and elitism. In my quest for a masculine, elite fragrance, I discovered 'X for Men' by Clive Christian, a scent renowned for its luxury and uniqueness. The experience, however, held an unexpected twist. Upon application, the fragrance opens with a pronounced, bitter powdery note, adding a smoky nuance that was more intense than anticipated. This initial impression gives way to a fougère-like character in the later stages, aligning it more with traditional masculine scents. The standout feature of 'X for Men' is undoubtedly its longevity, enduring throughout the day with consistent sophistication. It strikes a balance, suitable for both formal and casual settings, yet sometimes leaves me feeling slightly underdressed, regardless of the occasion. This paradox is a unique statement of the fragrance itself. Catered more towards collectors or admirers of the Clive Christian brand's prestige, it comes with a hefty price tag. While its distinctive powdery aspect may not appeal to all, it holds a certain allure. On a personal note, I would give it a moderate rating based on my taste, but objectively, it merits a much higher rating, a testament to its distinct character and luxurious essence."", 'Not sure about this one 🤔 reminds me of green radox', 'Top note: cardamom  Middle note: oak moss  Heart note: iris', 'Iso e super overdosed with some green dry cedar terpiniol raw materials, combined with eugenol linalool rhubufuran gives that extended grapefruit lili of the valley freshness, ionenes ،simple، strong، elegant but way too overpriced otherwise still a v.good perfume!  8/10', 'The notes mentioned here seem to be wrong.

It is a freshie, but appropriate for all seasons.', 'Se siente como un aroma actual de crema corporal o desodorante de cosmética masculina aunque se creó en el 2001. Cremosa, ambarada, aterciopelada, cerosa, embriagante, acanelada y con aromas de maderas añejas, sin tonos sintéticos de habatonga y con fondos muy al fondo de aroma floral carnoso. Los tonos musgosos y de piña frescos le dan un apoyo aireando la mezcla densa pero no pesada, que te embuelven suave y refinadamente. Sin estridencias ni proyección fulgurante que quiera llamar la atención, simplemente su aroma se impone al corporal casi fundiéndose en el, sin crear frondosidad desgradable sino que parece aprovecharse de algún tono de agrado. Comprendo que haya personas que dejen de sentirla porque se funde en el ambiente sin imposiciones ni estridencias dándole calidez. Su aroma se adueña de forma suave(y repetiré mucho lo de ""suave"" porque es lo que mejor define a este perfume: suave y fundente).  Personalmente parece que en sus ingredientes estuviera presente el cardamomo, pero no está declarado en su composición.  Aromatiza la ropa con clase y con un muy buen gusto peculiar, agradable y adictivo. No es un aroma a ropa limpia jabonoso actual, pero parece un suavizante misterioso y con una oscuridad cálida  de principio a fin, que produce sensaciones relajantes. (Mi aroma preferido para sentirlo suavemente en las mantas de invierno). Pero el aroma perfecto no existe y por tanto sólo le encuentro un defecto y es que hasta que seca y se asienta, en piel y ropa, se perciven notas y aromas parecidos ligeramente entre el vino y aliño de aceitunas. Este aroma va desapareciendo en el asentado de la fragancia, haciéndola cada vez más cremosa y amaderada con juguetonas notas limpias, que participan con muy buen gusto creando sensaciones de opulencia y clase. Parece una fragancia para disfrutarla sin prisas, de forma comedida, empezando por una salida muy distinta a las actuales citricas que predominan el mercado.  La salida, es oscura y densa con una explosión de todas notas al unísono que se sienten como un cuero fresco empolvado y de una expansión muy contrastada de notas contrarias que acaban por unirse en un agridulce baile brillante, como anunciando el tipo de aroma masculino y maduro que es.  Esta sensación de salida explosiva, es corta y en el secado es cuando según la superficie donde se aplique, es cuando se va descubriendo, un perfume de golosas y suntuosas maderas oscuras aromaticas, acompañadas de fundentes notas de piel cálida. La mezcla se siente cada vez más uniforme tras la primera media hora y cada vez es más dificil identificar los ingredientes que empezaron tan contrastados y que ahora transmiten un aroma en conjunto balanceado al estilo fougere, que con el transcurrir de las horas, se hace más agradable profundo que baja su intensidad puliendo asperezas, bajando en acidez y subiendo en notas ambaradas y terrosas, para descubrir su fondo de notas, rico en matices aromaticos y amaderados, con reminiscentes notas florales sedosas. X FOR MEN Es claramente un perfume muy agradable...Pero caro....incomprensiblemente caro....🤷 Que te hace pregungarte porqué existen estas mezclas de perfume tan caras. Y la solución a esta pregunta es fácil: se paga por exclusividad y un alto precio hace que esté al alcance de pocos, por tanto es exclusivo (la pescadilla que se muerde la cola🤷) Realmente existen mejores y más agradables perfumes con el precio real de coste mas el margen del 50% por menos de 30€. Todos nos dejariamos dar una bofetada si fuese la bofetada más cara de la historia y si nos la diese alguien con fama y prestigio y nos prometiesen tener clase y buen gusto, haciéndonos sentir únicos y por enima del resto. Y eso es por una bofetada.... ¿Qué darias por un perfume que huele medianamente bien?😬 Si has llegado hasta el final de mi reseña y eres de los que les sobra el dinero porque las necedidades las tienes cubiertas..... X for men de Clive Cristian es tu perfume.... 😊 o cualquier otro de Clive, porque no ha hecho un buen perfume sino que hace muchísimos.... para todos los gustos🤷', 'I suppose in 2001, when this scent was released, it was a dark and mysterious, ""silent guy type"" kind of a fragrance. But it\'s 2023, and while it\'s well blended it just smells like a fragrance complimentary for older guys - I\'d say over 40. Wooden and amber notes really dominate here and - at least on my skin - there was no pineapple and barely any hint of cinnamon. Any of the Amouage ""holy trinity"", while not similar in notes, will evoke the idea behind this scent better than X For Men does.

Very masculine, very rich, complex, and so bottle worthy. I own two bottles of this. Lot of good things about this fragrance.  Clive has been underrated so much by the community; they get looked upon by some in fragcom with disdain, I believe most of it comes from judging them on regard to their pricing. Which is over-the-top. But in this modern day, lot of fragrances (and products) are over-priced. That isnt the issue anymore. It's all about performance, pound per pound. I dont think some people really care about the nuance and quality of scent anymore. Performance is king for them. Projection and longevity. This fragrance has above average performance. I am speaking from one who works in the office. A middle-aged man who is in a profession where the culture and atmosphere is a little on the conservative side. I am not defining things from the lens of a 20 year old college student desperate for attention whenever he walks into a room. It is an amazing fragrance, did I already mention that? Lot of spice and the blend is perfectly done. I wouldnt change a thing about this one.  Day or nite. It is perfect whenever the occasion. Work or a dinner date or a guy's night out. Doesn't matter. But the wearer needs to be an older gentleman, already set in his ways, accomplished, and confident. And knows that attractiveness comes through character. And the constant working on character. That is what I smell in this. Packaging is decent. The bottle is a tad tacky but I like it because it is a familiar look. It is Clive Christian. The 50ml bottles look like chess pieces. You can probably use a bottle as a king in your next game.

Its carefully crafted blend of notes creates a fantastic fragrance that is perfect for those who demand excellence in every aspect of their lives.

Swedoft Rasputin is a more modern take on this. If you like this DNA but you find it to be a bit tired, harsh, dated, etc., go far Rasputin as it's very very close, but slightly smoother and more accessible for modern noses. If you want the absolute closest smelling fragrance to X then go for Monarch by Vertus. A little more expensive than Rasputin (but still way cheaper than X), and it smells about as close to X as possible.

It takes at least an hour before any cinnamon becomes noticeable and the woods come in the mid to late drydown. I bought this brand new off of fragrancenet.com so it’s not a knockoff.

Its so well blended that i find it quite hard to pick out each individual note.

There's one phrase that describes this fragrance perfectly and it's not one that I've ever used for a fragrance. I'm not saying that I don't have others in my collection that deserve this title because there definitely are, but considering the year this was released and the fact that it can already be considered a timeless classic, if I own a fragrance that is a masterpiece this is definitely it! From the slightly sweet, ambery and fruity zing in the opening, to the heavily spiced cedar of the mid to the powdery, iris forward amber and woods in the base, every stage of this fragrance is executed with perfect precision. I can detect every single note in the breakdown with the exception of the jasmine and the vanilla which I have no doubt help the fragrance fullfil it's olfactive profile with perfection.

I feel luxurious, sophisticated, mysterious and elegant with superb dark vibes while wearing it. Freaking superb scent!', ""I don't know how I feel about this one. It's a smorgasbord of scent, yet it leaves me enjoying whiffs of this for hours on end. This scent remains largely linear for me, which is okay I guess, because the blending is beautifully done. This fragrance makes it hard to render a full account of, as I find it smells opulent yet linear at the same time, so I'm left pondering what exactly it is, even though I enjoy the composition. For me this is a spicy/woody fougere combo that gives off a certain fizzyness - yes, fizzyness (reminds me sort of like a cherry coca-cola) - in the opening that fades back into a spicy/woody mix once again. I enjoy this during the day, although the evening would be a suitable choice too. Dressed up or down I could see it being both, but I just use it for casual colder weather days. Fall/Winter use, as the heat would crank up the heavy aspects of this fragrance making it too cloying. The only downside I have with this is that it is overpriced - I enjoy the fragrance journey as it progresses and evolves telling the story it has to tell, but this remains largely the same. I don't think I would buy a full bottle at the retail prices suggested (500+CAD/48ml taxes incl.), but if it could be found for half that, I would purchase it."", ""X for Men smells for me like a spicy chypre. It has got very fizzy, dry and spicy opening - like strong, fresh black pepper mixed with a sort of an allspice and some dried juniper berries to make it even more spicy. This is my favourite part being quite honest. Then it slowly starts drying down to light floral chypre with a fruity twist mixed within. The late drydown (base notes) is still very chypre and woody. The composition itself reminds me of Frapin L'Humaniste because of those juniper berries. It lasts on me a decent amount of time - more than 9 hours and projection is light to moderate - just I like it to be. Being honest, it's the only Clive Christian that fits my taste.

Not for the young crowd & a compliment getter hands down. Lastly, on the smell you get, you get as others have mentioned, spice, wood, rhubarb ( the darkest of them ) with a touch of florals. There are some you can pull off on a casual day and wear it...If you did it with this one, it would be such a waste. Keep this in the lineup for the special events. This is a great one."", 'This fragrance is majestic, slightly mysterious, and extremely well balanced. This is the perfect blend of spice, wood, fruit, and florals. This comes together so well, and has amazing depth and complexity. Some fragrances go all in on the spice to the overpowering of everything else. This one is done perfectly. Sure it is spice dominant, but not at the expense of the other elements. It is fairly versatile, but more suited for colder weather, although you may notice some differences in the heat that keep it even more interesting.

Oak, cedar, moss, rhubarb, and cinnamon stalks are the main players. I get cloves also as there's something austere, medicinal, and smoky which is an effect cloves can create when accompanied by moss and woods. The composition is superbly blended. Schoen’s craftsmanship is without a question, evident in X. Here he brings contradicting notes such as rhubarb, woods, and spices and makes them play in harmony with such delicacy and sophistication. It’s a fantastic spicy, chypre, with an elegant oak note CC is known for. Monarch by Vertus is similar, but that one gravitates towards labdanum and cypress, and becomes closer to Italian Cypress. While X is a lot more spicier, and woodsier. Hell of a scent."", 'I enjoy every time I wear it, different aspects become more apparent depending on changes in temperature and humidity.

The opening of X MASCULINE showcases cardamom in all its glory bright, fresh and cool. The cardamom opening is supported by ginger, pink pepper and bergamot all masterfully blended in perfect harmony which makes for one hell of an opening. As the fragrance shifts into the dry down orris, vetiver and vanilla add roundness to the fragrance supporting the spices which feature so heavily in the fragrances initial stages.  There is no doubt in my mind that the finest quality raw materials have been used in X MASCULINE and this is evident as to me, as this screams luxury and for that, I give this a perfect 10/10 🌟  At 20% perfume concentration the performance on X MASCULINE is outstanding.

It’s a lovely smell and quite unusual but I’m not sure if I would say this was a go to. I’ll edit this once I’ve been out on the town with this on.', 'Breathtaking, signature-scent worthy creation from Geza and CC. Unlike anything you have tried until now. At first I was not convinced, the price had me skeptical so I bought a small decant from a Facebook group, wore through it, I was intrigued. I then purchased a 30ml bottle shortly after and it started growing on me. Finished that in 2 months and bought a 100ml immediately after, upon realising there is quite nothing like this, it is a masterpiece.  In a couple of words: cinnamon, airy hot&cold spices, woods, some slight sweetness from amber finishing with smokiness in the base from the vetiver. However, this doesn’t do the scent justice. There are lots of small nuances from the other notes which you pick out the more you wear it. It is simple and mass-appealing enough to be appreciated by anyone at all occasions, yet all it’s extra notes and expert blending add an additional level of complexity, making an unequivocal statement and leaving a distinct impression.  Lasts forever and smells expensive. Moderate silage, it won’t fill a room but it will get you noticed by people around you. A little story: I have a travel atomiser of this and I sprayed it in my friend’s bathroom before a dinnerparty at his parents place this christmas, he said the scent lingered on the walls and basin for almost a week and was quite mesmerised by it. He bought a decant from me shortly after. His parents, despite not knowing the brand, both people of significant financial means and status who I look up to, also complimented me on it when I wore X to their party. This is a testament to the quality and impression X leaves. The price is high, on par and higher than many niche houses. I have many regrets, buying scents from Roja, Creed, Fragrance du Bois, etc. but this one I do not regret for a second. The other offerings from the house are “okay”, I definitely wouldn’t purchase at their prices.

It's not super strong on projection but it has an underlying density to it. Almost a slight oil or gasoline vibe.  This doesn't smell synthetic in any way. Smells of high-quality.  Summary 7/10.

It was way ahead of its time.. Cinnamon isn't heavy so it mixes well with the woods.. And the opening is really gorgeous with the pineapple.. Recommended if you are into creative masculine fragrances.. Not too old school tho"", 'Ok, I’ve been living with CcX now for 3 days and wanted spend some time with it before coming to any conclusions or viewpoint. I had done a fair amount of reading on this prior (as I do with all Frags) and found a (relatively) reasonably priced bottle (30ml Wrapped Box for £85 inc postage from the Bay) and received the next day. On Very first blast my initial impression was a multi faceted floral note quickly followed by the Cinnamon which I found to be dry and bark like with a subtle sweetness (cinnamon and sugar with butter on toast) that is quite realistic. I immediately thought of Comme des Garçons Early Parfum but no way near as peppery or sweet but more a more palatable to my nose. The Cinnamon is the constant in X for me, I do not get any specific fruit notes par se but i do get a fruity vibe on top which is blended well and transitions into a Spiced Wood accord until it falls close to the skin towards its end. I would say longevity is pretty average (3/4hrs) but projection is fairly good as I have been catching whiffs Whilst its surrounding me. I’ll get this on any time of year for special occasions as it really is not cheap. It does have a regal disposition however and lifts your spirits as intended. I like X but is it really worth the extortionate prices and truly be justified? I guess that is really a personal issue, for me, I got it at a fair price point and that is my justification this time... I’ve got food in the fridge. We do tend to measure a lot of things in life in monetary terms and I admit am guilty for this. However, if we listened and were more truthful to ourselves maybe, more often, then we could see through the smoke screens. Truthfully, Our inner satisfaction and enjoyment is not necessarily relative to price, none of us like to be ripped off or mugged even, so we would be by far, much better off, on all levels if we did not mug ourselves. There are some fragrances out there that hit the spot for me in all aspects but not the pocket (all the Encre Noire’s/Cristiano Ronaldo PE etc) for example... if you ain’t no snob yet, these quality fragrances are 1st Class and satisfy me quite frankly, inside and out but don’t break my piggy bank.

X opens with a blast of harsh citrus and heavy, dusty woods. I would consider the opening to be fairly unpleasant and stringent.  The opening on my skin lasts no longer than 3 minutes - and the fragrance noticeably switches direction. I’m pulling a faintly sweet rhubarb note, contrasted with oakmoss and woods. It is very unique - and I quite like it.  As the fragrance continues to mature, the edges become softer and the woods and amber become more pronounced.  I’m drawing a slight resemblance to a mark buxton scent - in that the rhubarb note presents similarly. I can’t recall the scent - potentially devil in disguise - but if you’ve smelled the rhubarb there, it’s a similar presentation in X. My overall thoughts on this fragrance ($149) are that it’s unique, masculine and wearable. I find this to be a confidence inducing scent and I must say, I think the high praise is warranted (though I would probably feel differently if I had paid full price). This smells like nothing in my collection, and I genuinely find it very enjoyable.  This is a love for me.', 'First off, I\'ll admit that I did something that I strongly advise people not to do - blind buy. To make it more emphatic, it\'s the most expensive blind buy I\'ve made to date and there really wasn\'t any of the traditional hype to prompt the buying. I was in a fragrance buying mood and someone I know that has similar tastes to mine had bought it and said that he liked it. That, in addition to reading multiple reviews and a bit under $130, I was able to pick up a 1 oz bottle. My most expensive blind buy turned out to be a big win for me. Clive Christian X for Men is a very classy, clean and fresh fragrance with exceptional versatility that\'s suitable for virtually any occasion, when you just want to smell good. Casual nights out, dates, weddings, funerals, the office - whatever - it\'s great. The only situation where it may not be good is for someone from a younger crowd who\'s still into the clubbing scene and wants ""beast mode"" fragrances that scream out ""smell me"", in an effort to overwhelm those around them. In regard to individual notes at the opening, I have a difficult time discerning them but as the fragrance dries down, I can start to pick them up: cinnamon, a bit of woods and citrus - of which I\'d expect to smell more of the citrus in the top notes.  I\'m assuming the fresh scent of the fragrance is mostly provided by the florals and the cinnamon isn\'t your typical deep or grainy off of the kitchen shelf cinnamon. The cinnamon is much more subdued and blended in a way to where I\'d picture it as a very fine powder that \'s expertly blended. In other words, you\'re not going to smell like you\'ve been rolling in heavy cinnamon.  From what I\'ve seen and written myself, it seems that people write much more glowing and emphatic reviews when they first get a fragrance but the enthusiasm wanes in retrospect. In this case, I truly believe that this is one that I\'ll always have on my shelf. It\'s instantly become the best ""dumb reach"" fragrance that I have and without question, it\'s absolutely perfect for the office,  Projection and longevity are average - about 6 hours or so - but about what I\'d expect from a fragrance of this caliber.  In the end, I liked it so much that I went back and bought the 3.4 oz size. The 1oz size bottle is small and compact enough to make it perfect for traveling.  Normally, I don\'t give numerical x of 10 ratings but I\'m going to do it in this case.

The quality is absolutely incredible. It's like this is super dark and heavy BUT being so light and airy at the same time. It is so weird but it all comes together to make one extremely unique scent.  I've never experienced something so opposite in the same bottle.  The dark and heavy side makes me feel like this is too mature for me (I am 28), but the light and airy side makes my mouth water. Cedar, cinnamon, amber, bergamot, styrax, vetiver, iris.... 10/10 for a superb fragrance way before its time!"", ""It took me a few wears before I even could say what it smells of. It is complex, and various parts come out at different times. The cinnamon-rhubarb thing is what I'd say is the main feature now, and I like it. But sometimes I get just the rhubarb by itself, very clearly, which is gorgeous. At other times it smells soapy, or I get a stale fruity drydown which I associate with a part of Amouage Jubilation that I don't like so much.

Combining with some coupon codes and rewards points, I purchased 4 from the brand (1872, No. 1, Rock Rose, and X) for much more relatively reasonable prices because I doubted I'd ever get an opportunity to get shady eBay-like deals from a real boutique--no worry of authenticity or spoilage. Got this 50 mL for $132.25, normally $350. I feel like that's worth mentioning. I almost didn't buy it because I liked it least of the other 3, but I figured I'm paying Sephora/Ulta prices for one the most niche and high-end brands out there. Glad I got it; it's unique and standout.  The bottle on this one isn't quite a special looking as the others, but that cap, like the rest of the, is really nice! The sprayer is also on-par with Creed, if not nicer. It's got a lot of control. This is the undoubtedly the most masculine scent that I own. It's also probably the longest lasting and probably highest sillage, too. It's like a cloud of man. Not for the faint of heart. You can't be dainty and easily pull this off. It's likable, and I think fairly versatile for most occasions in small doses. The smell is very woody with an undertone of spice that carries throughout the scent. It's maybe a little oriental. It gets better as the day goes on, becoming smoother and more likable as it develops. It got on one of my watch straps, and it lasted on there kinda as a skin scent for over a week--smelled like one of the best scents I've ever smelled in my life! It's wood, without being oud, which is really good because most people I'm around HATE oud! Would probably do best in the Fall and Winter, but I've worn this a few times this Summer, which is when I purchased it. This is the most potent fragrances I've ever owned, and it just needs a very small amount. My 1.7 oz bottle will last forever. If I ever run out, I'll buy a 10 mL directly from Clive Christian for $75--which is well worth it because you have to be so sparing in using this so you'll go through that over the course of what you'd probably do for a bottle of much larger size for that price. Would I buy it again? Definitely, especially at the steal that I got it. At $350? Honestly, maybe. It's quite unique and would last forever. 10 mL is probably the way to go, though--at least for me. 9/10 scent, 12/10 longevity--lasts forever, 10/10 sillage."", 'Absolutely NO scented water is worth the amount of money these clowns rip the naive public off for!

Having sampled this on skin a couple times, I can say objectively this is a very nice, spicy-woods scent. Labdanum, styrax, and cinnamon blend to make a comfortable warmth in the fragrance which is accented by the sweet woodiness of Virginian Cedar. Of course, this has been done before in similar fashion, spicy woods are nothing new. However, looking at X Masculine it is a very nicely composed scent. This is obviously of a higher quality than something like Ferrari Silver Essence (a VERY quality fragrance for those of you who like smoky spice and woods); it is complex and has dimension and depth. The spice and woods are complimented by a mild tart fruitiness, powdery notes, and a touch of oakmoss.  A quality fragrance, regardless of price.', ""@C-Sauce Glad to hear that.

Just like CCX which can be said from the interview Both Christian Provenzano and Geza Schoen worked on it.

If we consider him as the main director of this house which many perfumers worked under his supervision, atleast they should have named him as one of the perfumers of this fragrance. This raised some questions around how fragrance encyclopedias get informations about perfumer(s) of certain fragrances.another reason is found when you try his other perfumes on other houses and you would find his signature in CCX.He is a master perfumer in working with oud and oriental and spicy materials. Same issue is visible on Creeds line in fragrantica.they don't name perfumers of many creed's fragrances like Green Irish Tweed,Silver Mountain Water,Virgin Island Water,Aventus,...

If it’s edgy, angular or trendy you want, look elsewhere. But if you want your scent to ooze class, you can’t go wrong here. (Just hide the tacky bottle from guests.)

I find there are no notes which are particularly dominant or exposed in X but rather it's a unified blend which is made up of all of these elements equally contributing to its whole. It has a timeless quality which smells both traditional and perfectly at ease in a contemporary setting, though perhaps best suited for the over-30 crowd. Projection is both solid and reserved, which is perfect for this kind of scent. It's not supposed to be loud or attention-seeking, yet it's certainly there, and will be noticed by those nearby.

This ia a rich potent juice that exudes refined masculinity and develops beautifully on your skin. It is a cuddly scent that has moderate to strong projection, sillage and longevity.

It's a nice fragrance, but I have two issues with it. First, I don't like the vetiver note in the dry down. It's prominent and similar to vetiver notes in cheaper fragrances (Encre Noire). A fragrance at this price shouldn't share such a prominent note with cheaper fragrances. Secondly, although this lasts a long time, it does not project. I smell myself all day, but someone 3 feet away can't smell it. It's deceiving because it is so strong when you're close to it, but it suddenly drops off the map at about 2 feet.

Many have been likening it to 1 of my Niche favorites; Reckless, by Roja but I cannot be inclined to agree. Reckless is simply better with its blend and more refined and smooth. It is also more syrupry-sweet rather than the powdery-sweet of X. Plus points are X is a little sweeter but unlike Aventus for Her, there's no violet to add a 'blue hue' to the sweetness of the pineapple; it's like a thick natural syrup of it here and powdered up a bit later on by the iris. They're sort of the same appeal-wise to me; not too much at all, sort of average but nothing I'd come close to buying!! There are also some spices to add the slightest hint of cooking-green and exotic nature. The Amber is very good here in the drydown, subtly sweet yet gentle but present and assuring. The Quality is not going to trouble the Creeds or Roja too much but it's up there, close. I struggle to find pimento but maybe some oakmoss might become a little intrusive on few and far between wearings in the coldest weather but it's not really an issue. The iris becomes more imposing and any punch the cedar may pose is rounded by either the vanilla or labdanum resin.

Great summer scent!!', ""If you launch and maintain a tacky marketing campaign like CC's, you had better put your money where you mouth is when it comes to the juice. And they delivered the goods with this one. The ingredients are high quality and expertly blended. Jasmine, pineapple, cinnamon, ginger and cardamom combine with orris, vanilla and cedar wood to create a lightly smoky, mossy, addicting effect. The cinnamon is very dry and natural, not candy-ish or cloying, and is a core component of this fragrance. If you don't like cinnamon, you may want to look elsewhere.  It smells nearly identical to Roja Dove Reckless. It sits close to the skin after the first couple of hours and is more of an intimate scent. It is not heavy or dark, and I find it suitable for both warmer as well as cooler climes, and incredibly safe and elegant.  But is it worth $220 an ounce? That's a tough call with so many good choices for less money. I've seen others compare it to Costume National Homme, which costs a fraction of X ... But then again, Roja Dove's Reckless extrait retails for $480.  At the end of the day, I think it is superb and wanted it in my collection. Forget the corny marketing and give it a test run or pick up a split. It is a perfect 10/10 and worthy of your consideration."", ""That guy from the Dos Equis commercials? The Most Interesting Man in the World? He doesn't always wear cologne, but when he does, he wears Clive Christian X.

Very mature and opulent fragrance but in a good way. Performs better in the summer evenings. Try before you buy because it's a special one."", ""Upon initial application, there is a brief playful interlude featuring a bergamot-pineapple accord which is laced with a myriad of spices. Biting cardamom, piquant pimento, terpenic juniper berry and spicy ginger are most notable. The quartet harmonize well and tickle ones nose with their vibrancy, while lending an overall exotic and Far East atmosphere. A floral heart emerges amidst this lively opening, featuring indolic jasmine sambac. Its scent is more musky, spicy and mysterious in tone when compared with the more traditionally used jasmine grandiflorum. Here it renders an alluring and sensual quality to the composition. Orris root adds yet another layer to the sultry heart by creating a caressing smoothness with its silky, sweet scent. As the fragrance dries down, a robust woody accord rests in its base. Most notably cedar's woody, linear scent is decorated with warm piercings of cinnamon. The cinnamon so elegantly utilized by the perfumer smells authentic and rustic, less harsh and synthetic. Vetiver and oak moss lend a smokey muskiness while amber and vanilla create an oriental flair. The amber-vanilla fusion in the dry down is subtle, avoiding becoming too powdery, too gourmand, or too resinous.  'X' for Men by Clive Christian is an enigmatic fragrance, one which is deeply masculine and debonair. A myriad of aphrodisiac scents are included within the composition. Vanilla, amber, cinnamon, citrus, jasmine, cedarwood, vetiver and ginger are all considered natural erotic scents and are all featured within the fragrance. Sillage and longevity for 'X' for Men are superb, being still perceptible on skin and clothing even after twenty-four hours post application. Due to the depth and sophistication implied by the scent, I prefer to reserve wearing it for evenings and nights out on the town. It would certainly work as a date night fragrance where its true aphrodisiac qualities may be taken advantage of. The fragrance is heavy and dense, seemingly best suited to wear during the colder months of autumn and winter. One cannot go wrong in adding 'X' for Men to their personal fragrance arsenal.

Pardon the touch of melodrama, but I couldn\'t in all honesty state it in a crasser manner... it just has a bearing that is, well, royal. On first impression, I thought it was a beautiful floral spicy perfume that evoked a pleasantly warm and vibrant feeling, but couldn\'t say for certain that it lived up to my grand expectations. That doubt went away in time as it developed into a lush, luxurious symphony of spiced orris and vanillic woods tamed with a flourish of floral sensibility, and has currently mesmerized, enchanted and awed me into declaring it my favourite fragrance. On my skin, it lasts longer than any other in my collection and has excellent projection and sillage for this type of scent. It isn\'t as weapons-grade as some others I own, but that plays in its favour, as it is of a more subtle, elegant character that perhaps truly deserves the regal insignia on its packaging: it doesn\'t wage war on the olfactory senses, but instead romances them with gentle force. That said, I realize that Clive Christian gets some deserved criticism for its boisterous marketing that some may feel borders on gauche, but thankfully the bottle for \'X\' doesn\'t have the lofty ""most expensive"" moniker stamped on it as \'No.1\' does. As for the pricing, yes it\'s bloody expensive, it\'s a luxury item afterall, but given that it\'s an extrait concentration (25% vol.), when comparing it to other niche quality extraits on the market (Guerlain Habit Rouge L\'Extrait costs about 300 Euros for 50ml, Puredistance M retails for $590 for 100ml), it doesn\'t seem as significantly overvalued. I can attest to its superb quality; it\'s the only perfume in my collection that doesn\'t cause burning irritation when sprayed on my sensitive skin right after shaving, a testament to the lower alcohol content and high quality natural ingredients. All in all, I am thoroughly delighted by it, and with 2-3 sprays per use, the bottle should last me a good long while. A wonderful fragrance, can be worn year round but most appropriately for formal occasions. It gets my highest recommendation if price isn\'t an issue. A masterpiece in the realm of modern perfumery.

Unlike anything you have tried until now. At first I was not convinced, the price had me skeptical so I bought a small decant from a Facebook group, wore through it, I was intrigued. I then purchased a 30ml bottle shortly after and it started growing on me. Finished that in 2 months and bought a 100ml immediately after, upon realising there is quite nothing like this, it is a masterpiece.  In a couple of words: cinnamon, airy hot&cold spices, woods, some slight sweetness from amber finishing with smokiness in the base from the vetiver. However, this doesn’t do the scent justice. There are lots of small nuances from the other notes which you pick out the more you wear it. It is simple and mass-appealing enough to be appreciated by anyone at all occasions, yet all it’s extra notes and expert blending add an additional level of complexity, making an unequivocal statement and leaving a distinct impression.  Lasts forever and smells expensive. Moderate silage, it won’t fill a room but it will get you noticed by people around you. A little story: I have a travel atomiser of this and I sprayed it in my friend’s bathroom before a dinnerparty at his parents place this christmas, he said the scent lingered on the walls and basin for almost a week and was quite mesmerised by it. He bought a decant from me shortly after. His parents, despite not knowing the brand, both people of significant financial means and status who I look up to, also complimented me on it when I wore X to their party. This is a testament to the quality and impression X leaves. The price is high, on par and higher than many niche houses. I have many regrets, buying scents from Roja, Creed, Fragrance du Bois, etc. but this one I do not regret for a second.

This is a really solid release by Lalique. I like it! I can see the comparisons to Gucci Pour Homme II. Opens with a crisp refreshing citrus blast over a woody bed of violet and cardamom. As it settles down it dries into a slightly sweet beautiful woody amber with subtle warm spices (that's where I believe some are drawing the Spicebomb comparison). I would say it's almost like a fresh version of l'Occitane's infamous Eau des Baux. Performance is average: I got about 6 hours with 5 sprays around my chest. Projection is good for the first hour and grows more muted by hour 2, giving pleasant wafts for the following 2-3 hours and finishing as a skin scent in the last hour or so. I would say the performance is slightly better than YSL l'Homme as is projection, to give a benchmark that many are familiar with. Not beast mode performance by an means, although when it was released it performance of cheapies wasn't as relevant as it is today. I could see this working well in all 4 seasons except in the extreme heat or cool. As someone else already mentioned, this would be fantastic for layering, I could see this being used in place of something like an Escentric Molecule, pleasant smooth slightly spicy wood is what you are getting for the bulk of its duration. Something like Dior Homme Cologne 2022, Issey Miyake L'eau D'issey Pour Homme, or YSL l'Homme would go great over this and they would perform better together. My final note would be that after a little digging, this was released as both an EDT and an EDP with slightly different notes according to the variation, but they both seem to be very similar. The modern bottles have a 2-D engraving of a horse head and seem to all be in EDP concentration; as far as I can tell, the EDT is no longer in production.  Equus is very pleasant, albeit simple, but it does lack a certain je ne sais quoi. Subjectively, I'd give it a 7.75/10 even though I want to mark it as a love because I'm very biased in favor of Lalique frags."", ""Gucci Pour Homme II meets Spicebomb?!? Sign me up! Just ordered a bottle, can't wait to try it!"", ""A spicy refreshing soft woody fragrance. Composed very well and smoothly blended.

I envision an older retired man on a yacht or pleasure boat in the Mediterranean enjoying ice cold vanilla mojito when I smell this even though the fragrance doesn't have mint or vanilla in it.

Lol! And yes, the performance. I\'ve for the most part found that with many Laliques, after they\'ve ""macerated"" for a couple months have a vast improvement with performance and even the scent itself, but the performance hasn\'t changed (too much) with Equus. Now, It has improved just a bit, and my opinion has changed bc I\'ve realized that maybe a soft, ""Gentlemanly"" scent certainly has it\'s uses and I suppose it\'s good to have some fragrances with more dialed back performance. I really do like the citrus/Juniper berry opening and dry/woody dry-down and find it quite classy/elegant.  Imo classy-gentlemanly-elegant scents shouldn\'t scream off your skin, plus it is nice to have some fragrances that behave the way Equus does. I do get about 3 to 4 hours on skin before it becomes a pretty faint skin-scent, and it does last a bit longer on clothes of-Course. Equus is great to wear for office, maybe church, interviews and meetings for instance bc it can be considered a professional smelling dna that wont offend others around you especially bc of it\'s intimate sillage. Equus is a very nice, scent that\'s quite versitile bc of it\'s soft/moderate performance. Now Ive read here on Fragrantica from a few folks who say that this new formulation/performance does NOT compare to the older formulations, but I guess I consider myself lucky as I don\'t know what I\'m missing. As for the current formulations, it\'s a nice 7 outta 10 scent imo.', 'This was just 20€ but it smells like money.', 'Wonderful spring/fall barn scent.

It's a like but not a love for me, as I've come to realize I'm not a huge fan of the dominant sequoia which ironically makes it unique. The citron and bergamot is the star of the opening (my favorite part) and stays present throughout the performance but eventually takes a seat to the sequoia, vetiver and cedar. Overall a great sophisticated manly scent that's great value for it's price."", ""Mostly I get juniper and other wood notes, sweet powder, and cardamom. Not super sweet, rich cardamom like in ysl la nuit, more like cardamom herbal tea. The drydown has some of the mossy patchouli wood quality of LPH lion, which gives it a welcome bit of heft and maturity. Very nice. It really doesn't smell like gucci pour homme 2, which I have owned for many years, but it is in the same family of sweet, powdery wood fragrances with green notes and spice. GPH2 has a pronounced cinnamon note and is much sweeter, with peppermint and a transparent cedar. Equus is more woody and herbal, with a pleasant bitterness (but still powdery and sweet)."", 'Around December 2022 I took a trip to Monterey and happened to receive my (engraved) bottle the day of the trip. I will forever have a special place for this fragrance because I feel like it encapsulates the feeling and raw nature of Highway 1 the Big Sur coast and the 17 mile drive in Monterey. It is so naturalistic light and woody and has a regal old money feel to it.

Renowned for their glass blowing skills, the company naturally began crafting ornate vessels for their own perfumes.  Equus is a woody unisex-masculine fragrance comparable to Chanel's Sycomore of that house's Exclusifs collection, but at a vastly more affordable price. Unfortunately the new bottle design abandons Lalique's glass making heritage and replaces it with a tacky two dimensional horse engraving. The formula has also been shamefully diluted. I am not sure why Lalique decided to diminish their brand when middle eastern competitors (plagiarist thieving clone companies) are issuing releases in increasingly elegant bottles. Some executive should probably be let go for this scandal. Critiques aside, for $20 - $30 Equus is still a steal compared to Sycomore.

Quorum on the opening is an insane explosion of harsh synthetic cedar and ginger and needs time to settle to become a more pleasant wear. This is way more natural smelling and beautiful right away.

I'm giving it a very generous like score because I do like the scent but my god, you'd want to spay this twenty times each application and even after two hours you'll struggle to know is it still there. Maybe it's a very nose blind type of scent but I was disappointed. I wouldn't buy this again. Your barely getting your thirty quids worth.

It’s like a more mass appealing designer version of Creed Royal Oud with the addition of bright citrus notes. I’m not saying it’s a clone, but if you think of what Mont Blanc Explorer is to Aventus, that’s kind of how Equus is to Royal Oud in my opinion. It’s fresh and woody, with warm spices. The cardamom has a nice subtle sweetness. It’s just super pleasant and comforting to me, but I could also see the opposite sex finding it alluring and sexy.', ""Wonderful scent. Can't believe my bottle is already 10 years old and the juice still smells fantastic."", ""What an amazing classy, woody fragrance. A couple months ago, I saw this on FragranceNet for around 30 dollars. And I blind bought it. I was impressed by how high quality this fragrance was for the price. It starts very woody, citrusy and peppery ( Even though black pepper is not listed in the note breakdown ). It dries down to a more woody, slightly less peppery, fresh spicy fragrance.  The performance is pretty good one this fragrance. I get around 7 hours with a medium projection on my skin. I recommend this for all seasons, best during the spring and fall, but you can also wear on summer nights as well. This makes this fragrance extremely versatile for all seasons and occasion. You can wear this casually dressed down, to a graduation, dressed up, running errands, and maybe a party in the day time. You don't have to go too heavy on the sprays too, in my experience I would spray 6-8 times to make it last longer. But you can do as many sprays as you want, this is just my personal preference.  Lastly, this fragrance suits all age groups. If you're a young guy, I could see you rocking this. If you're an older individual, I could also see you rocking this too. If your asking if its a safe blind buy, then yes it is. This is a perfect gift for any age group.

Both are excellent for the price and I enjoy both. Actually and I am my second bottle on both - despite owning tens of fragrances, these two I actually ran out of. Both are just so super great for simple everyday use. Since I never found these similar that comment about similarity made me test thoroughly again. There are similarities in the woodiness in the opening but otherwise I do it find them similar at all. Equus is woody spicy and fresh and great for versatile use. it is classy and great for work, but not playful or sweet. Equus is for classy and serious moments. Str8 ahead goes quickly way more aromatic and is way less woody and is a great alternative for citrus freshies but I would not use it for work or when wearing something stylish. I like to use it for the gym mainly. I could use it with jeans and a t-shirt, but not with anything more formal. Neither one is for dates or nights out. The first bottle of Equus is actually the only perfume in my collection that has eventually gone bad. It lasted about 4-5 years but then the smell turned sour and the color of the juice changed. Luckily I only had about a fifth of the bottle left at that point.', ""It's very surprising not to see cedar in the pyramid here, but I guess it must be the sequoia. Regardless, the violet leaf gives this a very green sappy conifer feel, like fresh-cut cedar with a touch of musk in the base.

I'm not familiar with any earlier version but I do know Quorum Silver and happen to come from the countryside. This is indeed akin to some more refined, less spiky, though not necessarily better version of the Quorum. In practice the two are probably interchangeable.  While I can understand why some say that this smells like hamster bedding or wood shavings, I don't really get either. To me this is quite authentically semi-fresh and green (though woody), a little like grass that has yet to dry to hay. It also has a slightly fruity spiciness that makes me think of some old-skool, natural, home-made cola or something similar. It makes me think of galangal or something else rooty, and/or some kind of aromatic (vetiver-like?) grass that someone in Indonesia or Malaysia might use to make tea.

I definitely can't imagine younger guys wearing this fragrance, because from his exit until his last breaths, he demands fine clothes, high-design shoes, ultra exclusive places and fine people around, drinking sparkling wine and eating canapés.

Soon, it takes on a more serious look and brings the DNA of finesse that Lalique imprints on her creations, that chypre sensation which has citrus in the middle making the process more airy, close to the skin and why not lasting?! Burning woods are perceptible here and you can't help but feel like you're about to start a millionaire betting race (I've never been in one, physically, but I imagine)! Finally, it ends up being super aromatic, with very pronounced Vetiver roots on a fine leather from a car seat and a few more floral hints, but what most catches my attention here is the sweet touch of the resins that are like a second skin, characterizing its farewell like a fine post-shower for a man who definitely knows how to take care of his beauty."", ""It seems to me like spice bomb leau version.

Blind Buy that I finally decided to take a plunge on due to alot of glowing and helpful reviews (Rowan Walters and Alphairone stamps of approval always get my attention).  Word of warning, I was hoping to receive the old indented bottle, as I just like the aesthetics more - I ordered off a discounter on ebay for $30 and the old indented horse bottle was pictured, however I received the new etched style. Unless you have confirmation otherwise, you\'ll likely receive the new style. Totally fine, as I don\'t display my bottles, but the etching does seem a little cheap in comparison. Moving on.  From one spray to the wrist: opens up with fresh citruses, and a really nice, ever so slightly sour juniper (perhaps bolstered by a subdued violet note?). Quickly transitions to cedar/woods & spice, with a touch of pepperiness. The woody and cedar notes in this are definitely there from the jump, and much nicer and more present compared to others I have encountered (looking at you Quorum Silver). There is nothing sharp, synthetic, or cloying in this one, which was my main gripe with Quorum Silver. That one had a nice cedary base with spice, and I loved the overall profile, but it just had a single note in the top/heart that would just dig into my nostrils and ruin the experience. Nothing but smoothness from Equus in comparison, although performance does seem slightly more shy.  Initial vibe impressions are a great balance of outdoorsy, down to earth wisdom, and refined, tasteful elegance. Quiet, understated, and simple refinement. Not in your face, Equus knows there is an art to subtlety that wins out over those who shout. Although all the notes are traditionally masculine, I could actually see this on working any gender, and is more about personality fit and note preference.  Skews a bit more mature as far as age. If someone under 25 were wearing this you\'d suddenly find yourself referring to them as your ""colleague"" or ""fellow"", rather than ""co-worker"" or ""pal/bud/friend"". However, Equus doesn\'t take itself too seriously, and overall strikes a wonderful balance in scent profile and in tone and overall ambience. I\'m really satisfied with this one so far, and looking forward to repeat wearings and further experiencing the intricacies it has to offer.', ""It's such a beautiful, well-blended masculine scent. The potent woods and resins mixing with the mace is something that is far too rare. It's a welcome change from all the peppers you smell now. It legitimately makes me happy to smell this. I wish there was a higher quality version of this somewhere. Lalique has moved on though and there will never be a surprise parfum of this coming out. The warnings about skin chemistry are also somewhat true. In high heat this can stop being beautiful and become too cedary and astringent, even a touch uric. Unfortunately I picked my bottle up right as they transitioned to the pathetic etched cartoon picture. The collar isn't even attached on my bottle, it was just glued down. Lion also has the same cheap construction but the glass was at least original quality. This was easy to recommend when it was $25 but you really need to be a fan of these older style Laliques to seek it out."", 'Beautiful Bottle.... Beautiful Scent....

A real quality feel to it and the bottle is the nicest I\'ve come across but somewhat let down by the cap which becomes literally ""fall off loose""... Not one to pick up by the cap...

An olfactory hum for the evenings."", 'A prequel to Encre Noire. As in the cinema a saga often sees the birth of very high level ""spin offs"" (see ""Annabelle"" in ""The Conjuring""), Equus is the spin off of the sunny side of Encre Noire. Don\'t use it in winter, you\'ll kill it. Use it when it\'s hot and your body temperature rises a lot. Virile, magnetic, it gives the idea of an earthy and humid herbaceous with flashes of warm light filtering from the branches of the trees. Recently revisited, the bottle is now much prettier, with a decidedly more expressive and slightly thoughtful horse, and the fragrance has more pungent and herbaceous notes, with an even more pronounced woody base. Perhaps the best Lalique perfume, even better than Encre Noire.', ""Citrus, Aromatics & Herbal, Spices with Woods & Vetiver. The Leather is pretty muted in the opening but comes out as it starts to dry down. The Citruses don't stick around all that long at which point it goes more Spicy, Aromatic & Woody. The Violet Leaf does give it a little bit of a Petrol quality. On the far dry down, I get a good dose of ISO E Super which gives this a little bit of a Hamster Cage Shavings vibe, but not in a bad way. Pretty simple but also complex at the same time. This is not a heavy projector or a strong fragrance. It's pretty subtle and understated.  I got a vintage bottle for $35, so the quality is much better than the price tag as with most Lalique fragrances from discounters. I have heard that the newer design doesn't perform (horse printed on the bottle vs etched in on the older bottles) but can't really attest to that. This smells a little old school, since it was released 22 years ago, so I'd say 30 and over would appreciate this more than the younger guys."", 'Those citruses in the opening are bright and the woods mixed with the herby sharpness of the juniper almost has a woody ginger type scent. The citruses fade and it becomes a spicy woody scent, with a sightly piney/herbal crispness. The more it dries down, the more warm and woody it smells, but it keeps a crisp and refreshing backbone all the way throughout. A generous price tag for the quality of the blend. This is an all time favorite for me.', ""Spicy woody, warm, properly sweet, and tender. Towards the end stage the woody bitterness is charming. Redwood and Sequoia are prominent. The cardamom and mace really enthralled my heart.  Projection at about an arm's reach. It's introvert and low-profile, with moderate longevity (longevity is much better on fibre). For moderate or cool temperatures in spring and fall (perhaps in winter too). New bottles have cartoon image that looks so cheap…contra the elegance of the bottle design. $35/75ml is just acceptable, considering the poor performance of EDP version, although the performance may be the necessary side effect of its tenderness."", ""This smells really nice, fresh, and woodsy. It is strong. I got it mainly for the strong juniper note. This is definitely masculine and not anything I'd ever wear out in public or even often at home LOL. Juniper brings me happiness though :)"", ""I must say that I am always dazzled by this number from the sensibly-priced house of Lalique. I have the EDP, and when I apply it, there's a nice rush of citrus and pepper on a bed of fresh juniper wood shavings. It feels rural, countryside, woodsy as all outdoors, Woodsy Owl woodsy, Smokey the Bear woodsy, a horse is a horse of course of course woodsy. I want to wear a Pendleton sweater and throw on my Danner boots, jump in a pick up and choose a Christmas tree.  I have the horse head in-relief bottle; apparently the cartoonish etched horse bottles are a bit of a disappointment to others, but that's just conjecture. This just brings me a smile to my face and a spring to my step, right down to its blurry straw bale vetiver and timbersilk base."", ""What a bizarre assessment by 'StaticCentreHalf'. While the quality of the fragrance and whether it appeals may be all that matters to you, it's certainly not the case for everyone. Believe it or not, there exist people who like pretty things; I count myself as one of them. And although I don't feel as strongly about it as Agent Strong, I do, er, strongly feel that the update to the bottle does take away quite a bit."", ""What a bizarre assessment by 'Agent Strong.' An attractive presentation is nice enough hut wholly irrelevant. The quality of the fragrance and whether it appeals is all that matters; and that is superb - enhancing any pretentious claims (well looked up, by the way) to a legacy."", 'Equus is such a superlative masculine fragrance.  Recently gifted a bottle to a very outdoorsy action-man friend who’s extremely difficult to shop for and who hates most men’s colognes because he despises anything that smells like “perfume”. Equus however he now adores. Probably because his wife told him it was “sexy in a lumberjack kinda way” yet unpretentious and down to earth.  Equus is one of my favourite woodsy frags. Makes me think of mahogany and freshly marquetry.  Equus could of course just as easily be worn by a woman - after all Bois des Iles, Samsara and Fémininité du Bois all shattered the convention of woods being masculine.', ""Bright woody citrus, tart, dry, and aromatic. For 30$ it feels acceptable, however it falls apart on my skin fairly quickly to reveals some woody base notes and some clean, linen like musk with moderate longevity as a skin scent. Not a life changing fragrance, but if you are looking for a fresh, bright woody casual scent this won't disappoint."", ""I've had a bottle of this ever since it was launched. My take on this is that it smells medicinal and dries down to a balm-like effect (the vetiver comes through though). I understand how this is polarizing, but to me it's a love, although admittedly not something I would wear often. Moderate performance, but I think if anyone tried to make it stronger it would lose it's delicate balance. Some perfumes are like that. Coppermann also created Bois d'Iris (Van Cleef), which has a similar delicate balance (different notes of course), and which is a favourite of mine. Hers is a very refined taste."", 'I get fresh spicy pencil shavings', 'On first impression this is a basic fresh woody fragrance. I mostly get citrus, light floral and cedar. It’s nice. I find it to be similar to Givenchy pour homme red label. Will update with more time.', 'If Equus was branded by a niche fragrance it would be sold around 250 euros ! I watched a reviewyoutube on Marco 4 U Perfumes and decided to order it ,I am so happy, 30 box for this quality fragrance!', 'This is a bit of a one dimensional sequoia scent, but it is very well done and unique in its detailed recreation of this particular wood. It is a go-to cold weather casual scent for me—great for flannel shirts, heavy wool sweaters, etc. Very masculine, tasteful, understated. Great value as with most of the Lalique line', 'Purchased blind from a discounter in EDT concentration - based on my experience with Lalique Lion I expect the EDT to have more citrusy brightness and less Iso E Super. Happily the bottle has the horse head in relief, not the newer etched bottle. And it leaves me headache free so the EDT gamble pays out.  Extremely green, slightly sour juniper over pencil shavings and spices. The green and herbal gourmand notes have a savoury quality that can be a little off putting over time. I spray it on my wrists and not my chest. The cedar/juniper/nutmeg gives me strong deja vu for some 2000s Burberry scents, but nicheified here, less identifiable as “cologne”.  The niche-y uniqueness is de rigueur for Lalique. Among their masculines this is a riskier blind buy than the easy-pleasing Lion and Hommage, but ahead of the Encre Noire’s. A springtime forest hike in the Pacific Northwest. Natural, youthful, masculine. Update: I also hiiighly recommend trying this before spending the $$ on Byredo’s Eleventh Hour…', ""I describe Equus as a walk through a high-end horse stable, with just fresh hay and no horses, but idealized with a sprinkle of sugar dust. Also that it's a more affordable, everyday-wear sport version of Creed Royal Oud. So when the new King is coronated he wears Royal Oud. The next day when the King makes his appearance at the polo match, or equestrian show, he wears Lalique Pour Homme Equus. I like Equus better than Encre Noir. And Equus has very little similarity to Oscar for Men (1999), which is a very underrated, spicy citrus fragrance that, in addition to not being boring, was a precursor to both later releases of David Beckham Instinct and Terre d'Hermes.  I have the 3-dimensional etched glass bottles of all three Lalique Pour Homme fragrances."", 'It takes quite a few, few sprays to get any action outta this stuff.. Love the cedar(ish) woods. That is what its all about.  Released around the same time, this reminds me a lot like Oscar for Men, Oscar de Larenta 1999 (the one in frosted bottle) ...which was about the most boring, office-safe fragrance I ever did own. The Equus has more wood notes though. Still searching for a CeDaR-BoMb with some major durability  ---this newer reformulation of Equus is downright terrible. I used a whole bottle in under a month. Conclusion: I have decanted an entire bottle and added cedarwood oil, lemon, cardamom and a few drops of mace. It lasts over a few hours now and still smells the same.', ""To my nose this has some shared DNA with Lalique Pour Homme (lion) EDP. It has a sparkly zing in its opening that is very interesting. It's targeted to younger men in compare to Lion EDP. I personally prefer the lion; it has a deeper character in it that it doesn't feel as strong in this one. Don't get me wrong, this is a great fragrance. Also, the sequoia note in this is very interesting; not to mention also very unique. Overall, it's an awesome release and highly recommended. P.S. it has some similarities to Bvlgari Man in Black in the air to my nose."", ""I love Quorum Silver and TDH so I figured I would like this one. So nice. I agree with some of the comments that this can take you to a horse farm (in a good way). It's refined, woody, and green without being old. I will wear it in the Spring and Fall with great joy."", 'I have new bottle of this with horse head painted over the bottle. I got this as a promotion offer for another order for £12 so I took it. Now what I am really surprised of is the fact that no one listed or mentioned that this is nearly 1:1 copy of Armani eau de Cedre, or should I say Armani is copy of Equus as Lalique was first. When I got this and first sprayed on my forearm I said: ""This is Eau de Cedre"". I also have original Gucci pour homme II (also I). I can get why some people see some similarities because of tea and violet leaf, but that\'s it. Dry down is completely different to my nose. Even take a look at the notes. 1 Head Armani: Bergamot, lemon, sage Equus: Bergamot, lemon, citron 2 Middle Armani: Violet leaf, cardamom, cumin Equus: Violet leaf, cardamom, nutmeg, mace, juniper, Brazilian redwood 3 Base Armani: Black tea, cedar essence, suede, woody notes Equus: Sequoia, vetiver, benzoin, amyris, leather, musk And these actually reflect perfectly how I smell them. Both open with citrussy fresh vibe but Armani has minty airy vibe of sage, where Equus has citrus mixed with juniper. After a while Armani is still lighter and you can smell the cardamom aromatic vibe, with sweet vibe of cumin. Equus is even more aromatic with added more spicy warmth from nutmeg and mace and resin/amber feel like from juniper and redwood (juniper is still strong at this stage). Now dry down is woody and aromatic in both. Armani is more green woods because of black tea. Cedar essence note gives really strong pungent vibe of resin conifers. Sequoia with benzoin and amyris gives nearly same experience. Vetiver here gives little bit earthy feeling but also green grassy like. Armani is smoothed out by some woody notes with suede on later dry down. Equus has leather with musk. This is how I find suede: it\'s leather note with white musk added for softer vibe. Overall these are very, very close in terms of vibe however Armani is much more well blended and last longer. It\'s one of my favourite scents for spring and summer as I am not big fan of citrussy freshies. It\'s also much lighter scent and more uplifting. I would say it\'s more herbal/aromatic and woody where Equus is more woody spicy/aromatic. I recommend to check anyone who has them both.', ""Even though the bottle was depictured as the older one with the relief horse, I received the newer one with the flat motif. People say there was a reformulation as well, so my review is for the newer version.  Equus pour Homme is a fresh, outgoing scent, but not harsh. It has a green vibe, herbal and fruity, without going sweet. The opening is quite citrussy, but the drydown shines with juniper, cardamom and notes of wood and vetiver.The lemon is still there, but it's not dominating the fragrance anymore.  It evokes pictures of strolling across the pasture on a warm summer evening. The sun has been shining all day and now the vegetation exudes all its wonderful scents. Even though, I have these pictures of nature in my mind, Equus is sophisticated, very pleasant and good quality. I can see this being a good fit in any kind of situation. I bought the EdP for my partner, but might just be reaching for it from time to time. I'm not normally into male scents for myself and in my perception this is unmistakably one, but I just like its vibe so much. Considering the price (around 25 EUR for 75ml), I'd say this is quite the safe blind buy."", '7.5/10 Scent = 2.5/3 Performance = 1/3 Wearability = 3/3 Value = 1/1 To me, this scent reminds me of some (black? +peppermint?) tea with honey. It is sweet and fresh at the same time. The scent stays close to the skin (is intimate), performance is the worst thing about this fragrance. But the quality is outstanding. It is a calming, self-soothing scent that gives a Midsummer vibe. I can see why people mention the country side – it smells like that.', ""An awesome classy fresh yet woody spicy fragrance in fact that's an understatement it is a truly regal scent.The spices mix with the vibrant luminous citruses to give off an almost fizz or effervescence and in combination with the strong woods gives a aristocratic presence.Apparently it is similar to Creeds Spice and Wood which I am not sure of but I know one thing this is a quality scent."", ""This was a real disappointment. I'm guessing this was recently reformulated because I got really terrible performance which my bottle which kind of ruined the fragrance for me. I'm not even a guy that cares too much about performance but when you only get 2-3 hours of longevity and pretty much no projection of scent you actually like it's disappointing, to say the least.  The scent itself was also kind of let down but only because I had really high expectations based on reviews I saw said that it smelled like a butsudan. Sorry to say but the newest batches don't come close to that kind of rich woodsy smell. I actually really enjoy the scent as a whole but I guess my expectations were way too high to be impressed on the initial spray.  The opening however I'm not a huge fan of as I got mostly hay and black pepper kind of smell. It quickly dried down to be more green and the dry down is fantastic on this scent. I find this to be a casual spring-fall scent. A scent you wear when you don't feel like wearing a scent as it is really intimate and earthy smelling. I haven't worn this in warm and hot weather yet so hopefully, the warmer weather helps the performance. The scent itself I would give a 7 or 8/10 but the performance is like a 2/10 making it a 5/10 overall. Pretty disappointed. I'll still wear it though."", ""Unpopular Opinion: I have both the older Engraved Horse EDP, and also the newer Cartoon Horse EDP, and I like the scent of the newer version much better. They are very similar, and I will wear and enjoy them both, but the newer version is just nicer to me. It's a touch less heavy and maybe a bit more modern. Performance of my two bottles is about the same (which is, not great)."", ""This is lovely, again Lalique doesn't disappoint! It's fresh, grassy, hay-like and herbal, I can smell the citron cardamom and mace, and I can detect the vetiver giving a good base. I think there's leather too but it's the idea of leather, not in-your-face, just enough to give this a classic equus vibe like other perfumes in this genre but not over the top. Somewhere horse tack has been but not the horse itself-- just a little animalic. Enough musk underneath to keep it interesting, too. It's not your usual men's cologne, I dare say this isn't going to be popular with the usual fruity young men's crowd that's popular these days. I keep going back to my wrist for more, it's delightful. My only demerit is for the tacky and cheap bottle-- they have really downgraded the presentation on this! The one I got has a cheesy looking cartoon horse etched into the back surface of the bottle. The cap is cheap too and it almost broke the second time I opened it. Too bad, at least the juice inside is good!"", 'This horsey bottle comes with its own fresh hay scent. Very nice fragrance that keeps you feeling positive in a good energy way. Smell of open log cabin.....very country.', ""Spicy woods. Reminds me a bit of mulled wine. I mainly get the mace and cardamom spices mixed with the woody elements of juniper, vetiver and sequoia . It's a bit more of a sharper woodiness. It doesn't have a great strength, and it is moderately priced. It is unique and a nice change from the typical blue or citrus men's colognes. It is very autumnal, wintery and outdoorsy, but it is understated so can also be quite formal. UPDATE: Kind of a sour woods. I don't use it often because I prefer smokier woods."", 'Bought a Decant. This smells very similar to Zwitsal, the baby oil that I used when I am still in kindergarden. Not for me', ""I'm normally not super interested in citrusy scents, but this one I really wanted, because it makes me smile and fills me with energy. A scent that makes sad days better.  If Lalique Encre Noire is dark, rainy nights in a bottle, Lalique Equus is the opposite, sunny days and joy in a bottle"", ""A perfect autumnal fragrance. A little citrus to keep it bright and fresh, and a lot of woods to keep it hearty and cozy. There's a bit of sweetness in it too to keep it a bit on the sexy side. A little more modern than Lion. I honestly love the scent, but it's longevity is a huge short coming. I need to reapply every 4 hours, which for the price isn't a deal breaker. I highly recommend, just don't be afraid to go heavy and reapply as needed."", 'Equus smells (a lot) like a butsudan, the household shrine you find in Japanese homes and triggers flashbacks of cedar, mahogany, red sandalwood, and Palisander rosewood, even though none of these are present. Juniper, redwood, sequoia and amyris (aka ""West Indian sandalwood"") are the actual woods in this, with vetiver and spiced with cardamom, nutmeg and mace, on a resinous foundation of styrax. Fairly linear but if you enjoy woody fragrances this is intoxicating.  The new bottle looks cheap and nasty compared to the original whose horse looked three dimensional, and closer in style to the frosted crystal glasswork for which Lalique is famous. Presumably a cost-cutting measure, since the original bottles must have been expensive to produce - and in commercial perfumery bottles generally cost more to manufacture than their contents. Quite possibly the ultimate woody fragrance - Equus feels more wondrously woody than Wonderwood. A legend that is rightly regarded as a modern classic men’s fragrance.', ""Blind buy based on reviews (thank you!). Blown away by how brilliantly unique this beautiful fragrance is. Initially and very quickly you pick up on the sharp vetiver and sequoia notes dancing with the citrus. It then begins settling down into a spicier, more grounded, even earthier tone. As it calms it gets a bit boozier. Think spiced rums with orange peel - but it isn't soft. It maintains an edge, like a squeeze of lime was thrown in for good measure and the rum you chose was the spiciest they had. As it begins to dry down you start getting more of the cardamom, musk and benzoin with that citrus layer softening.  Longevity is fairly good, lasts most of the day but it does soften quickly. I see this being a go to for spring and autumn, or balmy summer nights to give a bit more of a blast for people sniffing me. Unique, beautiful and a new ongoing one for my collection."", 'It opens with a lemon or tangerine peel near the fireplace. Edgy and a bit smoky. Later you can distinguish the different lighter additives like juniper or violet. At the most it stays woody with burned leathery nuance. It is a nice scent , very dependent on the weather conditions. Good one! At least man pays more for less in the bottle nowadays!!!', 'I adore Equus on a cold Autumn morning when the sillage mixes with the scent of the new day and the smell burning wood stoves wafting through the air. Equus has the ability on me to bring to mind all the wonderful little details of the season that might otherwise go unnoticed in the daily grind.  I have had my bottle (EdP) for almost four years and it just keeps getting better with each passing year, such a beautiful fragrance and a steal at the price you can get it for.', ""Best fragrance I've ever smelled. No joke! I finaly found my signature fragrance!!"", 'I quite like Lalique Pour Homme so blind bought this one. Similar but more of a new leather and tobacco aroma that offers enough to be well worth buying even if you already have Pour Homme. Not an overly strong lasting scent but very nice.', 'If you ever opened a new pack of cigarettes and took a whiff of it, then you are close to knowing how Equus smells. This however is surrounded by citrus and slight sweetness. Tobacco scent without tobacco note. Excellent. Projection is weak after 2 hours; but stays long time (EDP).', 'WOW!! This is full on completely love at first sniff! I find it difficult to pick out specific notes. Though I get a fresh hay-ish note which goes with the horse theme. It is a super smooth fresh-like and elegant fragrance that you would expect from a mature, well off man dressed up in full riding outfit in the stables. Reminds me of a mellowed down smooth Spicebomb.

Decent performance on my skin....so far. LOVE !!!!!!!!"", 'Okay, I get the hamster bedding reference that some people mention. But wait 15 mins (after the wet opening) and you will be drawn into a more rich and deep wood-note. One of the reviews below said that they smell a similarity between this and Gucci Guilty Absolute.

That being said, If you own neither Equus EDP or GGA, I would go for the Gucci Guilty Absolute over Equus.', 'هذا العطر قد لا يعجب الكثيرين وانا منهم، حقيقة الرائحة غريبة ومختلفة ولكن ليس بصورة ايجابية، فيه رائحة في العطر مزعجة..  العطر كلاسيكي واصداره في ٢٠٠١، مختلف عن اخوه الآخر رأس الأسد، العطر الآخر حمضي كلاسيكي، هذا مختلف تماماً عن الآخر.. فقط اللي احب أقوله وأكد عليه، جرب العطر قد لا يعجبك واياني واياك تشتريه عمياني، حتى لو سعره رخيص أراه لا يستحق وجهة نظري المتواضعة.. اللهم هل بلغت؟ اللهم فأشهد..', 'EDT is a very nice woody scent, lots of cedar-like depth, slight natural sweetness that is dry and not cloying. Slight tobacco note in the opening, dry down has a surprising coolness to it despite remaining in the cedar realm (although the note is likely the sequoia.) I have the EDT and the EDP. EDT is nice for spring, will have to see how it will do in summer, but it is overall an airier and cooler version, versus the EDP which is richer and warmer. EDP might be better in winter, but I will have to wait to try that out. Overall unique- I’ve not smelled anything similar aside from actual wood shavings. I do not get hamster with this aside from hamster cages using wood shavings; nothing rodent-like about the fragrance itself. (I don’t get any similarity with my Bois de Vetiver unfortunately!)', 'This smells EXACTLY like Karl Lagerfeld Bois de Vetiver, but a tad less sweet. It is a bit more closer to the skin and a bit more smooth. If this one is a bit too smooth/subtle for your taste, try Karl Lagerfeld Bois de Vetiver. You will be pleasantly surprised.', ""This was a blind buy since I love oriental woody and spicy woody fragrances, and I'm quite the fan of mahogany. It certainly didn't disappoint, it's similar to Hugo Boss BOSS Bottled, quite similar quite spicy and woody. Gorgeous fragrance very happy with it, if your thinking about it then don't just buy it. The citrus top works in well and the spices aren't sickling either well balanced and quite classy. And the woodiness is there also super good."", ""Oh yes. One of those scents that takes you somewhere when you take a whiff. The rain has just stopped, the ground is damp and I am walking through haystacks with the sound of cows and chickens nearby... This stuff is amazing! Also - I got the EDP, and the bottle is still engraved with that depth into the bottle, it's beautiful."", ""At long last, something has filled the Gucci Pour Homme II shaped hole in my heart, and I'm overjoyed. Unfortunately, Equus is missing that addictive black tea note from GPHII, as well as a bit of the cinnamon smoothness, but the resemblance is still striking. A homerun from Lalique, typical solid quality considering the price. Also, the bottle is gorgeous! Love the engraving."", 'Amazing! So different than other fragrances around. Lalique never disappoint! Fist time i thought i EDT is better than EDP. After giving some more time on the EDP, i start liking it more! Anyone should try this for spring.', ""I blind bought this based on the note breakdown after buying Encre Noire and Encre Noire Sport and being really impressed by the brand. After wearing Equus a couple of times, I bought 2 more backup bottles. I love this stuff. To provide some perspective, I'm not a fan of the typical summer citrus scents. They tend to have poor performance and they all smell pretty similar which makes them boring. Basically if you've smelled one you've smelled them all. I'm also not a fan of the modern trend toward sweet fragrances for men. Call me a middle aged old man but to me, men are supposed to smell like woods and leather and smoke and the great outdoors, not bubblegum and grape soda and flowers. Also, the sweet stuff is sort of sickening after a while. But I'm also a fan of Fahrenheit, Kouros, Quorum, One Man Show, Bentley Absolute, Gucci Guilty Absolute, and Bvlgari Man Black Orient. Take that for whatever it's worth. So I was thrilled with Encre Noire Sport. That's a wearable summer option that no one will confuse with a unisex fragrance. When I saw the note breakdown for Equus and an EDP concentration, I had high hopes that this would be another winner from Lalique.  Wow! This is a home run for me. This has become my signature scent for spring, summer, and fall. There is nothing sweet here. Yeah, there's some citrus in the opening but that is NOT what this fragrance is about. And forget about picking out individual notes. It's an experience. It feels like you've just come in from the horse barn after spreading fresh hay in hot weather. It feels like you're walking up a mountain trail just after snow melt in the spring. It feels like fall right before the leaves drop and you're cutting spruce with a chainsaw. It does NOT smell like something your girlfriend or wife will want to borrow. As for performance, It's moderate. I get about 5-6 hours. But projection and sillage drop pretty fast after about an hour. That's fine for me. I don't need beast mode and it makes Equus more wearable. I can always replenish if I want. Quality is super high. There is nothing cheap or synthetic smelling here. At the price you can get this at discounters this is another steal from Lalique."", 'Oh my lord what a wonderful unique hidden gem this is! I managed to get a bottle with the engraved / etched horse and the reviews below have certainly been more accurate than expected.  It has that wonderful semi damp straw / wood smell that you get in a horse stable, I cannot relate to the so called hamster smell as I have never had one.  This would be a splendid Spring scent through and through the citrus opening starts full on but lingers through the mid nicely to the dry down. Rocobar by Hermés smells slightly similar (which is a big compliment) but it does not have the strong citrus and juniper notes that this has, the dry down here is just gorgeous.  I would see this as day time casual wearing fragrance, perfect for smart casually dressed man.  Although it has deeper notes, it manages to stay fresh and clean so very impressed.', ""I love this blend of juniper and cardamon, which reminds me of Hermes d'Voyage. However I understand that my EDP is a pale reformulation of some previous gorgeous fragrance (the colour of which was pinkish comparing to its reformulation).  I mark it as unisex fragrance as I wear masculine woody fragrances. This one is not heavy at all, there is a breeze in it.  In the Baltic online shops you still can get the flacon with an engraved horse head. But on the Lalique site it is already redesigned. What a shame to redesign a perfect classical flacon!!

But I love the fragrance itself, far more than I expected to. It's fresh like a forest, yet spicy. Clean, brisk, wonderful, so unlike anything else I have. Great for waking the senses yet relaxing. One of my favorites. Does not smell like a horse, and I don't associate forest smells like the cedar and spices with horses at all. A horsey smell could be great: leather, hay, molasses, and horse sweat. But this is not like that. Equus is super super fresh and spicy. The bottle is gorgeous and so is the scent. Lalique never disappoints."", ""Amazing fragrance! Elegant, Classy and Sophisticated. The scent is spicy- woody but is not heavy. This perfume has a well-balanced composition .

Edit: Equus is the father of Spicebomb and Bvlgari In Black"", 'Smells like ointment that you use to rub on sore muscles...probably because of the mace note, which give this a very menthol-y aroma.

The pepper in this smells so freshly ground(I love pepper as a note). But what I found interesting was that at times if I put my nose to my arm I wouldn't smell anything but at other times when I was going about my day, I got whiffs of woods and pepper.

The reviewer below me mentioned Tonka Imperiale and Spiriteuse by Guerlain- this all just goes to show this is a very very high quality smelling fragrance. This may be the best cheap blind buy I’ve ever made. Also, I really like the bottle.', ""I purchased this perfume (Lalique Equus EDP) for my husband and when he wore it, it reminded me of something between Guerlain Spiritueuse Double Vanille and Tonka Imperiale. Spicy, oriental and unisex. Dries down to a soft, spicy, resinous, warm scent with moderate projection. Better suited to cooler weather in fall/winter. I'll be keeping an eye on this one. Equus has that familiar DNA that I found in other Lalique fragrances. That vetiver/lavender/vanilla/pepper that I sense in Satine, Living and somewhat in Mon Guerlain. If you like that corner of perfumery, then you'll appreciate this one. In the end, I took this from my husband. It's more my style of perfume ;)."", ""Beautiful bottle, looks great with the right lighting around it. As for the fragrance, it's nice, fresh & rural.

It\'s more airy than I expected and this quality makes it signature-scent worthy and suitable all year-round. The juniper note, which gives a fizzy,gin & tonic smell with berry undertones is actually the most prominent player to my nose. For some reason, this part of the scent causes a small gag-reflex for me. The saving grace was the so-called ""hamster-cage"" smell that others below have mentioned but sadly, it\'s never in the forefront of the EDT. I wish it was because that exotic ""sequoia"" wood smell is so unique and addicting - I hope it\'s more prominent in the EDP.

(Emilie Bevierre Coppermann, 2001) Scentrack: Jakatta – The Other World In my opinion Lalique is one of the most underappreciated fragrance houses. Lalique always delivers well-composed imaginative creations for a good price. Just to mention Encre Noire, Hommage a l’Homme, Hommage a l’Homme Voyageur, Perles, Amethyst, Ombre Noire... Yes, performance is sometimes subpar, but no one could deny their timeless beauty and sophistication. Equus is the typical story of Lalique fragrance. Launched too early, nicely polished, reminiscent of a classic era and completely under the radar. It opens with a certain Asian citrus touch that almost immediately transforms in spice cabinet nutmeg and cardamom. This introduction is rounded by juniper with gin qualities and just a hint of green violet leaf. Then gradually morphs in woody phase characterized by the guitar rosewood, subtle vetiver and musk. In the base there is also a touch of gentle powder. The most impressive is the connection between the name and the composition. From the first smell Equus transported me way back in the past, directly in the circus. Although it is clean, polite and well groomed, underneath the surface is a funky animal hidden note, probably by the usage of some woods. Equus is very natural smelling composition. Relaxing as a walk through a peaceful forest on a sunny day. The sun is muted by ancient trees, but still bright enough to enjoy the walk. A composition that came out too early. Later this theme will be relaunched in a denser way inside Spicebomb and Bvlgari Man in Black. It has some qualities of radiant Perles, but still, it is not its male counterpart. A beautiful woodsy fougere that confirms my theory that 2000s were the most creative years for perfumes. Rating: 7/10', 'یکی از کارای خوب و کمیاب لالیک. بوی چوب همراه با کمی شیرینی چونیپر. بوی چوبش حس بوی درخت کاج رو میده. پخش و ماندگاری متوسط', ""I have the EDP. I detected moderate to heavy pepper upon initial sprays that reminded me of Lalique White, though I don't recall pepper being a note listed for Equus. The pepper remains through dry down to skin scent with citrus as a minor player. Like many others, I also sense the hay and cedar upon dry down and skin scent mode. A faint whisper of violet upon deep inhalation. Minimal sillage and projection on my skin. I would absolutely not worry about over spraying this and in all seriousness, that may be required for even minimal projection. Unfortunately, this will be located near the back of my collection due to the overly strong pepper I sense."", ""Lalique Pour Homme Equus is an aromatic gourmand. It opens with a mellow sweet bakery spice, combined with deep woods that add strong character and sophistication. It is a masculine feel-good aroma. The touch of spices is very comforting. I think the equilibrium is prime—in that it feels mature—but isn't dated or entirely vintage in any way. It's a modern mature feeling that it gives off. I do get a subtle resemblance to Spicebomb. It's certainly there, but the fragrance has so much unique quality about it you can't entirely make that relation. Mace is certainly the key player. It has a cinnamon-ish essence—with a hayish character to it. The juniper berries add a bit of tartness to the aroma—it furthers the sophistication in my opinion. Not a bad touch at all. I think Lalique are experts at making fragrances that are simple, yet sweet—and this would definitely be another fancy offering of that sort. Certainly worth every bit of the $20.00 dollars you'll pay for it on the gray market. I can't say that it begins to be worth the $115.00 dollars asked for on the official Lalique website though.  One thing is certain: It is enjoyable—a lady pleaser even. Anyone looking for something simple and sweet and unique, should find this one easy to include in their rotation.

Alone, this would make for a very interesting and polarizing niche fragrance. But what the designer has done here is knock that woodsiness down a couple of pegs and warm it up with just enough spice (nutmeg, mace, cardamom) and benzoin to round its edges nicely. To this, she also added a potent balance of citrus that puts a very clean and natural lemon in the lead for a good while. The result of this alchemy is something that is light, fresh and airy for a wood-forward scent, but that lingers longer than you might think.

""Equus"" is a very fitting name. This is something reminiscent to a horse stall, like Gucci Guilty Absolute, but it goes in a different direction that I personally can\'t appreciate.

A beautiful, year-round scent evoking a certain rural sophistication and charm.', 'In my never ending quest for high quality woods, I turned to Lalique. It is quite dynamic. Initially sweetish, spicy and cedary, it dries down to a spicy sandalwood that is quite lovely. Smells favorably in quality to Bois de Portugal, though the profile is different. The weakness is in sillage. I get 3 hours on skin and that’s right up close. Stays with clothes—and beautifully—for 12 hours but again up close only. But Equus is off the charts for quality/value.

The cardamom and impression of leather fades and develops into a soft and fresh spiced wood that some hours later - first sprayed at night and still present the next morning - changes into a sweet and balsamic resinous scent. Lalique Equus is definitely for the over-30s and could be worn for most occasions, day or night; noticeable but not obnoxious for the office and intriguing for evening wear or a date. Very few perfumers make non-linear fragrances these days - a perfume that really evolves as you wear it - but I’m glad Lalique is one of them because they do it damned well.', 'Another winner from Lalique! really love this one. find it sufficiently sophisticated and understated that it can work in the office, but the woods and spices scream to be worn outdoors. very well blended and very good longevity on my skin. the citrus evaporates quickly to the aforementioned woods and spices that create a very addictive sillage that makes me continuously sniff my wrist.', ""I have been waiting to try this one, since a lot of people suggested me to try this one when I was looking for a cedar-dominant fragrance (I know this one is sequoia based, but many say it is similar). Well, in my case, I get mostly juniper (which I have found I really dislike, too astringent to my nose) with some spices, I get cinnamon, which reminds me of Spicebomb (could be the nutmeg). Once it dries down, you're left with sweet spices and some woodyness in the background. I get about 4 hours with soft projection, which is fine, since Equus is quite cheap. In the end, this is not for me, smells a bit mature for me and quite cheap. However, if you are a manly man in his 30's-40's, do check it out, it could be a nice day/work scent."", ""Equus is the best spicy woody fragrance I've tried. It feels grown-up. More sophisticated. Somehow less mass-produced. More like a creation from the mind of a talented artisan. Not sure what sequoia smells like, but the combination of woods, leather, violet leaf and spice notes exude quality at every stage. The sillage and longevity seem unremarkable for an EdP. In both respects one can't help but wonder if this is a permanent legacy of IFRA. Heavy application doesn't make an obvious improvement. I would describe it as average in this respect. For comparisons, there are vague suggestions of Gucci PH 2 and surprisingly perhaps Dior Fahrenheit Le Parfum (deep into its dry down) no doubt because they are rich in the commonality of violet leaf which in the case of Equus is a heavenly presence throughout. The bottle has a decent heft with a contrasting frosted horse head emblem recessed within the clear casted glass flacon. It looks classy. The gold crenelated lid appears threaded and heavy but is in fact a light and strong plastic that is removed by a simple pull. Whilst well received when worn, I feel this EdP is compromised by it's sillage and longevity - though I acknowledge the experience of others differs. The scent itself is nothing less than excellent, and the current online price represents good value. Definitely recommendable."", ""Spicy Woody Goodness I'm surprised to find a lot of people complaining about the longevity of this fragrance.

It is a soothing scent. Yet it does have a transitional character, feels a bit incomplete. It is Two Towers to White's Return of the King. On its own it stands as an atypical spicy woody scent that could have been one of Etro's. A decently nice scent that is comforting and easy to wear. As number three in the line it is the logical and excellent connection of Le Faune with White. ***(**)"", ""This is ok at best but nothing to write home about. It begins with a very nice smelling citrus (bergamot mainly) blend with a faint peppery undertone. But on the drydown (within a few minutes) the scent becomes one of realistic wood accord (I'm guessing this is the sequoia) with sweet nutmeg and violet leaf. The overall impression oddly is of a cappaccino. After a while, it ends up smelling like vanilla-musk but with violet leaf (it's very boring to my nose and I'm not a huge fan). There are some notes I absolutely love in all their incarnations (like neroli) while others I just plain cannot stand if they are too prominent - and violet leaf is one of them. Hence, I'm not a huge fan of this fragrance. Sillage is moderate as is longevity (on the lower end for a eau de parfum). People who love wood colognes will probably like this a lot.

It also smells a bit like crayons, and a bit like pencil shavings - there is a woody/plastic aspect to it but overall it actually smells very natural.  Good for casual wear - an artistic, laid back fragrance. I would not wear to serious occasions - this is too woodsy and rustic.

At certain times when I wear this, the nutmeg and cardamom become prominent, lending depth and warmth to the composition. Just enough leather to toughen it up, but balanced by the violet leaf so it isn’t rugged. Mountain high-country-classy: you wear cowboy boots, but those $2000 hand-stitched pair of Luccheses ain’t ever kicked a pile of cow sh**. Oh, no sir.

Overall, a scent good for the fall and feels like it fits best outdoors. A scent for a hike in the fall foliage in New England or upstate New York.  A few said it smells like a hamster cage. Can't deny the similarities as hamster bedding is often simply wood shavings (and Equus definitely is wood-dominant, especially in the dry down). But that comes off as very negative and this is a pleasant overall scent.  A 7/10 for me. Good buy if you have $30 to spend and want something for the fall that'll be a great match to your Barbour jacket and Chelsea boots."", 'Lalique Pour Homme Equus ... A special serene fragrance that has become something of an escape for me. I visualize an 18th century South American plantation home in a mountainous forest overlooking the ocean.

Civilized and unique, yet very natural. I find Equus the most uplifting and pleasing of all Laliques. The downside is this eau-de-parfum does not feel any stronger than most of my EDTs.

Will give it an extra dimension."", ""Another winner from Lalique. Equus is a spicy, woody fragrance. The sequoia note is very prominent and natural smelling. This is a unique fragrance due to the sequoia base, sets it apart from wood notes you usually encounter like cedar. Longevity is good for me. Projection is on the light side but it's noticeable throughout the day."", ""Unpleasant concoction which smells like a chicken, capsicum and basil salad.  This juice is an absolute travesty. No self-respecting human being should want to smell like this. I imagine there are straight guys who mistakenly believe it could be good/masculine to smell like this, rather than smelling of flowers. Wrong. Women don't want you to smell like savoury rice."", ""The opening is dominated initally by an oil paint and turpentine smell - and the impression of pepper. Whatever citrus is there is understated and is just smoothing off the introduction rather than giving an opening blast. This gives way to mostly vetiver in the heart, and the dry down is woody.  This is a very non-linear scent. It's very complex, very earthy but refined, and I would say very masculine, owing mostly to the prominent vetiver. The evergreen notes are gorgeous - all deep smelling, nothing anywhere near the air freshener piney type. It reminds me of my grandad, who is a painter and a carpenter, and smoked rollups. Oil paints, tobacco, and cut wood from a deep forest."", ""This smells exactly like being on a newly-built cedar deck overlooking a fern-carpeted valley under a pine forest canopy after a rain shower while sipping a gin and tonic from the well-oiled saddle of your recently shampooed horse. Everybody's been there, right? ;) In other words, a really unique scent - if you enjoy fragrances that give you a specific experience, and you think you'd enjoy the experience above, run don't walk to get a bottle of this. I agree with gedlive's comment below - this is an exceptional cedar/woody-aromatic that will reallyshine in cool-to-cold weather, it's an obscenely good deal. Lalique strikes again."", ""To me this smells like trees in a forest mixed with petrol and pepper. It is actually quite sweet and its longevity is 8hrs on my skin. It certainly does not smell cheap, in fact very unique. In my opinion it is the 'colder' version of lalique white, they smell similar but this one has more depth. Overall 8/10"", 'Smells like stale cigarettes. If you are not a smoker then people will think you are if you wear this. Gave me a headache.', ""I've had this one for a few weeks now and I have to say I wasn't a huge fan at first. It has however grown on me. Its a comforting smell that has something to it that seems just slightly feminine to me. for that reason, i don't wear it out very often. That said, it really has grown on me a lot. sometimes I'll just spray just a bit on my wrist before bed."", ""After use this one... whatever is happening = make me crazy amorist ❤❤❤ it  Thank you @mojtaba.. It's kind of you which I have it again --------------------------------------- عجیب حس و حال چوبی و اسپایسی باحال و خوش کیفیت این عطر من رو به وجد میاره و دیوانه وار متمایل به بوییدن مکرر میکنه.. بسیار بسیار دوست داشتنی و نایاب"", ""Another great Lalique fragrance.  Equus is woody, crisp, fresh, and light.  This is one of the ideal scents you'd want to be wearing as a man on a beautiful summer day. The best way I can describe this scent is to imagine you're walking down a path next to the ocean. There are large trees around and the wind is blowing slightly. It's about 2pm in the afternoon. You're wearing a white cotton collared button down and youre with your woman who's wearing a straw hat, also wearing white. You're just waking, enjoying the landscape, laughing and being; you feel free. That's what equus is to me. Maybe to Lalique it's the feeling of riding a horse and having the wind blow past you and all the scents that are captured in the air. 10/10.. could be worn spring, summer, fall. Summer will be ideal I imagine."", 'I have a bottle with a few sprays missing if anyone is interested in a swap. It smells good, just not for me.', 'Equus is my favorite frag from Lalique. I used to think He Wood Rocky Mountain was comparible to Equus, but now after 200 reviews and mostly a niche collection, I have gotten rid of He Wood, and continue to grow in my appreciation of Equus; the best woody floral I can think of. The woods are very realistic, the amyris, sequoia, and other woody notes, then I get violet leaf and musk. The other notes are nuances, the nutmeg and cardomom add some nice spiciness. Very unique and well blended. If this is getting disscontinued it will be missed, and prices will go up, as we try to get the remaining bottles on ebay... Yes, this reminds me of Creed Spice and Wood that sells for $1,000/ bottle. I did a side by side this morning, comparing Spice and Wood with Equus. Spice and wood may be the best cedar scent in the world, as Creed Boise du Portugal has the best sandalwood. They are most similar because of the stark, realistic woodiness. Spice and wood has a bit of apple and bergamot to brighten the woods and a bit of spice, very simple beautifull fragrance. Equus has that stark woodiness I like in colder weather, yet the composition, with the violet leaf, nutmeg, mace, and some benzoin richness, I think Equus may be the better, more enjoyable scent. Performance and quality are better with Spice and Wood. I would like to get Spice and Wood someday to cap off my collection, maybe when I retire... Rating: 9/10 Merry Christmas. John 3:16', 'Three words...amazing, fantastic, Unique!', 'This one of my favorites from Lalique and if it is discontinued I need to start restocking on it. Awesome fragrance for anytime and any season.', 'DISCONTINUED!! Sadness...', 'Rockstar..!! Different and unique – definitely a “best kept secret” in the fragrance community. The blend of juniper, floral, and woodsy notes of Lalique’s Pour Home Equus is fantastic. I will also add that it is so different/unique, I find it addictive – I am routinely lifting my arm, hoping to catch a lingering hint of this beauty that I sprayed on the cuff of my sleeve. While I am a fan of this fragrance, I am somewhat disappointed in the performance. Equus lasted about 4 hours on me and a bit longer on my clothing. After the first hour, projection dissipates to skin level. Geared more for fall and winter wear, Equus is office safe and will be a crowd pleaser. My final tally for this gem is 4.5 stars out of 5. If performance was greater, this could easily fall into the Top 5 fragrances. Regardless, this juice is good - Equus is modestly priced, smells great, and carries a positive aura about it that says, “life doesn’t have to be perfect to be wonderful”… You will notice the confidence when wearing. Highly recommend adding to any collection. Enjoy your day and happy fragrance hunting…', 'Very wood, and very strong (EDP). First blast reminded me of a male version to Cartier Baiser Volé', 'This is one of the absolutely most sexy and elegant scents ever! I am totally in love with this one. This love lasts now some years... Maybe it is so good on a the skin of my bf but then it is a bonus ;) I can´t that imagine woman will not react on this one. She must me an aline then :D Guy if you want to feel sexy, classy, elegant. It is the ONE!', ""The opening smells like you're in a really nice forest, but not a piney one, with a great cologne on. Love it! And that later it just smells like a really nice forest once the fruits wear off. This is my favorite outdoorsy scent, even better than He Wood Rocky Mountain, IMO. The longevity is pretty good which is great because this IS a smell I like to find on my old clothes. That wonderful tree, sap, juniper smell that is perfectly balanced and enjoyable, comforting, like a big hug from a forest. 8.5/10 overall and 10/10 when I factor in the price. Great value as of now."", 'Lalique Equus is a gift to the lover of dark woody scents like the much-lamented Yves Saint Laurent M7. The bottle is heavy and beautiful with the horse head etched deeply into the back of the glass. From the perfume top I get very little citrus and a huge blast of nutmeg. After a short while, the nutmeg recedes a bit (or perhaps my nose adapts to it) and blends with the other spices and violet leaf and strong dark woody notes to give a beautiful and long-lasting heart. I think ""sequoia"" is a reasonable description of this heart, though don\'t think sequoia or redwood trees yield any commercial oils and I hope that these rare and magnificent trees are not cut down for our vanity. Based on Lalique\'s note list, I suspect the ""sequoia"" is a combination of nutmeg, mace, cedar, and amyris (similar to sandalwood), or perhaps the whole mirage is from combined synthetics. Whatever the composition, it is magnificent and unique to my experience. The spicy notes last a remarkably long time, but eventually they do give way to a milder but still rich cedar and benzoin base, with a bit of musk, leather, and vetiver. The base is very nice, but the unusually long-lasting heart is what shines in this work of art. It feels ferocious, contemplative, tenebrous, radiant, earthy, and pure by turns. If you have admired Yves Saint Laurent M7 or Dior Fahrenheit Absolute or any other dark woody scent, or even think you might admire them, you should sample Lalique Equus.', ""This smells exactly like being on a newly-built cedar deck overlooking a fern-carpeted valley under a pine forest canopy after a rain shower while sipping a gin and tonic from the well-oiled saddle of your recently shampooed horse.

You start enjoying Equus from the moment you open the box, then the bottle and the smell... the mind anticipates and create the illusion that you are already getting the sequoia note (or actually get it, if you have already spray it). That woodsy note is present through all the experience, deserves a full review and provides Equus whit an earthy and balmy odor profile. Yes it's wood, but You know it's a very special one.  Maybe it's me, but in the opening I get a lot of nutmeg and juniper, not the citruses. On the dry down there's no leather or musk note, but the effect is there, the composition get very sensual and some animal, then the citruses and cardamom appear. This is sensual in a very smooth and elegant way. Duration is very good, when you wake up, a little bit of the base is there, not in your wrist, but there it is. Sillage is moderate, but the two fragances I own from Lalique has this thing I really like: hours later a note escape from time to time, you get close to your wrist and nothing, but then again, another note escape. Not for a blind buy, but I strongly recommend the experience. *** Ahora mismo uso LPH Equus y lo que más me gusta es la calidad. Comienzas a disfrutar Equus desde el momento en que abres la caja, luego la botella y el olor... la mente se anticipa y crea la ilusión de que ya estás obteniendo la nota de secuoya (o así es, si ya has utilizado la botella). Esa nota amaderada está presente durante toda la experiencia y merece su propia revisión, al tiempo que le da a Equus un perfil olfativo térreo y balsámico. Sí, es madera, pero sabes que se trata de una muy especial. Quizá sea yo, pero en la apertura percibo mucha nuez moscada y junípero, pero no cítricos. En el secado no hay nota de piel o musk, pero su efecto está ahí. La composición se pone muy sensual y algo animal, entonces aparecen los cítricos y el cardamomo. Es una sensualidad discreta y elegante. La duración es muy buena, cuando despiertas, un poco de la base sigue ahí, no en tu muñeca, pero está ahí. La proyección es moderada, pero las dos fragancias que tengo de Lalique tienen eso que realmente me gusta: horas después una nota escapa de cuando en cuando, te acercas a la muñeca y nada, pero entonces de nuevo, otra nota escapa. No recomiendo una compra a ciegas pero sí y mucho, la experiencia."", ""I blind bought this based on the note breakdown after buying Encre Noire and Encre Noire Sport and being really impressed by the brand. After wearing Equus a couple of times, I bought 2 more backup bottles. I love this stuff. To provide some perspective, I'm not a fan of the typical summer citrus scents. They tend to have poor performance and they all smell pretty similar which makes them boring. Basically if you've smelled one you've smelled them all. I'm also not a fan of the modern trend toward sweet fragrances for men. Call me a middle aged old man but to me, men are supposed to smell like woods and leather and smoke and the great outdoors, not bubblegum and grape soda and flowers. Also, the sweet stuff is sort of sickening after a while. But I'm also a fan of Fahrenheit, Kouros, Quorum, One Man Show, Bentley Absolute, Gucci Guilty Absolute, and Bvlgari Man Black Orient. Take that for whatever it's worth. So I was thrilled with Encre Noire Sport. That's a wearable summer option that no one will confuse with a unisex fragrance. When I saw the note breakdown for Equus and an EDP concentration, I had high hopes that this would be another winner from Lalique.  Wow! This is a home run for me. This has become my signature scent for spring, summer, and fall. There is nothing sweet here. Yeah, there's some citrus in the opening but that is NOT what this fragrance is about. And forget about picking out individual notes. It's an experience. It feels like you've just come in from the horse barn after spreading fresh hay in hot weather. It feels like you're walking up a mountain trail just after snow melt in the spring. It feels like fall right before the leaves drop and you're cutting spruce with a chainsaw. It does NOT smell like something your girlfriend or wife will want to borrow. As for performance, It's moderate. I get about 5-6 hours. But projection and sillage drop pretty fast after about an hour. That's fine for me. I don't need beast mode and it makes Equus more wearable. I can always replenish if I want. Quality is super high. There is nothing cheap or synthetic smelling here. At the price you can get this at discounters this is another steal from Lalique."", ""A very daring fragrance.  For me I get smoke, the dry down of a cedar note and a dry animalisitic note. This fragrance reminds me of a dry, maybe abandoned, ranch that used to have horses or cattle.  I get 4 to 6 hours and projection is moderate light, but the smell is distinctive so I will get more noticed than that.  I cannot think of a appropriate time to wear this besides hiking, camping, or at some replica or presentation for civil war reenactments or the like.  I gave this to my father , who doesn't seem to dislike it.  I would recommend you sample if this smells interesting to you. This is niche in how daring it is, so be warned. Not for me , but the quality is good, like usually for lalique."", 'I\'m going to be one of the many haters of this fragrance, but unfortunately I really dislike it. It reminds me of only ONE thing - HAMSTER CAGE BEDDING! Cedar chips plus urine. I always had hamsters growing up and I just can\'t get past how similar this smells!  However, I will say that I can see why everyone else loves this scent. It smells extremely natural. ""Equus"" is a very fitting name. This is something reminiscent to a horse stall, like Gucci Guilty Absolute, but it goes in a different direction that I personally can\'t appreciate. I wanted to like it too because the sequoia note used is one of my FAVORITE notes! But unfortunately I can\'t appreciate this one at all.  Layers well with Gucci Guilty Absolute, though...  *scratching my chin* ¯|_(ツ)_/¯', ""I have the EDP. I detected moderate to heavy pepper upon initial sprays that reminded me of Lalique White, though I don't recall pepper being a note listed for Equus. The pepper remains through dry down to skin scent with citrus as a minor player. Like many others, I also sense the hay and cedar upon dry down and skin scent mode. A faint whisper of violet upon deep inhalation. Minimal sillage and projection on my skin. I would absolutely not worry about over spraying this and in all seriousness, that may be required for even minimal projection. Unfortunately, this will be located near the back of my collection due to the overly strong pepper I sense."", ""I have been waiting to try this one, since a lot of people suggested me to try this one when I was looking for a cedar-dominant fragrance (I know this one is sequoia based, but many say it is similar). Well, in my case, I get mostly juniper (which I have found I really dislike, too astringent to my nose) with some spices, I get cinnamon, which reminds me of Spicebomb (could be the nutmeg). Once it dries down, you're left with sweet spices and some woodyness in the background. I get about 4 hours with soft projection, which is fine, since Equus is quite cheap. In the end, this is not for me, smells a bit mature for me and quite cheap. However, if you are a manly man in his 30's-40's, do check it out, it could be a nice day/work scent."", ""I have the Encre noir, White and a couple of others from Lalique. Since I love the others and have read everything about this fragrance I blind bought this one. I don't know if this frangance 'simply' is very special. But this one is Definitely not for me.""]"

Lavender and vanilla mingle unapologetically, representing the fluid spectrum of identity, while the almond and amber base notes ground this fragrance in a beautiful state of inclusivity. It’s not “unisex”—a word that reeks of gendered compromise—but rather a bold, nonbinary expression of individuality. Wearing 1725 feels like a subtle act of resistance against outdated norms. It’s a scent for everyone and no one, a wearable protest against the rigid labels some cling to like relics of a less enlightened time.

My last outing with this one was for a christening and it worked perfectly', ""The sob story: 1725 was originally marketed for men, however, some homme frags are easily unisex, so had to try. For me unisex perfumes seem to be the way to go in 2023/2024, as I cannot identify with the sugarbombs that are marketed towards women these days. They are getting worse and worse every year: more basic, and sweeter. Spices and woody nuances are mostly absent in women's perfumes. What is more, am yet to find a lasting and femme lavender vanilla. Well lavender is a mostly found in men's stuff. My experience with 1725: 1725 opens deliciously, a mix of spice and citruses, slight ambery glow (unisex here). In the mid-phase I had a bit of a struggle with perception of soap, wood lacquer and powder. I'd say it's quite masculine (liqorice, is that you?). The drydown is more unisex again, more blended but still a bit soapy. 6 hours later, it is a very nice vanilla lavender scent.

So I guess this is my first real in-depth exposure to the ""powdery dandy fougere"" category...and I must say, it\'s not too bad. It doesn\'t have a dated smell at all like what is normally associated with fougeres. But for those looking for that strong oakmoss, bitter green, spiciness, etc...you won\'t get that here.

The oakmoss skin scent at the end is very pleasant"", 'Sugar cookie lavender fougere  1725 is a very delightful fragrance yet one that is overly advertised as a barbershop fragrance. It is indeed a fougere along the lines of the powdery dandy fougeres like Chanel Boy or the progenitor of the genderfusion fougere which is Monchoir de Monsieur. As much as the anti-woke airheads below might dislike it, the concept of genderfluidity exists in perfumery since the early 1900s, Caron pour un Homme blends the dry masculine lavender with its delicate feminine vanilla musk base. Guerlain Monchoir de Monsieur blends the feminine Jicky into a more masculine fougere structure. 1725 opens up with a fresh slightly Marseille soap like lavender opening with heaps of nutty coumarin/tonka following it. About 15 minutes in and all the way through the day a powdered sugar cookie dry down sits on my wrist, slightly nutty from the coumarin but predominantly powdery and vanillic.  Anyone can wear it. On me it feels like wearing an intentionally undersized watch, it’s delicate nature highlighting the inherent masculinity of my skin. Similar to AdP Mandorla, for less vanilla and more cleanliness (and overall quality) Chanel Boy comes to mind. Anyone more daring might enjoy the abstract Nicolai New York Intense, which is however a rather large departure.', ""Spicy soapy opening with anise and licorice  Lavender and citrus hints peeking through  Drydown is compeltely woody with creamy sandalwood, amber notes tied together with sweet vanilla There are still remainders of licorice and anise but the lavender and citrus completely disappear It's a lovely scent that I ofter wear before I go to sleep"", 'Definitely androgynous....

There’s one weird note I detect that makes me feel sick. It’s that plastic make-up bag smell. There’s so many better fougeres out there.', ""I like this one al lot. The first note a got was the almond. It is a soft, powdery, clean and relaxing skin scent. It reminds me a little bit at l' eau d'hivers by Frederic Malle, but it is way more powdery. To me it leans more feminine."", 'I get some Chergui vibes from this one on my skin, but add in an old makeup case and some baby powder, and this is an immediate scrubber and a pass for me.', ""5,5-6/10 (*little bit more than ok*) Nothing special, if you want something lavender-vanilla just go and buy original le male, it's better than 1725, i don't remember how invasion barbare smells like, but I think it was a lot better, but much more expensive. This fragrance reminds me something, but I can't remember what. Tbh I really regret spending ~$2/2.5 on this sampler. Smells soft spicy, with some larander and vanilla, can't smell any almonds or almond milk. If you want something spicy, reather buy something like Bvlgari Man in Black. Oh i realised what this fragrance reminds me, something like dior homme intense but with spicy notes, or dry down of gentlemen reserve privee but with vanilla, anyway i don't really like it as well like that two fragrances. I don't wear it yet, so can't say anything about performance or does it brings compliments or not. Conclusion: Designer quality in niche, what means overpriced if we compare price and quality."", '1725 is a soft, powdery, and dandy fragrance. Even though it has a touch of sweetness, there is nothing cloying about it. This fragrance is best for transitional seasons during the day.', 'I wish I could make this last longer. What a gorgeous and sophisticated scent. Almost as soapy as I can stand (that place belongs to Xinu Monstera). I would wear in the spring any time, and on cool summer nights.', 'The word “powdery” is thrown around in the fragrance community a lot. Half the time the fragrance feels and smells NOTHING like any sort of powder.  This, by all means, is powdery. More than anything else I have ever come across.  It is a sweet powdery lavender and sandalwood. Not uber syrupy sweet but more “old school” sweet if that makes sense.  The licorice and anisic qualities are far in the background but still serve to give this a slight masculine edge. They are sort of like a good bass drum in music - they are felt more than they are heard. Almond is listed as a note, but it isn’t the artifical almond sweetener kind you find in Hypnotic Poison or PDM Pegasus. Rather, it is a very subtle impression of “nuttiness” to my nose. Again, felt and not heard. I do not get one single iota of citrus but it is still refreshing. It has a (just slightly manly) sweet baby powder vibe to me. Awesome for a day in spring. Overall, I like this. You can pull it off if you are confident and well dressed. Exudes a unique kind of clean. 8.0/10', ""This is undoubtedly one of the best perfumes I own, and I have hundreds. I bought it many years ago and have used it in any situation and during any season. Despite being very subtle and ethereal, it has a strong presence and a defined personality hidden behind an initial impression of a warm, clean, and safe fragrance. It's not a perfume that screams, but you feel it, and it faithfully accompanies you during both summer and winter. I recently finished the bottle, but I'm about to buy another one. I believe that 1725 easily ranks in my top 3 alongside Carnal Flower and Ambre Precieux. I don't know why many associate 1725 with the scent of baby wipes. I dare to hypothesize that it depends largely on the undeniable differences in taste among citizens of the continents of the world. As an Italian, I consider this perfume a masterpiece that speaks softly, a small pearl in a sea of unnecessary noise. Americans, don't hate me: it's like when I choose a restaurant on TripAdvisor and select the option for reviews in my language. Europeans, step forward."", '""Cookie Fougère"" of Licorice, Marzipan & Lavender... This is so good. It\'s quite sweet, and the almond-vanilla has a paste texture that evokes marzipan. I agree with reviewer alphairone below who describes it as ""An anisette cookie fougere, sprinkled lightly with powdered sugar and resting on a hassock of lavender...this barbershop is adjacent to an Italian bakery."" 1725 was composed as a tribute to Casanova, and I could imagine the late Heath Ledger wearing this while filming Casanova (film 2005). The discovery set insert reads: ""Giacomo Girolamo Casanova: a man whose name has come to symbolize seduction. For every Casanova, here is an eau de parfum inviting intense pleasure with amber fern, find woody accords and touches of sparkling Italian bergamot. ""  I get some reminders of Le Male Jean Paul Gaultier & Hypnotic Poison Dior. and for an oversimplified comparison this could be a masculine version of Hypnotic Poison, or in a family of sweet almond-anise scents including Loverdose Diesel, Lolita Lempicka Lolita Lempicka and Hypnotic Poison Dior. It makes sense, since Hypnotic Poison is considered a femme fatale scent, while Casanova is reputed for his notorious amorous adventures. It\'s a love for me. 10/10. Enjoy!', 'I smell lavender way more than licorice or star anise.', 'It smells like baby powder or baby wipes. Not that close to Invasion Barbare either. Feels too precious and soft. Disappointing.', 'On paper - smells like Chanel\'s Boy, minus the fizzy citruses on top. A very clear, crisp lavender, unisex-to-masc fougere. On skin - lavender and anise much more prominent on my skin, but in a very powdery, clean, barely soapy way. Nice! Very put-together and I actually like this a lot more than Chanel\'s Boy.  Scent: 7.5/10 - refreshing and clean, yet unique Perfectly unisex IMO, while there\'s that powdery aspect, I don\'t think it leans ""round"" or ""creamy"" enough to be considered feminine.', ""This is not a fougere, it's mostly lavendery powder and white smelling makeup, with glimpses of light pastel colors. A very nice and pleasant scent, gentle and velvety, projection is appropriate and longevity is great. It's similar to Prada Black and equally good.

Unisex, not leaning to any direction in particular.', 'Spiced lavender and vanilla. Clean scent, something like a laundry pod. Unisex but a little too musky or dense to lean femme, although it’s otherwise a feminine leaning scent if that makes sense. In other words, the balance is off-kilter. Somewhere between a 😐 and a 🙂. Personal preference suggests this is a pass. Not because it’s uninteresting, but because it’s not practically enjoyable.', 'The opening is fresh, soft and warm almond lavender talcum powder smell. Like a man that just left the barbershop & walked into the bakery next door & there’s fresh croissants nearby. Absolutely no citrus in the fragrance. I begin to pick up on a couple of unpleasant notes mixing, Amber, sandalwood & licorice.. which is just a tad scratchy (sandalwood always does this to me). The almond is noticeable & quite a nice twist. Overall it’s a pleasant wearing. Kinda like a mix of Darley, Prada Black & baby powder. Wish the almond/ vanilla was amped up just a touch. Edit: Sometimes on the dry down a few hours later, I get make-up bag vibes (might be the quality of lavender mix).. like a feminine beauty product, just hints at it. It hurts my head after about 1hr. It’s lacking a deeper note to hold it down as more masculine. begins to tilt to the unisex side ever so slightly. Because of this, I like to layer 1725 with actual fougére fragrances, making them powdery & fluffy.. Or w/ something cocoa 🤤.  1725 has made its way in my top 10 for life. good silage so I suggest 1-2 sprays max', ""Baby powder contoured with lavender and perhaps a hint of anise. Quite a sillage--it's tickling my nose from all the way down on my forearm. If you can get past the tickle, up close next to the skin there's a slight hint of something a little more sweetly earthy. It comes and goes and I wonder if I'm imagining it. The cedar perhaps? The amber? I want a bit more of that, I think. I imagine this perfume would mingle wonderfully with one's own 'odeur personelle'. After all, this is by conception an 18th century scent. Perhaps try applying it after a particularly vigorous romp and see where that gets you."", 'After a couple wearings I can say that this opens up similar to Invasion Barbare and dries down similar to the old Dior Homme. But instead of getting the soft creaminess from Iris, it gets it from vanilla and sandalwood. Either way this is absolutely a Casanova fragrance! For a gentle, put together, confident man or woman.', 'Mrrob sums it upp very well, its my go to sleep scent. Every note is so very nicely done, the blend is superb, and it gives a old school yet modern touch, its like a creamy dreamy powdery wonder. I would not even say its that much off a fougere, its in a Leauge off its own. You can ware it in a suit...in the bath..naked...every place is a place to wear this wonderful gem Talking points are the almond and the lavender in this beauty, anis and licorice note is mostly prominent in the opening were it combines w the grape and makes a sour explosion for about a second, then it calmes down and acts smoooth and friendly  Now its time to sleep...two sprays and my pillow will carry my on soft clouds to the dream land..', '1725 Casanova is often considered a Neo fougere I agree that the powder / lavender aspect does give a nod to fougere frags but I feel this is more of an oriental style fragrance as the licorice vanilla and almond become the focus in the dry down. Although vanilla and almond are here I would not say this is a gourmand This definitely gives off a groomed feel but also smells cozy and relaxing and actually makes for a good bed scent. I personally love wearing this one in neutral to cooler months in the morning it can be worn to work out to breakfast even to church as this does have a slight dandy feel to it. Wears well with gray / blue khakis and a crisp white shirt or even a warm sweater in the fall. Ultimately it gives the feeling of joy and of good moments in life.', ""Testing blind this opened with a slightly spicy air with a musky and barely powdery body. There's a hint of animalistic character but as it dries down it loses this and a good portion of it's spicy character, but not completely and lingers around for a good long while as predominantly a soft but intimate powdery fragrance. To me there's a hint of sweetness but it's not really sweet per se. Definitely gives a nod towards its name. Interesting, but not my dig."", ""I've tried this and now own it. Very much like MDCI Invasion Barbare. Very alluring, warm, spicy, heavy anise which I like and licorice nuanced. If you have one, you don't need the other. It's redundant. Longevity is very respectable and sillage equally so. Since the quality is so high, you'll pay!  A very well made fragrance, excellent quality workmanship."", ""I recently picked up a botlle of 1725 Casanova and I'm sorry that I didn't discover it sooner. I love this stuff...it is a licorice and lavender powder puff. I also get the almond and vanilla, but the sweetness here is very light, just a hint. This doesn't veer into cloying-land. I do find this playful and seductive, but at the same time it is grown-up and swank. I can't really think of a time or place that this wouldn't be appropriate. Wearing this makes me feel dapper and dashing...it puts a little pep in my step. Good stuff."", 'I just got it and here are my thoughts. OPENING: Smells completely different than i thought it would, but not in a bad way, but I definitely don´t get any citruses from the opening at all, except a sweet orange note that kind of reminds me of sunscreen, which i am a fan of, but i would honestly prefer something more fresh, like for example the bergamot note in Armani Code. I also smell lavenders and licorice a lot. DRYDOWN: Dry down is beautiful. The vanilla note comes in play and makes everything smoother. It kind of reminds me of baby wipes. I saw some people compare this to Le Male, Armani Code and Invasion Barbare. I don´t know how IB smells but this does not smell like Le Male or Armani Code. Maybe like 15% resemblance to LM and 10% resemblance to Code. Both code and le male are way more fresh and masculine, this on the other hand is creamy and unisex and just something completely different. PERFORMANCE is not bad, but i would appreciate slightly better performance sillage wise, because even though with perfumes like this (sweet and seductive) you probably don´t want to have 10 feet room filling sillage, it still could be slightly better. FINAL THOUGHTS: I really like this one, but i don´t think i am going to buy another bottle just because it´s just not fresh enough for me. I would also definitely call this unisex. I can easily imagine a woman wearing this, even though it might be slightly more masculine leaning. It could easily be used as a signature scent. Edit: After wearing it multiple times i learned to like it even more than before. I would give it like 6 before, but now, after a month, i rate it 8', ""Goes on totally warm powder with odd woody notes, not really masculine at all, but not sweet enough to be feminine. But sooooo not something I like on a man. Just too much lavender powder. As it dries, though, I am loving it a lot. Soft, clean powder more like a lotion than babies. Full dry down has a tang among the soft woody vanilla lavender. Very nice after all. But still not masculine. It’s only unisex for older men. Reminds me a bit of my a cologne my grandfather wore, which I don't love."", ""I do not really know what to say about this fragrance, I really don’t. I hate liquorice, I hate Star Anise, but the reviews all gave me an indicator that this was very well blended, and ll the notes seemed so haphazard that they all must play a symphony I've never been acquainted with before. Oh well, I decided to buy it, and test it, and my oh my. First and fore mostly, I can not believe how unique this is, I have never, ever smelled anything quite like this, nor does it conjure up images of it being alike anything else I have smelled. I also Ama again doubly shocked that this was released 22 years ago. I am about to be blasphemous and say, Fredric Malle, Carnal Flower, POAL, Must Ravaguer have all been trumped by this. This sits in the classic, unique and so, oh so delightful pedestal all on its own. I am horrendous at describing or painting pictures of how the different notes and accords dance with one another, and so many others have already described in exquisite and artistic detail. I am merely here to say, this is simply gorgeous, to another level. it is extremely classy, very elegant, I thought initially that it would be worn on occasions, but I have a confession, I have not stopped wearing it, since I bought it. This is must, this is sublime."", ""Extremely attractive perfume.. The lavender and vanilla combo is done to perfection. Very alluring scent that is smooth and blended with mastery. Can't imagine this work of art is launched 22 years ago as it smells so contemporary. 10/10 for me and blind buy worthy."", 'High quality, soft & relaxing . Modern-caron pour homme. Very nice!', 'The note chart perfectly sums up the scent. I like this scent, but I find it hard to picture myself or anybody being attracted to a man who wears it. In my fantasy, this is how Tom Hulce\'s Mozart smells like - artsy, cute, and charming, but not something that makes you go ""Hubba Hubba"", which was I was expecting with a scent inspired by Casanova...', ""Caron's Pour Un Homme's dashing young grandson. Three interlocking scents support this lovely perfume: an initial whiff of anise and citrus, an emerging lavender note and a lingering sandalwood/amber dry down.  The structure is solid without being heavy, intricate and intriguing, like a baroque fountain, sending forth fantastical plumes of rich perfume for the delectation of all who pass by. Lovely!"", 'One year ago when i achieved it i was unimpressed and confused. It was too sweet imo. I bought it mainly for the licorice note and had other expectations i guess. However! This is actually the one that i reach for the most as of now and it is certainly very pleasant. Changed from like to love :) This is unisex to me, 100%. I dont get the masculine vibe as from beau de jour for example. However, I did initially percieve it to be feminine until I got used to it. Beautiful blend, and it project just perfectly.

Despite the year on the bottle, it does not remind you of olden times. Rather rebirth and spring soap.', ""Quality ingredients in a surprisingly subtle formula from HdP. I sometimes crave this fragrance, but I consider it a sort of stay-at-home scent. The projection is quite limited, I think by design in keeping with the Casanova theme: you need to smell this right on the skin to get the full effect. It leans feminine to my nose, and quite young in a sort of marshmallow-y way (that I think comes from the almond and vanilla notes being quite prominent, a mouthwatering confectioners sugar effect right behind in strength and longevity). The licorice is there, sure, but like the citrus components it's quite fugitive unless you're pressing your nose to the skin. This is a wonderful companion to reading under a blanket on a dreary day. It's also nice to open up a jacket in the closet and be greeted by the impression of 1725 from the last time you wore it. Cosy, intimate, homey."", 'A seriously upscale aromatic fougere.

A lovely Flower-y and powdery mix of lavender and vanilla. The star anise and mix of liquorice is gives it, it’s masculine scent. It fades to a mild soft scent.  I’d describe the sex more as unisex. Not very long lasting about 3 hours on the skin. For imagery I imagine soft snow falls, streets lamps illuminating snow flakes so they look as if they’re glowing, dark shadows and streets in winter nights, starring at the cold snow from inside and room filled with cozy wooden furniture as I stare at something in the snow that I’m not sure if it’s really there or not.', ""Pretty unique smell, have't experience anything like this before."", ""I get licorice, almonds, lavender and vanilla. I'm loving this perfume. I bought it for it's similarity to By by Dolce and Gabanna and have fallen in love ith it for it's own merits. I'm a Guerlain-o-phile.

I just pulled the trigger on a big bottle of this to enjoy for years to come. Can't say enough good things about this perfume."", ""Hooray! I think this is a solid men's pick. Approachable and cuddly. Not too sweet, not too soapy. To me, it sits somewhere between Prada Amber Homme and Lutens Gris Clair...

Just don't overdo it!"", 'Pleasant wear. It feels like an Iris style means fragrance, but different. It’s clean, fresh and slightly aromatic. I like the licorice note and I find that it hands around and gives the fragrance a nice twist. It’s quite intimate, but lasts all day on me. If I had a full bottle I’d reach for it quite often.', 'First Impressions (sample spray): As a woman I wanted this perfume to be like Telegrama by imaginary authors, but more stronger. However, this perfume smells like lavender shaving cream, and definitely leans more masculine for my taste. I do appreciate it, and like it. Would I wear it probably not. This is definitely not like Telegrama at all.

It is noble, refined, but it's so easy to wear as it nods both to the classic fougere structure and modern sensibilities. Though it was released over twenty years ago, this could very well be released today and folks wouldn't give it a second thought. The barbershop powder is blended with almonds, which are more pronounced after the first half hour or so. It feels like this barbershop is adjacent to an Italian bakery.

Don't get me wrong, it is a nice almond cake and vanillic lavender barbershop smell - but it's not nearly as unique as some of HDP's other offerings. Not to mention there are Fougere scents at half the price that perform as well as this, and I'm not super keen on this one's more androgynous take on what is generally a more masculine genre of fragrance. Bottom line, its solid, but too safe of a take. 7.5/10"", 'Goes on with a flash of pepperiness, but within seconds sets out its stall. Opaque lavander, soft vanilla and a creeping-in of anise later on. Clean with a subtle gourmand-ish edge, this is unlikely to offend anyone, yet is missing a certain something to make it anything more than just ""very... nice"".  Have to say projection is intimate, longevity is mainly a skin scent for six-ish hours. A little disappointing. Lolita Lempicka Au Masculin is a very good alternative. Not so much a Casanova seducing the ladies than your best mate who always finds himself in the friend zone with the girls.', 'Absolute go-to for fresh, dandyish vibes. Leans formal but can easily be worn in a t-shirt and jeans as long as nothing is sloppy/ill-fitting.

Going moderate seems to be confusing. Again, that’s just me.  Seasons: I wouldn’t wear this in high heat, but it’s versatile enough to work in any season under 75 degrees.  Perfect for:  1.

Rating - 9/10"", ""I was really worried this would be ruined by the anise and licorice which I'm very sensitive. I really hate black licorice. Thankfully, it's dosed so low and blended so well I can't even smell it. As for the fragrance, it's a lover boy scent named after Casanova, the famous playboy.  The name is fitting as I could see this worn by a smooth operator that's charming and worldly. This is elegant French perfumery that is suprisingly unisex for a mens cologne. Super classy and soft lavender. I don't get any citrus.  My problem is that on me, the base reaction with my skin turns into feminine smelling baby powder mixed with sweat 💦 It's got a tiny bit of Invasion Barbare Barbare DNA which is, in my opinion, possibly the best barbershop fougere ever made.

You can wear it at any time and any season. 10/10.', 'Below reviewer DEDMAR is spot on describing the scent but here is my take: Feel: It is a romantic scent. It is a fougere without the notes that annoy women instead adding notes that adored by women. It is magnetic, but not screamer. It represents the boy for whom all the girls fall for and other men cannot find the reason behind it. Smell: not bakery, not too gourmandy but aromatic vanilla and almond mix with lavender candle type smell. Somehow manage to get a barbershop tone but not exactly a barbershop fougere like drakkar, at the barbers, rive gauche, egoeist etc.  Yes similar to mdci invasion barbare but fresher, more younger, way more stylish, chick magnet cousin.  Fragrantica stats are spot on in terms on projection and longevity', 'A powdery licorice fougere. It won’t fill that role for everyday summer scent, or if you’re looking for something fresh like typical men’s fougeres usually are, but it’s an interesting take on it. Personally I don’t love licorice and anise, but I figured maybe I just need to smell it amongst a good composition of other notes. That didn’t work out.

No way :D If MDCI Invasion Barbare would be represented by hyper masculine 2 meters tall commander in his bloody armor with ""I will cut your head off"" look and attitude, 1725 Histoires de Parfums then would be skiny bard holding a shiny golden harp and singing romantic songs looking to seduce somebody. The name Casanova is very accurate. But do not look for a IB alternative, though, you won\'t get it.  Perfectly unisex lavender bomb with powdery character.

The licorice/star anise accord brings a nice amount of natural sweetness(never cloying) to this composition, bringing a consistency to its balance with the lavender while changing slightly as it dries down and setting it apart. That also prevents it from leaning too masculine and I feel like this falls very much in the middle. Sillage is modest, longevity respectable. I have a couple others that cover this category and are more to my liking, but it's a respectable entry and recommended aromatic fougere particularly for those who prefer licorice/anise notes or would like something a little sweeter or softer."", 'Stunning, beautiful in summer.

Then the licorice/anise starts to come in and this reminds me of a more unisex, less sweet version of Lolita Lempicka for women (I haven't tried LL Au Masculin). For anyone who found LL to be too sweet or cloying this is a great one to try! I think this is one that would smell fantastic on a man or a woman. I do wish the projection on me was a bit better, though. I like barbershop and aromatic fougeres quite a bit, but I don't get that at all with this one."", '1725 ""scent profile"" is closer to Armani Code or Lolita au Masculin than to Invasion Barbare.  Armani Code is a bit more ""sour"" with that leather accord and has that ""designer average quality"" but, all in all, they are closely ""related"". Casanova, on the other hand, doesn’t stand on leather, but on licorice, what brings it closer to LL. But the aromatic vanilic base is the common ground to all of the aforementioned.  7/10', ""Smells pretty much like baby powder and not much else. Maybe some fancy baby powder. It lasts quite a while. It is very cozy and pleasant. I like it, but I think it's a bit overpriced for what it is. If I had money to burn... I prefer Invasion Barbare simply because there is more there. But the dry down is very similar.  Pasha, i order a small sample of this, along with some other niche fragrances from Luckyscent for pretty cheap."", 'I like this as a summer variation of Lempicka Au Masculin more than I did LL Au Masculin L\'eau, as it dials down some of the mild ""green-ness"" of AM and replaces it with the blend of citrus notes. It\'s just a touch less sweet (though not by much) and I feel that these changes, combined with that fougere-ishness that many pick up on fill that spot as a summer-friendly take on a powdery-anise-licorice scent (which I like to use some variation of throughout the year) quite nicely.', 'Just a like from me.

It comes off as a nice easy going barbershop scent laid on a base of vanilla and almonds with a powdery vibe, similar to the powder aroma applied at the barbers after a shave.

A personal enjoyment due to its soft, sweet, fresh nature, however I have not received any compliments. IMO: 6/10', 'I don’t understand why this has such a high rating. First, it smells like crap. Not even worth $10 IMO. Second, it doesn’t perform. It’s a skin scent upon application. Third, there are tons of better barbershop fragrances out there. Try this before purchasing. It’s seriously overrated', ""I sampled this a few years ago and was so taken by its originality that I've purchased several 15 ml bottles and I'm now onto my first full bottle. I don't consider this a fougere; the brightness of the opening is not 'barber-shop' style, it's zingy, fresh and lighthearted, yes, but more of a gentle 'wake-up', not a sharp slap in the face. Charming, not abrupt. The dry down is what makes it so unique; it's soft, welcoming, sensual. Totally unisex. Some men who're looking for the old-school fougere will be disappointed but those who want something entirely unique will be delighted. I'm a woman and love to wear it in warm weather. Give it a try! It's a true delight."", ""Beautiful contemporary fougere that dabbles in spicy, barbershop, and gourmand territories. It definitely evokes Invasion Barbare, especially the drydown that feels like a sweet, crisp marriage of lavender, spice, and coumarin. I also find a similar final drydown in Lutens' Fourreau Noir. I can see how people get a bit of Lolita Lempicka Au Masculin from the notable licorice/anise note that manages to be well-balanced. Delectable, easy to wear, and much more budget friendly than IB without feeling like a step down in quality. Great scent!"", ""I wouldn't call this a babershop because it's way too gourmandy and smells kind of like a powdery almond flavoured cake ,imagine a feminine version of Armani code. It gave me a bit of a headache not fresh and another thing is that the bottle is pretty tacky and low quality."", ""Surprising, that's an apt definition - if totally useless.

Yet, it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. A fascinating surprise!"", 'If you were to have a Venn diagram with a lavender barbershop-esque fragrance and a gourmand, this would sit almost in the center.

This is like... a man embracing his feminine aspects and it makes him so sexy and masculine in the process of doing so. A push and pull dynamic like the vanilla does here with the lavender."", ""High class pour un Homme... Having read about this several times, my interest was piqued when I found a 15 ml bottle on sale recently. Opening with a fleeting citrus this scent goes very quickly into the heart of dusty lavender and dries down on vanilla, amber and just a hint of leather or maybe liquorice. I don't really get any of the mentioned woods or almonds.  Now, I am usually very fine with lavender, as in the fresh spicy Platinum Egoiste or the oriental La Nuit de l'Homme. None the less something in 1725 just doesn't sit right with me. When I spray it on my skin, it comes off... feminine maybe? Don't get me wrong, I'm all about people wearing what they like instead of being directed by the gender instructions from the manufacturer, but this one makes me feel slightly uncomfortable about myself when wearing it out and about. I have a feeling that the mix of lavender with amber and vanilla is what makes this happen. To be honest, this strikes me much more as a unisex than a male perfume. It's a fougere all right, but don't expect it to be your typical male fougere as it lacks the freshness that most feature. The scent that reminds me the most of this one is Caron's Pour un Homme (or even the powderiness of a less leathery version of Midnight in Paris), even if 1725 seems to be richer and generally of a higher quality. Both projection and longevity are rather moderate as 1725 is pretty subtle, not a loud scent in any way. I haven't read into it but if this scent is supposed to represent Casanova, I'd see him as more of a dandy, tease or a charmer rather than a seducer.  Long story short, after testing it several times over a couple of weeks I caved in and gifted it to my girlfriend - on whom it smells delightful, go figure. Overall, it's clean and sophisticated but I advise to try before you buy."", 'I love their 1899 and thought this could be a lower cost alternative to MDCI. Sorry! This is a powdery sweet scent. Definitely leans feminine and not really close to Invasion Barbare IMO.', ""This is not a fougère, at least in the classic term. No green or herbal notes, no traditional spicy fougère notes. A lot of sweetness and powder. Fougère? Give me a break, this is closer to a cookie than a fougère. If you compared it to Le Male, but again, calling Le Male fougère is stretching it as well. Except for Lavender, i don't see many notes that would make this a fougère. And the lavender is not as prominent as some suggest, it goes under the sweet and powdery notes. This is very sweet and powdery, and if didn't know there was lavender in the heart notes, i would have trouble guessing it. And to the comparison with Invasion Barbare, really? There is some slight resemblance that they both have some sweetness and powder (Invasion Barbare far far less, and that also because of the Violet and not licorice and Almond). Invasion Barbare is a fougère with a modern twist, not too sweet and has some green herbal and spicy notes to it. This one however could as well be a unisex or feminine fragrance with the super thick layer of Vanilla, Anise and Almond. No green, herbal or soapy qualities whatsoever. This is a semi gourmand, which is fine, but to me it possesses no fougère qualities."", 'A very smooth and subtle fragrance.  Undoubtedly a fougere in the ""classic style"". No screeching, or shouting here. On my skin this is predominantly powder, vanilla, lavender.  Oddly enough, the mid and drydown reminds me of a ""Creamy Johnson\'s Baby Shampoo"". Not bad, but not necessarily what I want to smell like.  Completely unisex in my opinion. In fact, I think this would be a head turner on a lady. On men,(at least this man)it smells quite ""vintage"". All in all?

I enjoy 1725 more than IB.', ""It is funny that Histoires de Parfums decided to market this composition as a representation of Casanova, the legendary Italian author famous for his affairs, since I can't connect the 2 ideas of seduction and sweet fougeres together. Anyhow, 1725 is a powdery, dusty fragrance, with a clean, citrus-like licorice accord in the opening, blended among a vanilla-almond base note combination to provide sweet qualities to the mixture, which it is then dialed back by an anise note in the heart. In the mid notes, the anise is mixed with a lavender smell, in which they create an adult, mature, and casual aura to the fragrance. 1725 does contain some sour liquor-like undertones to the composition before the powdery sections, and I get about 7 hours on my skin with moderate projection. Histoires de Parfums has a reputation of creating quality scents, but at the same time, the end result of their base line products have a lackluster depth to them. In this case, 1725 often feels uninteresting, dull, and bland due to the lack of a star accord to make it worthwhile. Nonetheless, 1725 does come off as a smooth, powdery, old-school, and pleasant scent, especially for the days after getting a haircut and running around doing chores.

The blend of lavender/vanilla/almond/anice nearly emulates cinnamon. It\'s a warm frag for Fall days.  That said, while it\'s definitely aromatic, I don\'t see it at all as a fougere... lavender alone is not enough to tell it\'s a fougere. There\'s no freshness in this one, at the opposite, vanilla gives some sweetness. For a moment, I thought I had sprayed 1899... But at this pricepoint, ""nice"" is not enough, and there are no excuses for bad projection. They have to realize at some point that they are competing with houses like Amouage, Tiziana Terenzi and Le Labo, Etat Libre d\'Orange in that price range, that, except for a few exceptions, are playing in a higher league (in terms of scent originality). What saves HdP is their ""alternative"" bottle size offerings, and thus effective pricing (0.5, 2 and 4oz, instead of the more common 1.7 and 3.4oz). All of HdP fragrances are pleasant, but lack audacity (except for ""1740"" and ""Noir Patchouli"" in which there is maybe a little too much).

Casanova is not synthetic as such, but when compared to IB - it is of a much lower quality and does come across as somewhat harsh in the opening.  As for comparisons, Casanova does smell like Invasion Barbare - but really only after 90 minutes or so - when (for me) Invasion Barbare becomes uninteresting. I think many who compare haven't done so side by side. The openings are vastly different - IB evolves a great deal whilst 1725 Casanova doesn't change much from its initially spray Casanova openining is completely different to IB - it is very powdery, it lacks the very prominent cardamom of IB and has a different and harsher citrus note whilst the violet leaf also make the openings of the two fragrances to be quite different. The lavender in Casanova also isn't quite as prominent as it is IB. Casanova does have almond, which in later stages may evoke the base vanilla of Invasion Barbare adding to the similarity we smell later on. So broadly speaking - it's really in the late mid notes to base where the two converge. Invasion Barbare is always a step ahead of though. And if money was no issue - I'd buy IB. IB's first 90 mins are lovely. 1725 Casanova is like a slightly sweet mix of baby powder and shaving foam. But if you like it buy it. But I wouldn't.

The opening is a bit confused but after a few minutes when that almond and sandalwood...and with some of the citrus there...appear, and guid the remaining the evolution here. If i had a complaint it is that following that the vanilla becomes a bit too pronounced. Now, that said, the longevity isnt great. Its ok, but not great. And at these prices it should be better.

So, what does this mean for the scent? To be honest this is a powdery scent with hints of citrus, almond, and licorice with a bit of lavender and star anise. The opening of this scent is not my favorite, Its is a really powdery opening, think Casanova's powdered wig. The opening, after holding on for olfactory patience, gives way to a fantastic mid. The amber and sandalwood give this scent some muscle, and then we get the licorice and lavender with some hints of almond, lingering citrus, star anise and vanilla. HdP 1725 then shifts from powdery to slightly creamy and a bit gourmandish, which in my opinion saves this scent and renders it really enjoyable and wearable. I think I read into the hype a bit too much with this one. A lot of people say it has a barbershop vibe, which I think is due in part to people reading lavender in the notes. Its is not a barbershop scent per se, but I feel 1725 is a gentleman's scent. Now, this scent is tricky to find an occasion to wear it. Yes, I can get all cliche and say; wear 1725 with a nice suit and tie. But no. I think 1725 is what you wear when like Casanova often did; plot.

Perhaps... 1725 is certainly an attractive barbershop-style fragrance that is hard to dislike. The typical descriptions enter the nose/brain upon first sniff - 'clean', 'fresh', etc. Lavender is present from the off, and also throughout. Vanilla is what helps make 1725 a potential scent for both sexes. A hint of almond and warming amber. In fact, the combination of lavender and vanilla makes me think of JPG Le Male - only a more mature version. Fairly linear scent throughout. Ideal for work, casual days, etc. If you are looking for a projection beast in 1725, then it is not for you. 1725 sits very close to the skin from the off, surrounding you in your own little sweet-lavender-bubble. Longevity, however, is slightly greater - six hours and it should still be noticeable. So, as I mentioned, what is not to like about smelling clean and fresh? Performance, if that is your thing. If not, and the odd delightful whiff of yourself every now and again throughout the day is what you want, 1725 should be a welcome fragrance in any collection."", 'This ""Casanova"" is a smooth operator in a powdery velvet coat of purple lavender.

Here is my take. Casanova 1725 - It almost has the same lavender barber shop scent that Invasion offers but without the harsh blast of lavender that invasion has. This scent is mellow and soft. I get a creamy almond vanilla scent from this. It almost has a powdery smell to it but not in a feminine way. Casanova is an excellent name for this fragrance. You're left wanting more from this scent which is what Casanova was all about. Its like you're drawn to it but if you get to close and figure it out you'll be left dissatisfied. Best advise I can give the wearer of this scent is don't wear it for you, but wear it for the people around you. This becomes a close skin scent after about 4 hours and if you haven't been able to get the girl close enough to you within those 4 hours of 1st application you'll lose her. Casanova was patient but didn't spend too much in one place remember that when wearing this.  *Longevity - Good not great 6-8  *Projection - Good but soft *Year round scent easily worn in the warmer months unlike Invasion Barbare Invasion Barbare - At first sniff I thought it was a little too harsh of a scent. I get a serious blast of lavender. If I was to describe how heavy it starts off - think of Sandalwood by Art of Shaving and mixing in lavender. Its softens with a bit of vanilla but the heavy lavender lingers. Ideally when you walk by a person the draft you will create should make the person smelling you, think...sweet but masculine and distinguished (just left the barbershop) Its like clashing heavy and soft together. Invasion is a great name for this scent because people will feel invaded by you when walking by but very happy that you did. I think this fragrance smells better to the people smelling you than it does to the person wearing it. The lavender blast is a bit too much. Maybe with the right atomizer it will air it out and soften it more. *Longevity - Great!! All day  *Projection - excellent, it will concur and invade *Fall/Winter wearer this at in the colder months, too heavy for the summer"", 'For once I agree with reviewers detection of notes here on Fragrantica. This is anis/licorice on lavender/vanilla. Very charming and very nice. I find it changes a little dependent on weather and what soap I used in the shower. Sometimes I find the anis/licorice a little too sharp. But when the balance is tilted the other way, I love this fragrance. Pretty linear, the lavender/vanilla is blended, not serial as in Caron puh or Taste of heaven. Unisex they say, but come on. Casanova was amongst the greatest seducers of the charming kind. (Not the masculine rake Don Juan type).  So great fragrance for the charming man who says no to loud powerhouses, wimpy aquatics and big leather chypres. 9/10', 'This one have character its like a dusty sweet lemon powder nice and safe', 'this one smells like a luxirious baby diaper.. does it smell good ? it actually does :)', ""Potent licorice-and-lavender-over-amber up top and into the heart. Lavender carries on over the base, which is surprisingly sweet, and includes scents of cocoa, iris, patchouli, and stone. None of this is groundbreaking, but it is beautiful, wearable, and a kind of a Goldilocks 'just right.'"", 'My thoughts on my single wearing of 1725: It\'s surrounded by an aura of beauty and charm. It\'s a very ""pretty"" fragrance. It\'s just not something I care to smell like. I would say it\'s powdery, vanilla and lavender battling to dominate with citrus and licorice trying to make it to the front of the line, but both relegated to minor roles. I\'ve not sampled Invasion Barbare, but I do find some similar familial traits with Le Male and Caron Pour un Homme, and even a little Third Man. I will say that the notes seem very well blended and it strikes me as very gentlemanly. But like I said, I prefer the more exotic, darker fragrances. Slightly better than average projection. Good longevity. My rating 7.0', ""It's a rich smelling citrus and powder blend that dries down to what smells like an expensive talcum powder. This is the most powdery fragrance for men that I've ever smelled. The citrus is light at best and I don't pick up the lavender.

Rather delicate and effate, with a slight touch of baby powderiness from the lavender.

The powdery sweetness almost takes this in a Dior Homme direction, while maintaining a serious tip of the cap to classic masculine fougeres of the past. If you thought Dior Homme was too feminine, or thought Invasion Barbare was too classic, or, you're just looking for the best of both worlds - I think this is something you'll really enjoy. As far as quality of ingredients go, yes, Invasion Barbare is absolutely best in class. However, I get greater joy wearing 1725. It suits me better as a man in his late 20's. It's got just enough old-school to make me think of my father, but more than enough new-school to NEVER make my wife or other girls think of old men.  This is a classic for a new generation."", 'Hi.

Thank you very much for help me with this questions!', 'Yep, very similar to Invasion Barbare. I find the anise most prominent followed by the vanilla. Lavender lags behind those two a good bit. Very nice but something about it puts it a notch behind IB. Maybe its the ingredient quality like others have said.', ""The sweetness catches your attention immediately the first time you try it and it stays true throughout the longevity of the scent. The citrus linger for only a few minutes at best. The lavender, anise, sandlewood, of course vanilla and amber notes give it that barber shop quality. Try it a second time you will probably like it more because the overwhelming sweetness will be expected. If you like powdery/dry fragrances as I do, you will enjoy this scent most likely. Masculine and appropriate for any occassion or situation. I would consider it a fall and winter scent because of it sweetness. Honestly I can't see anyone disliking this fragrance but it can be cloying if you wear too much ..A little goes a long way and there is no need to reapply during the day.

Excellent longevity."", ""Definitely not Invasion Barbare based on a first wearing from a sample bottle direct from PdH. Similar middle character but is much toned down, whereas the top is harsher. Dries down quickly, as noted by a previous review. A very pleasant fougere. Powdery, but well-blended. I wish I had never tried Invasion Barbare, because if I didn't know there was an even better fougere out there, I would have no problem paying the full $125 for a 60mL bottle of 1725.

One of those great scents that are so very RIGHT in so many ways that you could wear forever. I definitely prefer IB, which is peerless, but who cares?  I paid $51 for 120ml of 1725 while IB is $250 for 60ml. Maybe I've let that cloud my judgement.

A little bit too safe imo. The blend of lavender/vanilla/almond/anice nearly emulates cinnamon. It\'s a warm frag for Fall days.  That said, while it\'s definitely aromatic, I don\'t see it at all as a fougere... lavender alone is not enough to tell it\'s a fougere. There\'s no freshness in this one, at the opposite, vanilla gives some sweetness. For a moment, I thought I had sprayed 1899... But at this pricepoint, ""nice"" is not enough, and there are no excuses for bad projection. They have to realize at some point that they are competing with houses like Amouage, Tiziana Terenzi and Le Labo, Etat Libre d\'Orange in that price range, that, except for a few exceptions, are playing in a higher league (in terms of scent originality). What saves HdP is their ""alternative"" bottle size offerings, and thus effective pricing (0.5, 2 and 4oz, instead of the more common 1.7 and 3.4oz). All of HdP fragrances are pleasant, but lack audacity (except for ""1740"" and ""Noir Patchouli"" in which there is maybe a little too much). I\'m not a marketing expert, but unless they decide to target exclusively 50+ crowds, they are on the wrong path. That said, the 0.5oz offering around $35 make me think they don\'t want that...

I had my own expectations in general and in particular after sampling the enthralling Marquis de Sade, which is very hard to take (I even got angry at the perfumer one night I found it, simply put, faecal) BUT you can say there is a link between the name and the scent... some sort of search in that one. Here, the opposite. A nice scent that smells like many other and one that never ever I\'d relate to any interesting guy such as Casanova or any other. I won\'t be harsh since the name of perfumes hardly mean anything to me anyways... but in this case the brand caught my attention for its quality and its sort of ""game"" of evocation and unique mixes... well... here I don\'t see that. Or, to be honest, it is not what I imagined it to smell like... this is too Marie-Antoinette... powdery, girly in a commonplace way, nothing short of talcum, clean in just-showered-babies kind ... and perhaps it does evoke palaces and secretive women of that time... but I expected this to be sexy as hell, not bitchy. Masculine, not obviously old grand ma. I mean, no problem with those perfumes... I like them! What I intend to say is: there are many more interesting ways to make a men\'s scent androgynous if that\'s the intention. Many more original and less ""safe"" ways to face these challenges, something I expect from niche and particularly from this brand. Now back to the scent... it smells nice!

Even for discounter prices this is still very overpriced for what it is.

While it is complex and of high quality, I cannot see myself picking it over other designer or niche fragrances. That's not to say it smells bad in anyway, it's pleasent and clean, but a bit out-dated and won't stand out or be interesting enough to impress most people. Now add to consideration the price, and I struggle to see a rational justification for buying it.

A bit too floral for me (although that's only a personal preference), but also lacks the character of the others, and projection and longevity are average."", 'I ended up blind buying this fragrance and to be honest I didn’t know what to expect but I knew i would either love it or hate it based off of the polarized reviews I read across various review sites and YouTube. There were people claiming it smells grandmotherly and feminine, while others claiming it smelt luxurious and rich.  My bottle arrived yesterday and as always the presentation with Clive Christian is nothing but class, rich elitism. And I’m all for it. The bottle is beautiful and the atomizer and weight is everything you want.  Upon first spray I was immediately captivated. It’s blended to perfection and incredibly smooth. It opens with a pop of nutmeg, wood, spice, all which is held together by the powdery quality which stays throughout its lifespan. As it opens up in to the mid notes the florals enter the scene and it vacillates between yellow and white floral aromatics, with nutmeg and a cinnamon quality slightly present in the background which makes it alluring and devine. You can detect sandalwood as-well but it’s not in-your-face woods. But rather It’s creamy, and super smooth — I guess 50 year old sandalwood really does make a difference!  It is powdery and the florals are present, but what many hate-reviewers leave out of their review is the part about the background spice which makes this fragrance so engaging. It’s not just powder powder powder.. it’s in this order to my nose: Powdery spices, smooth wood, slight spices, floral, spices. All together at once. So if a person is expecting low amounts of powder or florals and just some wood, yea you won’t get that.  This concoction is incredibly classy. Black tie event. Important get together. Wedding fragrance. Anniversary dinner. It’s simply just pure class, as the bottle suggests. It was an instant love for me and I know I’ll just grow to love it more because of its complexity.  Where the grandmother is concerned.. I think people just associate floral with female. And class with old person, in this overly sugar sweet or blue fragrance designer saturated market.  Before buying, while I was reading reviews I was concerned about it being too fem or granny. But be rest assured it is not. It’s powdery and smooth, just very refined. You’ll see.. This is a fragrance for men. Not guys or boys. Men.  The performance is amazing. Solid sillage and longevity is 24+ hours. So no concerns there.  This just edged out my Royal Oud for the number 1 spot of what to wear at black tie events… And for a darker take on it, I imagine spritzing ‘X For Men’ by CC overtop would make this classy beast a bit brooding. I will give that a shot when my bottle arrives! (Generally I’m not a fan of layering since I think it muddles fragrances too much but I will report back) 10/10 — pure class act', 'Absolute love at first sniff.  Damn it, why do I always really like the expensive ones?  No. 1 has a combination of some of my favorite notes in perfumery resulting in a unique, powdery, creamy, woody, floral, clean soapy musk. It is a wonderful example of a powdery accord done well, a slight nod to perfumes from the past, buttery iris, heliotrope for an almost almondy/nutty effect, and creamy, soapy sandalwood. Can’t stop sniffing myself. Just like Roja Dove’s Roja Haute Luxe, this literally made my eyes physically roll into the back of my head the moment I first sprayed it onto my skin. Hedonistic, kaleidoscopic. Much more complex than it appears upon first encounter, incredibly well blended.  I opened a door to go outside about an hour after that first spray and the air rushing out and around me brought the fragrance up to my nose in whiffs of pure anosmic ecstasy, slightly different than what i experience when i put my nose straight up to my skin, so I know this must smell lovely to others in the air. And if not, that’s okay, because I absolutely am infatuated with this stuff, and I wouldn’t care if it makes others happy or not, because it makes me happy.  50ml for $700 is quite expensive, but you can grab 10ml in the $300 traveler set, which comes out to $100 for 10ml. That’s a little better value per ml if you want a small bottle, which is funny because usually with most houses and designers you usually pay more per ml for their smaller bottles. If you think this smells feminine due to the florals, or “grandmotherly” due to the powder, I don’t know what else to tell you. To me, it’s incredibly smooth, modern, clean, fresh, airy, creamy, rich, and woody, and sweet but not that typical cotton candy sweetness. It doesn’t even slightly resemble the type of perfumes (chypres, animalics, rose heavy florals) that usually get that association from younger or naive noses.

Take it as a fact – review the scent, not its price. We all know how much it costs. Yes, it is outrageous. But after all this is not made for people who care about the price anyway, so it’s completely irrelevant.  Now to the scent itself. To me this feels like having a bath full of fresh flowers and expensive essential oils made for you by your servants in your family chateau built in 18th century. You can smell powdery cleanness, citruses and aged sandalwood. Beautiful composition.  How powerful is it? When I first tested it I sprayed just a little on my wrist, not even a full spray and it easily filled the room, then it lasted for like 5 hours and even survived hot shower. 2 sprays is all I need for the whole day. So if you are one of those people who absolutely don’t care about money and enjoy feeling like someone who owns a castle (or you actually own one), get it – you will be thrilled.', 'Although Im a fan of Clive Christian, this is not so good. The floral is not masculine, and also not even a good smelling feminine. It’s like baby powder used to cover up pee when it comes, and it’s been coming for years now.  I keep sniffing it trying to change perspective and it just keeps delivering on the baby powder and pee essence (no, not straight urine, just kinda baked in).', ""To start I'll state the obvious: this is not worth the asking price. But that doesn't mean it's a bad perfume. It's quite a stunning and beautiful fragrance. Clive Christian No. 1 is a lot more than simply a powdery floral; there's a lot more going on here. I get touches of citrus which give it a balanced, airy tartness. I get ambery, musky warmth that gently radiates off the skin. I get very subtle spice and herbal notes in the blend. And the coup de gras - the 50 year old aged sandalwood is simply to die for. It is cozy, warm, radiant and rich.  If all you're used to is department store men's cologne, or you are relatively new to the fragrance world, No. 1 may be perceived as feminine leaning. But to my nose this really does smell like a rich men's perfume. I picture getting dressed up to go to the symphony or wearing this to a wedding. High class juice.  No. 1 uses very high-quality natural ingredients. It smells regal, dense and expensive. It is almost unbelievably well blended. On my wearings, No. 1 sits very close to the skin giving you a golden aura to those standing near you, and it is strong enough to leave a nice scent trail. That being said, the projection is very minimal, and longevity leaves a bit to be desired. (You can detect it on your skin almost all day, but it becomes a skin scent within 3-4 hours on me.) In summary, No.1 has some very strong positives and some minor negatives. Obviously do not pay retail for this ($790 for 50ml as of the time of this review). I was able to find a 50ml bottle for about $200, and to me, this is worth every penny of that."", 'Opening I get powder and a tiny bit of cola, ever so slightly medicinal. After a few hours it’s very floral. It certainly smells quality, just not for me. This one gets a «\xa0meh\xa0»', ""Wore this on a walk to the grocery store today. It smells pleasant in a soft breeze. At almost $800 retail, the assumption ought to be that it will smell pleasant, at the very least, right? However, it doesn't smell that pleasant, especially given what it purports to be: the masculine magnum opus of a high-dollar luxury perfume brand. First, I would never purchase a full bottle of this fragrance, without even taking its price into account. Second, taking its price into account, this fragrance is absolutely laughable. There is nothing about the smell of this fragrance that warrants its price tag. If you are going to make an extremely expensive halo fragrance (literally titled No. 1), it needs to be an absolute home run; this fragrance is barely a bunt. Finally, while I was in the store, I felt so self-conscious and avoided walking near anyone out of fear they might smell me and wonder why a young man is walking around wearing a grandmother's perfume. It's powdery and floral, with sandalwood and vanilla base notes. Think a Chanel No. 5-type fragrance, but slightly more modern and sweeter. I can't imagine a world in which anyone finds this fragrance to be remotely masculine; and for this, once again, to be your masculine MAGNUM OPUS... what was this brand thinking? Bottom line, sample this to say that you have, but not because you might otherwise miss out on a great fragrance. You won't. This is not that."", ""Obtained a 2ml vial of this perfume just to test what's the hype is all about. First impression of the smell: Luxurious. You know it's not one of those cheap perfumes; this belongs to the high society, easily upper class stuff. The potency & richness of the juice can be felt immediately. They don't skimp on the ingredients. Nothing synthetic or 'pharmacy perfume' vibe at all. Chanel-like quality. Secondly, although it's written on the bottle as 'oriental woody', it has a very floral scent. A good mixture of different type of flowers, but I can't pinpoint to any dominating note. I can imagine an elegant elderly woman, either an aristocrat or CEO wearing this on a formal ocassion. Young girls won't wear this; it's too 'mature', 'serious' and 'heavy' for them to carry it. No way this is a nightclub material, especially with that mild powdery drydown. Thirdly, yes you read it right, I mentioned about females. I find it amusing that this is categorised as a perfume for men. Put it on a blind test, I bet 90% of men would think this is a legit feminine profile. Wearing this would not accentuate your masculinity in any way.

As a young lady I find this scent quite mature, so I reserve it for special occasions. Clive Christian is a true artisan when it comes to classy perfumes.', 'No.1 by Clive Christian was the most expensive perfume in the world upon its initial release in 2001, and while it’s no longer the most expensive out there, it’s still hideously overpriced despite being a lovely scent.  Initially it opens quite aromatic with a green artemisia combined with warm spices of nutmeg, cardamom and pimento. This is paired with a strikingly contrasting lime and mandarin which are juicy and tangy. A soft floral heart joins this odd medley of notes - namely orris, ylang and lily-of-the-valley. As the citrus begins to dissipate, the warm spices linger and begin to blend very well with the powdery florals - before a soft, creamy base of sandalwood and sweet tonka bean begins to emerge. This is a beautifully masculine and gentlemanly fragrance which does indeed exude wealth and power, however it’s a fairly strange blend of notes which won’t be for everyone and I really can’t see why this is priced so highly apart from being a publicity stunt.', ""Clive Christian No 1 is truly a magnificent work of art. Like any masterpiece let it speak to you first. I don't get the negative reviews posted here. This is British perfumery at its best and reminds me somehow of the luxurious life of the rich people of the Victorian London. I tried this fragrance first about ten years back at the Clive Christian Dubai Mall boutique and have never been without it since then. My experience at the friendly Clive Christian boutique was amazing. I also saw a rich Shaikh buying Clive Christian No 1 and leave in a hurry. This was then (just as it is now) a hugely popular fragrance.  I have been to a number of nutmeg warehouses where I have crushed and smelled the nutmeg. The spicy smell is very good. The moment I open the box (without even opening the lid of the bottle) I get wafts of intoxicating nutmeg, cardamom and florals. This opens with a heavenly, refined blast of finest cardamom, nutmeg and florals. Nutmeg & florals here remain prominent throughout. Aged Mysore sandalwood adds a great deal of depth to the perfume. Age has brought so many mellowed, aromatic changes in sandalwood as is evident here. This perfume will certainly get compliments for you. One spritz from the bottle on the sleeve and even after a wash it smells like some heavenly powder. Just make sure you buy from a very trusted source Expensive? Yep. Sadly the finest things in life are expensive."", 'I bought this perfume for my husband because of how impressed I was with this scent. I wear it from sometimes when I want to feel extremely powerful and Royal. The price is crazy but the scent is worth having even if it is the 10mls. I remember the first time some guys in my church smelt this perfume. When I applied one spray on one of the guys in the morning, he called me later in the evening to tell me that when he got home and hugged his Mum, she told him he smelt like a wealthy man.

A subtle soapiness and pleasant sweetness carries itself throughout the fragrance.  Rich vetiver, cardamom and various other spices give the scent an intensely green, herbal undertone. The spices and woody backdrop as well as the indolic quality to the floral notes prevent them from being too vibrant.  No. 1 has an inherently vintage character yet to my nose it is still modern-smelling and relevant. The fragrance is unapologetically floral and heady for one that is marketed specifically for men but I quite like that unisex appeal. This scent will most likely not be for every man and requires an open-mindedness. The drydown lends itself to the sensuality of amber, copious amount of powdery musk and smoky sandalwood which round up the whole composition seamlessly with patchouli and a lick of creamy vanilla.

The middle notes are pretty dang apparent at first spray and the first 20ish minutes; however, the base and top notes start showing up after that half hour mark on my skin, and boy is it amazing. I love the complexity of the notes - somehow, they all work just so beautifully well. I implore everyone to at least try a sample spray or two of this. Really, you only need one or two sprays. Seriously, it wears well, and does a fine job projecting. Moms like it, dads like it, grammies like it, grampies like it, dudes like it, gals like it, your dog likes it. Just get it!"", 'No.1 Masculine by Clive Christian, is a type of scent I did not expect to smell like is does. Upon spraying it on my first thought was ""Hmm I accidentely got the feminine version"" (since the Original Collection by Clive Christian had a Masculine and Feminine fragrance for every scent). Because it opens up with strong florals. Eventhough the top notes arent florals, the florals are the frontrunners from the start. Especially the Iris and Ylang-Ylang are the main players here, creating this enourmous clean soapy bubble. There are some spices listed and citrusses. The citrusses are only present in the start which give the scent the floral overdose, very supporting in this role. And after these fade, the spice show up. The floral soapy vibe is always present and at the foreground, but you can smell the spices in the back. It almost turns into a fougere type of fragrance. The base notes of sandalwood, amber, vanilla, musk, tonka, vetiver and cedar wood create the warmer, ambery dry down that is still soapy and powdery. Its a unique scent for a man. Unique since there arent many florals marketed towards men. I dont think many will like it though, it requires a special type of taste and and special type of style to pull this off! It will definitely impress those around you though, since this is a power scent!', 'This perfume is just dreadful! It gives me a similar sensation I got from Jaïpur Homme (not that they smell the same) in that it reeks of baby talcum powder with flowers and civet...a man is crazy if he wants to smell like this! Plus, a 50 ml. bottle sells for $600, which is an utter, ludicrous joke. What are they thinking? Conclusion: I\'d rather rub cat\'s pee on my body than wear this abomination. It should be renamed ""No. 1 Scrub-off.""', 'Last year I bought two 10ml bottles for the princely sum of £35 each. Now you can only buy the 50ml bottle for £525. Absolute joke that anyone would dare pay that price.', 'I just spilled half of my vtg sample, so I figured I might as well review it. Opens with a soapy quasi aldehydic LOTV citrus ylang-ylang combo. To give you an idea, if Chanel were to come up with something for the royals, it would probably smell similar to this. It\'s classic, not manly or blue or Fougere, but if a man wears this you just know he is something else. I honestly don\'t think any man can pull this off, as this can come across as grandma-ish, as the materials suggest it would.  If you go and drink a Dom Perignon and your next thought is: ""Did I just pay 400 bucks for a bottle of this?"" then this is not for you. The ingredients are top-notch quality, but they are built in a very refined way. Before the fragrance gives way to its heart, it turns slightly herbal and spicy without popping the bubble of soapiness. Then, you get a big iris/sandalwood/heliotrope, and then some rose. An amber starts to rise right after, and it\'s gorgeous. At this stage, the million bucks man is fully developed. There is something about floral ambers that scream luxury (1888 Xerjoff), and this is a hyper balanced aldehydic floral ambery treat with some woody backbone.  Regarding the price, you can find this in the 200-300 range easily, and compared to so many other luxe frags out there, the price is fair if you\'re purchasing a vintage. I wouldn\'t bother with the newer ones as they already went under L\'Oreal cost-cutting regimes.', ""I have the suspicion this has been reformulated. I bought a full bottle of this back in 2015 that I resold and I recently got a sample of this, and it smells different.  I remember this scent smelling like a million dollar man. Powerful, confident, oozing luxury and good taste. Now it's... so watered down and rather feminine.  Can anyone confirm?"", ""Update: I've neglected wear this one for a while because I thought it wasn't great for Summer, but I wanted to break it back out. Man, I've missed it! I fell in love all over! THE best longevity of all fragrances I own! Projects great for at least 7 hours in heat, and it's a skin scent (a strong one at that) until you wash it off. Had it on almost 12 hours yesterday, and it was gorgeous all day! Felt like I should've had a pinstripe suit on instead, though. So pretty when first sprayed, although a little mature, but that wood that rolls in after is just wonderful. I never want to be without at least a 10 mL of this in my collection! Luckily, I've got a full bottle. It's so strong that it will last a looooong time because you have to apply so sparingly so you don't knock everyone out. Still 10/10 on every front for me!"", ""At first I wasn't sure. But the dry down it's like extra notes come out. Love it one of my faves. Smells old school distinguished gentlemen type.

Lasts very very long."", ""I've not been terribly impressed with the fragrances I've sampled from this house until this. This calls back to a whole different era in my imagination, a land before aqua scents where fresh was of no concern, and scents were captivating. This blend is magical, piercing the senses with a huge floral opening that smells very genuine, like a rare exotic jungle flower that is large and stands alone, emitting a warm, musky, yet pungent aroma bordering on pheromone. It dries into a most luxurious sandalwood with a slightly soapy or waxy floral note, like the smell of angel trumpet. A touch of tonka engages the wood, and the whole composition borders on too busy with it's epic palette, but holds together the whole way. Utterly elegant and seductive, this seems to me like it would be incredible on a woman's skin, it's very floral for a men's fragrance. Masterpiece."", 'It smells like the highest level of luxury and elegance. A perfect blend of floral,woody, spicy and powdery notes. A bit ""over the top"" floral in the start, but the magic comes in the drydown after 20-30 minutes. A nice, classy attire is required.', 'Got a small, very nicely priced decant. My first impression is Georgio Beverly Hills for Men, circa 1988. That\'s not a bad thing if you remember what it used to smell like (they still make it, modern formulation is a complete fraud). I swear it seems like some of today\'s expensive niche frags are what we used to be able to get at designer prices. Other examples include Original Santal (old Joop) and Beau du Jour (old Drakkar).  Edit (three months later): This stuff is truly fantastic, just the ultimate that I\'ve ever tried. Takes a bit getting used to but the floral opening is so rich it just doesn\'t bother me and of course the dry down is epic. I\'m not impressed by the price, I have no problem calling so many other CC\'s trash and X, while very nice, is not on par with the other two of the CC ""Big Three"" IMO. My point is this lives up to they hype. It performs well and smells divine. I\'ve found multiple decants in the $125-$150 oz range and it\'s worth every penny of that and more...', 'An authorized CC store decided to quit carrying the brand, and they cut prices in half. Combining with some coupon codes and rewards points, I purchased 4 from the brand (1872, No. 1, Rock Rose, and X) for much more relatively reasonable prices because I doubted I\'d ever get an opportunity to get shady eBay-like deals from a real boutique--no worry of authenticity or spoilage. Got this 50 mL for $382.50, normally $850-$865. I feel like that\'s worth mentioning. The box is identical to the others in the original collection, just a gold outer-box. Disappointing for a fragrance that\'s over double the cost. The bottle is a lovely gold glass. Only a slight imperfection at the bottom corner of my bottle--like a dent, which is ridiculous to have at this price. You can only tell if you\'re holding the bottle and looking at the bottom or looking from the right angle when it\'s sat down. This aside, picking up the bottle feels special; I\'m lucky to have this! I heavily debated on buying this, even at the ""good deal"" that I was getting. The first time I tried it, I thought it was straight old lady Chanel No. 5. As it settled in, I was on the fence. Then I tried it again, and this time got a heavily sprayed tester card to put in my car. That sold me. It was just so wonderful that I had that ""Okay, I get it"" moment. NO regrets buying this! Haters of this often likely can\'t afford it, want to talk it down, and probably go into smelling it without an objective nose. If you appreciate nicer things, you\'re going to appreciate this; it smells expensive without a doubt, even if the scent isn\'t quite your cup of tea. This is a scent for a dapper gentleman, which I like to pretend to be. This pairs perfectly with my finest suit, and it adds that perfect next level to stand out. It\'s the perfect amount of floral that ties in so nicely with the woody notes. Then there\'s just a hint of powder that tickles the nose to make this smooth--almost as if it\'s a bridge in the middle to join the floral and woody notes. It just keeps getting better all day. This is my confidence fragrance, which every man needs. Putting this on makes me feel like I need to be stepping into a Ferrari driving into London to broker a large contract, not a Jeep Cherokee heading into Jackson, Mississippi. You come to like the opening, which is granted a tiny bit old lady, but that phase only lasts about 10-40 minutes or so. Then it\'s just the most heavenly cloud of luxurious woody notes with a masculine floral. It\'s not sharp; it\'s suave. I don\'t think anyone could say it stinks. There may be a few people who don\'t like it, but you won\'t get anyone who just plain turns his or her nose up at you--or covers it. You only need a VERY small amount. I spray around a half spray on the wrist and behind the ear, and I\'m good for the day. This is very potent and intoxicating stuff. It\'s good year round I think, but it\'s going to shine best in any season but Summer. Don\'t get me wrong, I still have worn it a lot this Summer without regret and have loved it, but it\'s probably going to be even better when the temperature drops. Longevity is incredible, usually 10-12 hours or longer--often longer. It gets closer to the skin after about 6 hours, and really becomes closer to a skin scent after about 8 or so. I\'ve only had this for the hot and humid MS summer, so I can\'t comment fully on performance yet since my skin eats perfume when it\'s hot. However, it\'s performed very well for the conditions. Is this full bottle worthy? I think so. At $850? If you have the money and appreciate finer things enough and have run out of other fragrances that don\'t have you bored, then yes. Would I buy it at $850? No, I honestly wouldn\'t. Clive Christian directly sells a 10 mL for $95; I\'ll get that if I ever run out. I think that\'s not an awful price for this fragrance--especially since you must use it sparingly. I never want to be without this one again! 10/10 scent--very unique, 10/10 longevity, 10/10 sillage--very engulfing.', 'If you want to buy gold and diamond, go buy gold and diamond :D', 'I’m confused.

I am wearing it because it's been on me for Thanksgiving as a friend of mine gave it to me as a gift but I'm going to wrap it up and make it into a Christmas present for a friend. This is not my type of perfume. I hate to write a critically negative review and always find at least one thing to like about a fragrance. But this time there were too many dislikes. First of all the price ranges from 800 and up, and frankly I'd rather smell of an Avon perfume, or Stetson by Coty LOL This fragrance is dull and predictable and it's only merit is the unisex body. The top notes consist of citruses: sharp mandarin orange peel, and grapefruit galore. Fresh and sweet, with paprika mingling with grapefruit & spices of caraway and nutmeg. The scent smells fruity-spicy-floral. The floral heart is composed of rose, lily of the valley, ylang ylang heliotrope and jasmine. These flowers are normally found in women's fragrances. I don't think the flowers are interesting enough nor complex. There is no rose scent or heliotrope. I get mostly ylang ylang and a bit of jasmine. The florals seem to turn into a powder for a little bit.  Before long the masculine notes appear in the dry down which is where the base notes make their appearance. Vetiver, musk, and woodsy notes. This is a somewhat aromatic and woodsy vanilla dry down. But still it's not enough to get me excited. I prefer the dry down to something like Aramis Devin. This is woodsy but the florals and the fruit are the major players. Some men will find this too feminine. For it's price and all the hype, it's not worth it. There are much better frags from quality and expensive houses like CREED KILIAN and TOM FORD. So stick to any of those houses for better fragrances at pricy prices. This stuff is not worth the price or the packaging. This is the opposite of some great drug store fragrances like Emeraude which smell expensive at a cheap price. This stuff smells CHEAP AT AN EXPENSIVE PRICE.  I'm done."", ""A scent full of contrasts. For men yet feminine leaning and defined by its wonderful floral heart. Fresh yet indolic with prominent ylang, powdery iris and heliotrope. Gentle musky woods lead the floral bouquet into soft oriental territory. Very much like Roja's Britannia, No1 is a scent for a self-assured and relaxed gentleman who enjoys the more delicate, sweeter, floriental side of perfume art. There is a fine air of Chanel as well and an overall vintage touch telling stories of better times: a bygone age where gentle mannerism was the expression of masculinity and kindness, restrained temperament and generosity of a man were valued as his greatest assets. No1 is not a perfume to show off with; haters would never understand that No1 is not worn to brag but out of respect toward one's company - be it for afternoon tea, or being Best Man. The strength of No1 is just perfect; everpresent like an aura and as reliable a company as one's own shadow.  Very much the perfect scent because it gives back so much."", ""The best way I can describe this is that it smells almost like a unisex or woman's perfume that becomes a man's cologne when it dries down. The opening notes is very floral and smell strongly of jasmine, then when it dries down in an hour or two, it becomes very masculine with the woody notes. Longevity is long lasting and sillage is moderate on me. I'll wear this in the summer where it can dry down faster. It really does smell nice once it dries down, but I don't think it justifies the price.

I don\'t know whether it\'s because my senses have changed or maybe it\'s that I never gave this scent a chance. Personally, I think this scent is misunderstood and it needs to be worn in a certain way. If your reviews/opinions on this scent are based on the first 10 minutes of its development, then you\'re not going to be satisfied. If you wear this on a cold, winter day, or evening, then you\'re probably not going to experience the pinnacle of its peak.  It is true, that the opening of this scent does resemble an ""old grandma perfume"". This scent is expensive ""ridiculously overpriced"". I think because these tend to be two of the most common reviews about No.1, it turns people off. With preconceived perceptions such as those, you\'re almost guaranteed to dislike it before you\'ve even given it a chance. I\'m not going to give you a breakdown of how this smells to me. A scent like this needs to be experienced. The best information I can provide you with is to buy a 1ml sample and try it on during the warm summer months or in warmer hemispheres/climates. I\'ve had women who have smelled this on a test strip and found it to be absolutely repulsing and I\'ve also had the very same women smell it on me and have commented ""OMG what are you wearing, you smell amazing"". Like I said get a sample... Pick a hot day or a tropical environment and wear it. I suggest applying it sparingly because too much will be a little over powering to the wearer. I would say this scent is more fitting for men ages 30-50. Give it a chance. Don\'t be distracted by its price or the first 10 mins of applying.', ""This fragrance represents the absolute disappointment.

He was planning to sell the kidneys. ""Atheist man should smell like, looks great,"" he said to me. I think that Muslim men should use it.', ""The composition opens with a hesperidic burst utilizing bergamot, lime, and Sicilian mandarin, which are gently mixed with spices of cardamom, nutmeg, caraway, and artemisia. The opening is certainly robust, and dare I say cloying and somewhat off putting initially. Heady florals dominate the second phase of Clive Christian's 'No. 1'. Muguet, rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, iris and heliotrope create a floral bouquet which initially rings very feminine for a male branded fragrance. Within this floral accord it is the exotic and indolent ylang-ylang which pierces through most prominently. Its searing yellow-floral scent is tamed by the powdery heliotrope and iris. In the base cedar, sandalwood, vetiver, amber, tonka bean and vanilla create a warm, sensuality. One is still able to notice the proceeding sweet florals, yet their femininity has been subdued by the musky, woody basenotes. It is here that the fragrance is at its most captivating.  For me, Clive Christian's 'No. 1' is all about contradictions. Here is a masculine fragrance utilizing an abundance of feminine florals. It is at once fresh and hesperidic, and then rich and oriental. Initially clean, powdery and later somewhat dirty and indolic. Unabashedly luxurious and original, I am hard pressed to compare 'No. 1' to any previously experienced fragrance of recent memory. Both elegant and refined, this composition seems perfect to be worn for a special and/or formal occasion. Its sillage, projection, and longevity are superb upon initial application, becoming average after one hour into the dry down. Due to its over reliance of floral heart notes, this can easily be considered unisex and worn by women. Many men may find it too feminine to personally own. I must admit my first reaction to smelling 'No. 1' was not a pleasant one. I found the overly harsh and cloying citrus, floral opening to be garish and obtrusive. With patience, the fragrance magically transformed itself into something quite beautiful after 30-60 minutes. I've learned to never again judge another scent based upon the initial few seconds after it being sprayed. Certainly it must live and breathe upon the skin first, allowing its full splendor to unfurl itself for our senses to adequately behold in its finest.

Maybe i got a fake set, so will be taking a trip down to Harrods and test it there.

It is difficult for me to be amazed the way I was many moons ago when giants like Dior Homme was fisrt sniffed. I thought it is a long lost sensation, until I tried this perfume, No.1 for Men. Now when you brand a perfume as the WORLD\'S MOST EXPENSIVE fragrance, you will almost immediately get haters. Guilty as charged I was one of them, sceptical as ever. Never really gave this fragrance a chance to prove itself in retrospect, until recently when I was strolling in the mail waiting for my lady (eternity by definition), I walked past a shelf of Clive and so thought, what the hell, and picked up No.1 Men, dosed myself a spray expecting nothing more than another disappointment. To my surprise, I was wow-ed.  This fragrance began with a lush of florals that transported me back to the Victorian era. I can almost see the nobles and royals mingling around each another. It is very pleasant and I started smelling myself non-stop. Dashed another spray to my chest and there it is again! Simply beautiful. A gentleman\'s scent truely. When I rejoined with my lady the first thing she said was this, word for word in awe, ""what magic did you spray, because you need more!"" I had another compliment by a stranger as we rode the lift down to the carpark. Then another one as at the ticket booth. By the end of the day, it was clear; this has to be purchased. Mind you I live in Asia, where people don\'t even apologise let alone compliment a stranger, so it was a huge shocker for me to land so many in 1 day, with 3 sprays of No.1. Now I understand the primary concern behind this fragrance; its crazy price. Almost around 12usd/ml. But if you are reading this, this means you are considering, so hear me out: don\'t walk away, there are cheaper options! I bought a tester bottle from UAE for 8usd/ml. Came with cap too. There was another listing for 6usd/ml but the mail was slightly too much for my destination. Bottomline, you can definitely get it cheaper. Do not give up on this fragrance like I did, for it is truly, No.1.', ""Okay so it's ridiculously priced but lets just get past that gimmick and judge it on it's merits. It has real merits! Boy does this thing smell good and unique the note progression changes by the second right under your nose, a true sign of quality and complexity. No.1 is so complex in fact it's hard to pick out the notes Ylang ylang is distinctive in the top notes and sandalwood is obvious but the rest is a curious floral, amber and strong musk mixture. The drydown is nice and soft but deep and long lasting as you'd expect. I for one like No.1 because it's very interesting but I'm not crazy about it either.  The unfortunate thing about the price it is another factor that it rules me out of ever buying it. It's above the threshold of what I deem to be exceptable for 50mls of fragrance but it's all relative if you love it and can afford it."", 'I dont know?? Gosh, feed an entire needy country... Or wear this perfume? Absolutely laughable. Hey I have $9000.00 shoe laces I should sell.', 'Normally I would add some humor to my reviews to keep you reading along. But this is some seriously expensive fragrance people are buying here. All I can really say is if you want to buy a car for over $100,000 or $10,000 for a gold ring then go for it. For around $800 or $1200 No. 1 Clive Christian is a nice fragrance but I admit I rarely wear it. I got it for free yet it just sits there more like a decoration or trophy on my counter rather than a cologne. The longevity and sillage are average at best although lately its been pushing above average...like if my body is evolving and getting used to the scent.  The smell is a bit overwhelming by floral notes but thank goodness the warm spices do kick in after the initial spray. The sandalwood and nutmeg I recognize a mile away and it sticks around between 4 to 6 hours on my skin before it wears out. It is very unique and I admit none of my colognes smell like this... but elegant? Maybe I do not know what elegance smells like but overall a good scent. Is it worth the extra money? Sadly in my opinion no but if you got the cash to burn then get it! For now I will stick to my Creed Aventus and the much cheaper Magman. 8 out of 10', 'تستر کلیه محصولات کلیو با کیفیتی بیشتر از عادیش،با حجم 50 میل و بهای تقریبا نصف عادیش موجود میباشد...در صورت تمایل به خرید لطفا پیغام بگذارید', 'I did not loose my head over “Clive Christian No.1 for Men”. This perfume, this house is legendary for having a reputation of being the most exclusive and expensive perfume in all the land. Regal and extravagant in its presentation in a golden Baccarat crystal bottle topped with a five carat diamond it is indeed a very beautiful package fit for a king. It received the 2006 FIFI award for packaging and presentation and deservedly so. Alas I found what comes in that sumptuous bottle to be an empty olfactory experience. The banquet hall is deserted. The king is dead.  It is not a bad scent by any means but simply ordinary and fleeting at best in longevity. On my skin it dies in its youth lasting at most an hour. At these prices heads should roll for not living up to the hype.  The house claims to use the very best and most expensive of ingredients and I am sure they do but these notes do not come together with anything original, memorable or remarkable. The fragrance opens in a citrus and spice blend of lime, Mandarin Orange, grapefruit, and cardamom, nutmeg, artemisia, caraway that comes off to me as a simple orangeade soda pop. This fizzles out within seconds of hitting the skin. The central notes of rose, lily of the valley, iris, ylang-ylang and heliotrope is simply a floral muddle to my nose. It struggles to bloom only do wither into my skin so swiftly as to make it near impossible for me to explore and enjoy what should be happening at this point. There is hardly a dry down where there are supposed to be notes of vanilla, Virginia cedar, vetiver, Tonka bean, musk and sandalwood. My skin very rarely eats a fragrance alive but on every testing of No.1 it swallowed the fragrance in one hungry gulp.  There are other Clive Christian perfumes out there to be explored and I do hope to find one that is more giving and generous than No.1 has proven to be. We shall see if the house of Clive Christian does have a perfume worthy of a king’s ransom. If not, then off with his head!  CLIVE CHRISTIAN NO.1 3 BRONZE STARS (TWO FOR PRESENTATION, ONE FOR FRAGRANCE) (For the story behind my review check out my fragrance blog Scents Memory)', 'Sampled it the other day. MAJOR disappointment. Yes, I can smell the expensive, good quality ingredients, but you can still be a \'bull in a china shop\' and to me it is very unharmonious and rather jarring, like the orchestra rehearsing amongst themselves before the concert starts. You can tell the individual notes/ quality ingredients but they do not ""sing from the same hymn sheet"". Amouage ""Gold"" does a better story-telling IMHO. 4/10. :-(', ""EDIT: How wrong was I when I thought CC1 for Men was not my cup of tea back in March 2013. After getting the travel set consisting 10ml of it and wearing it for a few times, I would say CC1 for Men is perfectly the kind of fragrances I enjoy and love. I want more and seriously thinking of getting a 50ml bottle as soon as I finish my 10ml bottle. (March 21, 2014) *********************************************** I smell high quality ingredients in this fragrance and understand why it is so expensive, which can be of many reasons; however, it is just not what I want. On the other hand, CC1 for Women is everything and it is so good that I bought it at the spot. I didn't get the full size bottle then as US$850/50ml was really too much to spend on one fragrance but did get the travel set of 10ml each of 1872 and X and No 1 for women for US$250, which is more affordable. As a lover of CC fragrances and happy owner of C for men, X for men, No 1 for women, 1872 for women and X for women, IMO I think No 1 for men is just too 'manly' to my taste. I'm by no mean saying No 1 for men is not a good fragrance as it is just not me. However, I must point out that CC fragrances are made with mostly high quality natural ingredients and they need time to develop on your skin. You would be amazed how some of CC fragrances developed or I should say opened after you had them on for a few hours."", ""Sooooo being a complete fragrance junkie, I ordered the 3 sample sizes just to try this. Well, it is lovely, and while I'm not as adept as explaining all different notes I will try to explain my experience on day 1. Boy, I was excited to get this box! I couldn't rip the cellophane off quick enough. I grabbed that gold bottle! SPRAY!! Yes, yes, yes....it's very good, very lovely, very rich.....but....and I hate to have to add the but, because we all don't want a big but :D Anyways, I've had it on about 6 hours now, and I can't smell it on me, but perhaps others can. I will test it one day when I am out and about and see if I get compliments. To me, for 800 bucks for a FB, there is NO WAY I am ever going to pay that. It's just not that unique. To my nose and experience and reaction to the juice, I found that Gold by Amouage is much better. That's my story and I'm sticking to it. I suppose if you are married to a rock star, or a socialite then you can wear this. Even if I were in that status, there's many more gems out there that smell rich and lovely i.e. Amouage line. Give them a try. I would say Gold comes close to this, even better. I see the first review says it smells like Bvlgari pour Femme, and it does sort of to my nose.

After dry down No.1 is far too floral for me to be a male fragrance, for me anyway, that said after an hour to 3hrs No.1 is at it\'s best, then quickly fades away far too soon, all in all a bit one dimensional also for my liking with the prominent floral notes employed. I must say It\'s 1872, or ""X"" in the old CC\'s for me or even more so with the new generation of CC\'s, ""V"" or ""C"" have lasting power, that fully excite my senses and more than justify the price tag. ************************************************************************************ Update further to my above review and my personal dislike, my daughter as now taken my No.1 for men and she likes it.

Combining with some coupon codes and rewards points, I purchased 4 from the brand (1872, No. 1, Rock Rose, and X) for much more relatively reasonable prices because I doubted I\'d ever get an opportunity to get shady eBay-like deals from a real boutique--no worry of authenticity or spoilage. Got this 50 mL for $382.50, normally $850-$865. I feel like that\'s worth mentioning. The box is identical to the others in the original collection, just a gold outer-box. Disappointing for a fragrance that\'s over double the cost. The bottle is a lovely gold glass. Only a slight imperfection at the bottom corner of my bottle--like a dent, which is ridiculous to have at this price. You can only tell if you\'re holding the bottle and looking at the bottom or looking from the right angle when it\'s sat down. This aside, picking up the bottle feels special; I\'m lucky to have this! I heavily debated on buying this, even at the ""good deal"" that I was getting. The first time I tried it, I thought it was straight old lady Chanel No. 5. As it settled in, I was on the fence. Then I tried it again, and this time got a heavily sprayed tester card to put in my car. That sold me. It was just so wonderful that I had that ""Okay, I get it"" moment. NO regrets buying this! Haters of this often likely can\'t afford it, want to talk it down, and probably go into smelling it without an objective nose. If you appreciate nicer things, you\'re going to appreciate this; it smells expensive without a doubt, even if the scent isn\'t quite your cup of tea. This is a scent for a dapper gentleman, which I like to pretend to be. This pairs perfectly with my finest suit, and it adds that perfect next level to stand out. It\'s the perfect amount of floral that ties in so nicely with the woody notes. Then there\'s just a hint of powder that tickles the nose to make this smooth--almost as if it\'s a bridge in the middle to join the floral and woody notes. It just keeps getting better all day. This is my confidence fragrance, which every man needs. Putting this on makes me feel like I need to be stepping into a Ferrari driving into London to broker a large contract, not a Jeep Cherokee heading into Jackson, Mississippi. You come to like the opening, which is granted a tiny bit old lady, but that phase only lasts about 10-40 minutes or so. Then it\'s just the most heavenly cloud of luxurious woody notes with a masculine floral. It\'s not sharp; it\'s suave. I don\'t think anyone could say it stinks. There may be a few people who don\'t like it, but you won\'t get anyone who just plain turns his or her nose up at you--or covers it. You only need a VERY small amount. I spray around a half spray on the wrist and behind the ear, and I\'m good for the day. This is very potent and intoxicating stuff. It\'s good year round I think, but it\'s going to shine best in any season but Summer. Don\'t get me wrong, I still have worn it a lot this Summer without regret and have loved it, but it\'s probably going to be even better when the temperature drops. Longevity is incredible, usually 10-12 hours or longer--often longer. It gets closer to the skin after about 6 hours, and really becomes closer to a skin scent after about 8 or so. I\'ve only had this for the hot and humid MS summer, so I can\'t comment fully on performance yet since my skin eats perfume when it\'s hot. However, it\'s performed very well for the conditions. Is this full bottle worthy? I think so. At $850? If you have the money and appreciate finer things enough and have run out of other fragrances that don\'t have you bored, then yes. Would I buy it at $850? No, I honestly wouldn\'t. Clive Christian directly sells a 10 mL for $95; I\'ll get that if I ever run out. I think that\'s not an awful price for this fragrance--especially since you must use it sparingly. I never want to be without this one again! 10/10 scent--very unique, 10/10 longevity, 10/10 sillage--very engulfing.', ""I've ordered all 3 Clive Christian perfumes directly from CC website.

Top notes are Eucalyptus, Citruses, Grapefruit and Tangerine; middle notes are Nutmeg and Pepper; base notes are Pine Tree, Cedar, Incense and Vetiver.

The opening notes of juicy citruses, mainly oranges and grapefruit, are accented with a beautifully smooth eucalyptus note. I'm reminded of some walks I've taken in the Northwest California coast, particularly how I felt the first time I did so, where the marine air carries the smell of the eucalyptus trees across your skin in a slightly sticky and salty way. Combined with the wide breadth of citrus notes, there's this feeling of a huge expanse stretched out in front of you. 1828 is making me feel the way I felt during that first walk through a coastal eucalyptus forest - the smell of the trees, the ocean you can hear before you can see it, to finally emerge from the tree line and see the Pacific in front of you. I can't recall the last time I smelled a perfume whose opening felt so enormous, but without clobbering you over the head. For as big as it feels, it's not terribly powerful and overwhelming - just like looking out at the ocean from the shore, you get a sense of enormity and power without having to experience that power in full. It's an absolutely brilliant opening to a perfume.  As these top notes begin to dry down you get this feeling of descent. The perfume begins to close-in on itself and get really tight by projecting earthy seed spice notes of nutmeg and cinnamon, yet it's a black pepper note - slightly fruity, spicy and piquant, round and glass-like - that gives the effect of your environment closing in around you. You're walking into the forest, dense and tight, visibility to nil. Or, you're descending into the bowels of the Earth through a tight cave as Jules Verne would have imagined. But before this becomes a bit overwhelming and unsettling, the perfume moves quickly through these heart notes to bring forth airy and luminescent pine, myrrh, and vetiver. After the experience of the heart notes you really get the feeling of a breath of fresh air and openness with these base notes, like I've just passed through the center of the Earth from the eucalyptus forests of California to come out the other side somewhere in Asia. The vetiver is typical vetiver, a bit wet, salty, swampy, and very green, but the pine and myrrh notes, which lock hand-in-hand incredibly well, are so effervescent and breathable that the vetiver doesn't come across as overtly swampy and close. The pine and myrrh allow the vetiver's more challenging aspects to actually be refreshing rather than cloying. Nothing in the base scratches at you or challenges you; it refreshes you, relaxes you while maintaining the energy of excitement that got you started - your amazing journey is over, now time to reflect.  I am absolutely bowled over by 1828. Every stage is unique yet cohesively stitched together to be exciting and evocative, but never feels less than sophisticated and gentlemanly. Full marks to Sylvie Jourdet for a brilliant composition. At the end of the day, yes, this is another citrus and woody vetiver - one of a million. In that sense it is not anything special. But every single note played by this perfume is pitch perfect, perfectly timed, and of a high-quality timbre. It's that execution that allows me to go on a journey with it, one I would be very happy to repeat."", 'Smells amazing but performance is 1/10', 'I hate gendering scents, but I will say this has the connotations of ""traditionally masculine"" written all over it. Wear whatever smells good on you, but it smells like a classy dad scent to me, which is a vibe that doesn\'t need to be pulled off by actual classy dads.  The blend of citrus, nutmeg, and pepper, make for a lightly citrus spicy opening, which is pretty long lasting. I really don\'t get eucalyptus. I wouldn\'t describe this as camphoric at all. The drydown is extremely smooth. It\'s so well blended than honestly none of the basenotes really stand out. I\'d say it\'s more warm than dry, maybe very very lightly sweet. Definitely not incense-y in the sense of smoky or strong, and the wood notes are subtle and not sharp.  I think this is masterfully balanced, which is something I look for. Also the projection and longevity are better than I expected after reading other reviews.  Scent: 9/10 Longevity: 8/10 Projection: 8/10 Full bottle? I had a sample and bought a 60ml shortly after. Definitely worth it!', 'My first thought upon sniffing this is “Dad would love this!” He probably wouldn’t; I shudder to think what would happen if I actually bought him a $210 bottle of perfume. But the bone-dry abstract cologne opening of 1828 reminds me of something my dad used to wear when I was a kid. And, as such, it gives me an unbelievably powerful scent memory. All’s right with the world, you are being hugged by your Daddy who knows how to do everything, who can draw a horse with realistic musculature and speaks every language in the world and knows things about cars and airplanes… more prosaically, it’s a dry, crisp, gray-green, classically abstract masculine scent chord. Luca Turin calls it “direct, effortless, virile elegance” and he’s right. there’s a sort of late-90’s “hi-tech” radiance about the aromachemicals — it was released in 2001, after all— and some commenters think it smells like cK One. In my book, that’s no bad thing; there’s nothing wrong with clean, crisp aromachemicals if they’re done right, and (say it with me now) The 90s Were Good Actually. a few minutes in, 1828 has a warmer, mellower creamy-spicy brown nuance (the nutmeg?) complementing the dry bitter pale-green opening. and half an hour in, there’s a pale coumarin (tonka?) glow underlying the whole thing…while it still retains its dry crisp freshness and aura of masculine expertise. An hour in, 1828 has landed, in a creamy-spicy (yet still light and radiant) coumarin-nutmeg place, ivory flecked with copper. It reminds me slightly of the cheerful masculine vanilla-tonka note in The Third Man; it’s innocent, honest joy, a guy whistling unselfconsciously in the bright air.', 'I want to like it. There’s a bottle available at a reasonable price…  But… Iso E, pepper, nutmeg, vetivetyl acetate… yawn. Even if made with the best sources available in the hands of an experienced perfumer.  It goes from escape, to Nina Ricci’s Mémoire d’Homme, to ck One, to their own 1725…  Well, I’m trying to control my impulses, cause even with that kind of discount, I don’t think it’s worth the plata… Lord, have mercy upon my collector’s soul.', 'Bought a tester and absolutely love it! A must-have for old-school enthusiasts—regal, distinguished, and top-notch quality. The opening is a beautifully balanced blend of eucalyptus, camphor, and sweet citrus, seamlessly anchored by a subtle yet formidable leather and patchouli base. Definitely signature scent-worthy!', ""A great fougere with lots of pine and woods. Has freah eucalyptus and citruses mixed in, and a big dose of a glorious nutmeg. Has a soapy touch, but not generic soap. All of the ingredients are of high quality and the fragrance is masterly blended. A beautiful Tangerine shows up more throughout the weartime.  Spring, summer and fall fragrance. Daytime wear, but night time capable. Great for work and casual wear, but will easily work for fully formal events too. Classy and very wearable. Probably best suited for men at the age range 30's and up.  Personal score: 7.75/10. A great fougere with a uplifting feel to it. I'd happily wear this, any day, any time. But I'm not a big fougere guy."", ""This doesn't smell like concrete. Unless your concrete is somehow full of classy perfume.  I am a construction project manager so I know what concrete smells like (or shouldn't). I wish concrete smelled like this. I wear this scent often. To work, funnily enough. No, this is what you smell like when you exfoliate your handsome manly face with a fistful of eucalyptus leaves and pinecones before swiping the wreckage off with a smashed lemon and finishing it all off with a splash of gin to the kisser.

Top notch stuff."", ""Some below said it smells like concrete. I get that. It's like a light dust or something, real smooth and comforting, like walking into a hardware store or maybe what I imagine a stone quarry might smell like.  1725 dna, but green.

Try as it might, but the world can never quiet your spirit. So many places, people, treasures lay undiscovered. So many things lie dormant, unknown to most, but not all. They are calling you, and you must go.', 'Lovely light citrus with prominent nutmeg contrasted by a subtle pine in the background. Mediocre performance', 'Great scent, but redundant if you own Dunhill Edition or Cacharel PH.', ""The male version of Santal 33 imo. It's surprisingly nice and not so masculine on me -- leans more neutral? Very green vetiver but a bit nuanced with almost mint. Not a buy but definitely intriguing. I was expecting something heavier but this is incredibly wearable and doesn't feel like it has a gender."", 'UPDATE: Been using this in the last few days. Masculine for sure. I would consider this office/business/professional setting safe, or daytime events. Easy to wear. Not for date night IMO. Citrus is there but I find the eucalyptus more forward, progresses to some vetiver as time passes. Smells of quality and runs a bit traditional.  Very nice. In the fougere territory but more citrus. Green too. If you like Creed Green Irish Tweed you might like this too.', '1828 opens with such a strong citrus note, I could see a three dimensional lemon in my mind. It feels masculine right from the start, with notes of wood and Vétiver in the background of the citrus. Then eucalyptus comes to play, and it gets very aromatic and camphoraceous. It reminds me a bit of a shower steamer you might want to use if you weren’t feeling well at this point, but not in a bad way. Perhaps a bit medicinal but also very bracing and refreshing. And then cardamom comes in and things take a sweet and spicy turn, although citrus is still in the picture. The eucalyptus turns into a deeper and smoother pine, still bracing but not as medicinal. It’s a wonderful pine, green and resinous.  Over time the wood becomes much stronger in the mix and the bracing feeling gets toned down into a smooth sweet wood with a hint of spice. It’s really lovely at this stage, and so different from its open, which is also good but in such a different way. I’m a woman that generally loves a unisex fragrance, but to my taste this is completely masculine. It’s classic but modern, and very beautiful. This is a fun experience in a fragrance, even if it doesn’t sound like your thing I recommend sampling it.', ""In the beginning, very citrusy. Not only citrus but, medicinal in a way. Non-violent. It's somber and smooth. The dry down is heavenly with a consistent incense and vetiver note. The longevity is great, becomes more of a skin scent after a few hours. Not the type of fragrance that blasts people away with projection. It's confident, but doesn't need to shout to be known as so."", 'Citrusy, piney, and fresh. Yeah, I’m digging this.', 'Weird, woody, powdery, dusty. A bit like concrete.', ""1828 is a tribute to Jules Verne, but since Beethoven died in 1828, I'll compare this beautiful perfume to a Beethoven symphony.  Exposition: one of the most beautiful grapefruit notes I have smelled in perfumery. It is so realistic, it actually transported my mind back to a time so far back in my childhood when we used to eat grapefruit (doused in sugar of course) every morning. Main Theme of citrus gives way to the secondary theme of pine and they blend for the remainder of the exposition. Development: Nutmeg joins the swirling themes from the exposition. The warm spice modulates with camphorous eucalyptus into remote keys, far removed from the opening citric harmonies. But the reminder of the citrus never fully fades- there is a sweetness emerging that is both delightful and unexpected. Recapitulation: As the composition comes to a gentle conclusion, we are left with the most beautiful sweet dry down I have come across. Do not think of designer-scent-level syrupy, overwrought sweet accords. This is subtle, gentle, and so incredibly pleasant. It must be the nutmeg and remnants of citrus with a slightly green woodiness. This is an amazing coda to a fragrance masterpiece.  A rare 10/10 for me, I would wish to change nothing about 1828. A gentlemanly perfume of the world. If I could only have one fragrance, this would be a contender! Beautiful."", 'Fougere but not a fougere. Chypre but not a chypre. Opens up fresh, a touch powdery and very green with the head of eucalyptus and citrus.The interplay of eucalyptus, pine, vetiver give off a ""typical"" barbershop smell that encompasses both fougere and chypre in my book. This is soften by warm spiciness of nutmeg and aromatic, floral touch of black pepper. Lasts pretty decent on my skin, with moderate sillage. Thoroughly enjoyed this.', ""A virile, old school fougère minus the lavender; a more palatable and more complex, citrusy version of Amouage's Bracken Man, with pine substituting cypress and some eucalyptus thrown in for good measure. Enjoying my sample and still deciding whether or not to pull the trigger on a full bottle. Edit: 03/12/24 - Okay, so several weeks of sniffing and enjoying my sample I just can't seem to splash out on a bottle. Maybe if it were half the price I would. I really like it, but I don't find it special enough to warrant the rather lofty expense. I nevertheless highly recommend sampling if you like old school. Re-edit: 05/02/24 - Really enjoying this again, and considering buying a bottle! Re-re-edit: 12/27/24 - Bought a tester and loving it! Definitely for old school enthusiasts. Regal, distinguished, great quality. Loving the eucalyptus/camphor/sweet citrus combo in the opening anchored by a subtle but formidable leather/patchouli base. Signature scent worthy!"", ""I am so mindblown by this fragrance. And I can’t for the life of me figure out why most reviewers here believe that women can’t pull it off, because to my nose and on my skin it is perfectly unisex. Histories de Parfums missed the mark deciding not to market this in their officially unisex category. (They’re rare in that they use the categories “for him”, “for her”, and “unisex”.) The citrus top doesn't feel energizing and bright as citrus tops typically do. Instead of the norm, 1828’s citrus is immediately and deeply calming, wrapped up in that soothing eucalyptus, cosy nutmeg, and smooth incense. If I could only use one word to describe 1828, that’s what it would be— smooth. It’s well blended right away. Sweetness (sap?) dancing with evergreen and camphorous aromatics, one of my favorite kinds of perfume magic. I don’t get the grapefruit, and I don’t get fresh orange juice. I get an aged orange tea, and it’s so beautiful. This is quintessentially versatile in both time of day and season. The slight sweetness and deep incense lend 1828 to day or night, winter to spring to summer to fall. As far as value? You can pick up 60mL for around $70. That’s a steal for this quality. I blind bought this, and it was a safe blind buy in my eyes. Even if it doesn’t wow you like it has me, I can’t see anyone finding this unwearable putting aside very rogue skin chemistry. Women who love unisex scents, try this. I don’t think you’ll be disappointed. And to the men— if I smelled this on a man, I’d never be able to take my face out of his neck. Sexy and cosy. Wrapped up in blankets."", ""Tame and clean smelling woody/citrus I was expecting more earthiness and smokiness reading the notes breakdown so I’m a bit disappointed.  Overall a nice scent that has a sharp freshness to it. Honestly for this type of scent profile though I’d rather go with something like Jovoy L'Art de la Guerre"", 'A Tribute to Jules Verne... The discovery set insert reads: ""In honor of the father of literary science fiction, and the ocean that inspired his extraordinary novels of adventure, an aquatic fragrance with fresh citrus notes, and an adventurous aromatic base."" I could imagine Shazad Latif wearing this as he stars as Captain Nemo in Nautilus (2023), based on Jules Verne\'s famous work, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.  I just have a sample that\'s had a chance to age, and the camphor notes are really toned down, and it\'s turned quite sweet, but still gives a citrus aromatic impression, with sweeter woody notes underneath. I don\'t get much of an aquatic vibe but the discovery set insert calls this an ""aromatic aquatic"". I\'m getting a sweeter, slightly leather-y aromatic scent. Enjoy!', ""Opens with a pine note that has a soft leathery nuance, and the mix of nutmeg and pepper make it feel like a very serious fragrance, immediately reminded me of a milder version of Russian Leather by Memo, and scents like Bottega Veneta Pour Homme (and its flankers). But as it stays on skin, a gentle sweetness comes through from the tangerine, a subtly vibrant eucalyptus notes with some soft citrus make this creamier, and blend in beautifully with the green pine note, giving this fragrance a cold character. The vetiver and a somewhat cleanly done incense stay throughout the life of the scent in the background. Overall this is a really nice mature, signature worthy scent, that's done well balancing subtlety and a sense of authoritativeness, refined with some persona. 7.5/10"", 'On paper - eucalyptus prominent on top, then citrus-rounded-vetiver. No incense at all. On my skin - much less eucalyptus (or at least it lifts off my skin very quickly). My skin turns the citruses sweet (which is fine), and interestingly enough I get the incense only on my skin. Less vetiver, though still prominent. Nice! Like a niche version of TDH. Scent: Clean, simple daily scent. Citrus-vetiver with some incense in the base. 8/10 Projection: Soft to average Longevity: Average Polarity: Unisex to masculine', 'This is a clean vetiver fragrance, not in the barbershop genre Whatsoever. Opening is uninteresting, mid is generic.  Overall this Smells mainly of clear & clean vetiver, eucalyptus, and a dash of nutmeg. You get wafts of incense in the mid.  Zero citrus. Not sweet. Minimal wood. NOT in the realm of Russian Leather at all! More like Grey Vetiver! Can be worn year round. Dries down to a smooth soapy clean lite vetiver scent that is Pleasant in the air. First 4hrs Not my cup of tea really, but as a Vetiver fragrance it’s solid, nothing groundbreaking though. The far, far dry down is great.. vetiver fades away a lot leaving The eucalyptus giving off that subtle soapy clean aroma is very calming at bed time 🤤.', 'Smells super sexy on a virile man of a certain age(35+) It\'s ""fresh-green"", woody, with some mild, natural sweetness. For me, it smells like something from Geo F Trumper: handsome, clean and sophisticated. Both longevity and projection are very good.', ""1828 smells handsome and dignified. Echoes of classic barbershop scents are evident, but there is a surprising complexity here: the bracing, almost medicinal camphor of eucalyptus leaf in the top notes, supported by citrus, gives me a rush. A pine accord that follows fuses this effect into the heart of warm, dry, yet smooth nutmeg. This is anchored by something that seems like a peppery elemi, and somewhat smoky woods. It's vivacious and winsome sensibility may not be the sort of challenge a fumehead may crave, but I love the lucid directness of 1828. There are moments that remind me of a pine forest after the rain, and that in and of itself is worth the price of admission."", 'Very mild eucalyptus mist with natural, zesty citric aromas. Stars off a bit pissy but that wears off with time. Refined and elegant. Sandalwood, vanilla, cedar, pine and nutmeg work their way into the nuance, which shines more as the base dulls and fades. Here’s where the scent gets more masculine.  VG.', 'Great slightly sweet tangerine and bright fresh grapefruit opening. But that opens up into a smoky nutmeg with citrus hiding around the edges. Pleasant to sit with. It reminds me of dry forests. Not glaring. Could easily wear this in the office without bothering people but still have something just slightly different. I don\'t get any ""powder"" since it doesn\'t have lavender or iris.', 'Update: I wore this again today after some air got in the bottle and the nutmeg is toned down (yet still evident), and I\'m getting more of the eucalyptus and woods balancing the creamy sweetness. Really enjoyed the whole experience. Still get the eggnog association due to first smelling nutmeg in eggnog as a child... 1828 completely subverted my expectations based on notes...which is often the case, and just reinforces my ""always sample if possible"" rule.  Strangely, the strongest association that came up immediately for me was, of all things...Eggnog. The creamy and nutmeg spiced holiday brew. The single most dominating note I pick up in this is spiced, sweet nutmeg, followed by some very creamy, smooth, almost milky woody type notes. You would almost think sandalwood would be a listed note, not cedar, vetiver and pine.  I do not get strong citrus as I expected (there\'s three different types listed) nor do I get much incense, or other notes popping out at me. It\'s pretty well-blended, and if it were not for the dominant nutmeg I would get more of amorphous smooth creamy blob, lacking any highs or lows. There is one note as it dries down that I perceive as a sharp texture, rather than definable note. It kind of crawls straight up my nose. Perhaps it is the pine/eucalyptus note, or more likely some unnamed aromachem. Hoping this smooths out over time. I wish this had a touch more earthiness, drier wood notes, noticeable incense, and a more prominent eucalyptus. I do think I like 1828, and am hoping with time and air my 15ml travel sprays develops or I start to pick up more of the nuances.  As is, I\'ll tuck this away as a perfect daytime holiday fragrance. Just a bit too creamy, sweet, and smooth for me to use as a daily driver or summertime fragrance.', ""Testing blind, this opened with a fresh and green feeling that lasted about 30-40 minutes, after which it becomes warmer with a hint of smokeniess, and has a familiar vetiver feel. It also reduced to an intimate skin scent within an hour, and although it hung out for a while I'd argue it is difficult to give it a longevity longer than eight hours realistically. Looking at the notes now, I don't feel some are noticable. While some citrus and herbs add to the fresh green feeling at the opening it dries down as mainly the clear vetiver leaning a bit cleaner and green. I can't really notice anything of incense or nutmeg, and it's not nearly as citrus as the number of citrus notes listed suggests. It leans fresh but not really citrus at all, more clean and fresh intimate vetiver after 30-40 minutes. Nice and pleasant but more projection I would desire. Few more wearings after getting another sample. Opening still green but noticing a distinct citrus front with a hint of spice than before."", 'Very nice frag.

Will always have a bottle of this around!"", ""I really like this one. I've been trying to find some fragrances that are appropriate for the warmer months and daytime wear, and this is a lovely option. The nutmeg keeps the woodiness a little sweet and light as the citrus fades while avoiding the creaminess some woody scents can reach that I enjoy smelling but not wearing. It feels both classic and playful to me. Definitely skews a bit masculine due being at least fougère adjacent (and I suspect the house agrees with me, since it's under their For Him section) but is unisex enough that I think anyone who's fond of the notes could enjoy it.  I don't know if I quite like it enough to get a full bottle or keep it in my collection long term, but I look forward to using the rest of the generous decant of it I have on hand to get a proper feel for it.

It\'s like little pellets of different smelling substances all grayish blue, green and turquoise shades. 3rd wear: Yeah, I like it. The eucalyptus is the clou here for me. It stays there for the whole duration and has a quite a unique ""blunt vegetal freshness"". 1828 might not be a huge compliment magnet, but won\'t offend anyone either, and you certainly won\'t smell like average cologne guys. Rounded up to Like because of the uniqueness.', ""I didn't realise this scent was for men when I tried it. Comes on with a strong masculine cologne but quickly lifts. This smells like 'pirate' to me - fresh sea air, rich wood, a touch of sharp green and something smoky. Quite creamy and yet invigorating.

It\'s has to be that eucalyptus note, it sticks out through the entire fragrance profile for all 7+ hours. I hadn\'t smell Terre\'d Hermes, but when I finally did 1828 was an almost perfect match if not superior in all facets. If you read the description of the fragrance on their website it details this as ""smelling like a chest made of high quality woods full of spices from across the seas."" I couldn\'t have said it better myself. I didn\'t like it at first, but it\'s now my signature scent and I\'m very glad I picked up the biggest bottle. 10/10 fragrance.', 'This fragrance was originally named ""1828-Jules Verne"" when HdP premiered it: they originally called their perfumes after famous people and the year they were born, but later dropped the names and just left the years, so now it is just ""1828."" This is confusing, since HdP also carries a fragrance similarly called ""1826,"" which was originally also named after Empress Eugenie and is quite feminine in its notes. So make sure you know which one you\'re getting if you buy this or order a sample. The idea behind naming it after Jules Verne is that it\'s evocative of the fresh fields and pastures new celebrated in his adventure stories, particularly ""Around the World in 80 Days."" This opens with all kinds of different citrus (mostly grapefruit) that is backed up by woods and vetiver, and with nutmeg done absolutely right at the heart of it. It\'s not a fougére, but it\'s quite fresh. This would make an absolutely perfect office fragrance because it smells so clean and open. It has average projection, but it lasts a long time.', 'This smells vintage and modern at the same time. A nice woody/spicy scent with fresh citrus undertone. I like this one.', ""Simply put, if you like barbershop or woody fragrances you'll like this because it blends those two genres. I find it absolutely addictive.

It does have a vintage feel, but not super dated. The opening is really well done with citruses and eucalyptus which is not too camphoric, t's perfectly balanced. The drydown is where this really shines. Creamy cedarwood with a bit of spice, pine cade, a transparent incense, and a touch of turpenes. This has been my signature scent lately, and I have a hell of lot of cologne. I even keep a bottle in my office. Leans heavily masculine imo. If you like Creed Spice and Wood, get this.  Scent 10/10 Performance 5/10"", ""I found this one to be a surprise in timing, a play with a pleasant but interminable first act, where following intermission the second serves only to trail off with an ellipsis. It begins with a huge orangey citrus, like satsuma aromatherapy oil. Blended in are green notes with a firm and undefined base. Here it reminds me strongly of the opening of D&G The One, but where that will move on to the warmth of tobacco and amber, this is more austere, and anyhow it's not even remotely finished with the opening. The citruses linger in all their richness for nearly a full 45 minutes, a triumph on its own, and then the lemon top end of nutmeg threads the needle to a more old school drydown, herbaceous with an undercurrent of vetiver and just a wisp of incense. I thought the greenery was thyme at first, but as things cleared up in the drydown it became apparent that that was the eucalyptus, lingering for the length of the composition, from first adding counterpoint to the citrus it finally gets a few lines of its own. A bit of an anticlimax of a drydown all things considered, but graceful. Competent and interesting, even if not something quite as spectacular as a 1740. Gosh, I love this house."", ""I absolutely adore this scent! I lean towards fresh, lean fragrances as I live in a very warm climate, and find this to be perfectly unisex and not at all generic men's cologne as some other reviewers have flagged.

This does start out as a soapy citrus and vetiver, and there's something that is a bit distinct, which I'm assuming is the eucalyptus. Then a slightly sweet orange comes in along with the nutmeg and this soooo good! it has a bit of an old-school men's fragrance vibe, which I really love. I actually think it's quite sexy. The dry down to my nose is incense/resins, spices and some woods. I would say this is unisex leaning masculine. I'm a female and I would wear this, and I'd also really enjoy smelling it on a man."", 'This is a very nice unisex fragrance. Opens with airy eucalyptus.

A creamy oily fragrance that becomes a bit powdery in drydown. Its a good versatile and well crafted fragrance', 'so fantastic! original, unique, high quality', ""Unfortunately, all I get from it is a flashback to my dad's Gillette shaving gel from the 90s"", 'I’m really surprised by the notes on this one. To me it doesn’t smell like a fresh cologne like others have described. I don’t know many perfumes with pine and eucalyptus in but this isn’t what I imagined those notes to smell like. I feel like the nutmeg is strongest for me if anything. To me this smells warm. Fantastic scent for day, night, office, date. Quite addictive to keep sniffing.', 'What a beautiful fresh clean masculine frag that doesn’t smell old man. I’m so thankful for that. 1828 has quickly risen to become one of my signature scents. I wear it more in the warmer weather, but still roll with it year round. This is like a combination of your favorite barbershop and favorite fresh clean fragrance.  9.5/10', ""I don't know why I was shocked that this smelled like generic cologne, but it really does. That being said, I think that if you're looking for a really clean, fresh masculine scent that's *just* a bit more refined than most designer fragrances, this could be a good pick. Smelling this blindly without paying attention to the label, I actually initially thought that it was intended to be a women's perfume- I think it's something about the brightness of the top notes that makes it feel unisex to me, although I'm not usually a big believer in categorizing fragrances by gender in general. Overall, this is really nice, but not super unique, and I feel like you could get something similar at a cheaper price point if all you were going for was a classic cologne scent."", ""A fresh, old-school cologne with some surprising undertones I don't find listed here. Apart from the woods and citrusses (which are not very prominent on my skin) I get hazelnut a few minutes after the initial spray, and then something very creamy in the drydown, almost milky.

Eucalyptus, grapefruit, pepper, vetiver and cloves with the first three prominent and tangerine waving its hand occasionally. The initial fresh blast settles to clean and cool slightly peppery.

I completely agree, it opens nice but it dries down into generic cologne smell so it\'s a little boring imho. Edit: I will add a touch extra info after seeing other reviews. Testing side by side with Aventus I see what someone else means about this being a fougere take on it. There are definite overlaps with the fresher aspects of Aventus here, not the smokiness and fruity opening of it, although the pepper note in 1828 hints at a smokiness too. Aventus is more interesting though overall and I’ll stick with my assessment of 1828 drying down a little dull for my tastes.', ""1828 is fresh, clean, and masculine.

You get the citrus and the eucalyptus as well as the pepper. It is a bit soapy, think aromatic fougere, but it is much brighter and has some more depth. This fragrance dries down in stages. Once the opening softens it is clean, fresh, citrusy, but you can start to smell the woods. Once it finally dries down, you can smell the nutmeg and the pine. The whole time it is underscored by incense. This is a highly versatile fragrance that I think can be worn year round. I think it can work well in the winter months in warmer climates. The citrus and the pine invoke images of driving up California's coast, where tall,green trees meet the ocean. This is really a fantastic fragrance."", ""At first spray, Histoires de Parfums' 1828 starts with a joyful and refreshing eucalyptus leaf, resembling a menthol note instead of a sauna like smell. For the first 10 to 15 minutes, a tangerine smell mixes itself with the eucalyptus, creating a crisp and manly atmosphere perfect for the spring season. The tangerine note disappears quickly, letting the middle and base notes take center stage. 1828 changes to the base notes quite quickly. It stays herbal throughout the base stage with its pine and nutmeg notes, similar to how a forest in Oregon would smell like. Silliage is good, and longevity is about 6 hours on my skin. However, and although I appreciate how unique, masculine, and fresh this fragrance is, I feel like the nutmeg and the eucalyptus stay too constant and for far too long in the fragrance's life cycle, providing a minty mouth wash/shaving cream smell to it. To me, this smell gets exasperating after awhile. If you like mint notes, 1828 is for you. Dislike."", ""After collecting for over 40 years and having owned close to 140 fragrances (and sampling many more), I have finally found my olfactory soul mate.  Aventus may still be the King of Kings but, at first sniff, this one struck a deep personal accord with me. The grapefruit and citruses hit you right away followed by a strange but intriguing combination of nutmeg and pine. Then something strange happens after an hour: It all disappears....or so you think.  Throughout the day you get a whiff here and a whiff there; not overpowering but enough to get your attention. Then, unexplainably, it makes a comeback. You begin to radiate a combo of vetiver and incense which stays with you until you go to bed and still lingers a bit when you wake up the next day.

Luckily that only lasts 5-10 minutes and then it is heaven.  Opening reminds me of Terre'd Hermes a lot which I don't like, and drydown when citruses faded a bit reminds me of Azzaro Visit and Penhaligon's Halfeti.

The eucalyptus also gives 1828 an aquatic feel but it remains completely natural, unlike most aquatic fragrances. Agree with a previous commenter that this is a pretty masculine frag but I'm enjoying it nonetheless. This would be a great choice you're looking for a well made cologne for a man who may be adventurous in general but not when it comes to fragrances. Sophisticated but confident and upbeat."", ""I received the Histoires de Parfums sample book, and this is my favorite of them all!

Given its hefty price tag, it\'s not much bang for the buck. This smells eeriely like a toned down, less cheery, more mature and sombre version of Minotaure with much less sillage and longevity. In fact, this would have been the perfect Minotaure ""summer edition"" or ""eau de cologne"". The great thing is, you can buy Minotaure anywhere online for about a quarter of the price!  I strongly recommend starting off with a 2ml sample or a 14ml travel size (both available from the official HdP website) before committing to a full bottle.', 'a woody-balmy sophisticated scent that is for sure. the freshness is not that citric as one would aspect when you see the high core of citric ingredients. Grapefruit and Tangerine are more bitter a note you can discern right from the start with the pine.

It ends in an aromatic incense-vetiver-wood combination that is very balanced. A nice perfume for a official occasion.', ""I'm going to describe this scent by the style of the wearer. If Buddy Holly came back from the past and lived today, this would be his scent. A young sophisticated guy with intellect beyond his years. A book smart type with style, someone who looks good wearing glasses, someone who seems to make a statement everywhere he goes, not necessarily with words but with his presences and if with words, words of advice, words of wisdom.  If I was a time traveler, I'd wear this. If I could step into that Delorean and go anywhere, past, present or future this would be in my shaving kit. When I smell 1828, I think.....the old is back in. It exemplifies a fashionable guy who knows how to dress and stay ahead of new trends. Better yet, he’s a trend setter.  Right from the start you get the citrus orange and grapefruit and pine. The bitterness of the grapefruit smoothly compliments the pine as they seem to go very well together which balances it out. There is almost a coolness that comes into play which is the eucalyptus. The pepper spices it up and the nutmeg sweetens its dry down. You're left leaving a great impression. I don't think this scent is for everyone but it will intrigue the people around you to want to know what it is.  My advice to the wearer is - Trendy, sophisticated fashionable guy can wear this year round. This could be an all-day scent.

However, 1828 somehow manages to smell modern in spite of these associations, perhaps because it\'s a bit lighter and livelier, with upbeat citrus notes and well-balanced woods. I wouldn\'t mind owning this, and maybe when my bottle of Lorenzo Villoresi\'s excellent, ""Uomo"" runs out, I\'ll give it a shot, but for now, I\'ll just be happy to know that it\'s out there. 1828 is a solid offering from HdP and certainly worth considering if you\'re looking for something in this vein. It doesn\'t present any new concepts, but it executes an old one very well. Projection and longevity are good.', 'I have great respect for HdP and love several of their fragrances (1725, 1740, 1899 and 1969). But here I pass.

Mostly I\'ve been reconnecting with scents reviewed by me long ago. Not so with 1828 Jules Verne from Histoires de Parfums. Somehow I neglected to weigh in on this one. I wonder why? Perhaps because 1828 is such a stereotypical masculine cologne! This is one of those creations which makes it difficult to maintain the ""all perfumes are unisex"" thesis with a straight face. No, my fragrant friends, this is an aromatic citrus ""guy in a blue banker suit"" cologne! It smells pretty good for what it is, but it\'s definitely not for me. I do like the juxtaposition of the spices (especially nutmeg) in here, but overall it\'s just too masculine for me.  Seems like a safe choice for guys who are not really into perfume (as in: who don\'t wear Angel and Aromatics Elixir).', 'The quality of the ingredients is undeniable, but they add up to less than the sum of their parts. In the opening, the citrus and cypress are fairly vibrant and create an outdoorsy, fresh impression. Unfortunately, after about an hour they flatten into an overly sweet (for me anyway, but I have a low tolerance for sweetness in scents), ""generic"" smell that reminds me of too many fragrances in the ""fresh"" category, as opposed to those that actually smell fresh. It\'s not bad, just mediocre. The combination of longevity and linearity ended up making me simply tired of the scent by the end of the day.', 'In 1828 I am standing on a sandy beach with a pine forest behind my back, looking at the open see.

This is a spring scent - cannot agree more with Kain. A masterly executed blend of freshness, sweetness and spice - very easy-going and relaxing, but by no means ""simplistic"".

As time goes by I'm picking  up a mixture of the pine and grapefruit notes with eucalyptus in the background. The menthol aspect and pine together with woods coming into play with incense make this fragrance interesting.  Though to be honest these fragrance accords are not to my taste though this would be worth sampling if you like these notes in a scent. Again everything is so well blended and the ingredients are top notch. So to sum up a dry pine menthol fragrance with incense and woods which smells good and different from a lot of fragrances on the shelves.

It opens with citruses and eucalyptus immediately joined by incense. Frankincense perfectly blends with the aromatic grapefruit note adding depth and consistency to the fragrance. This accord is definitely successful and so well executed that I was ready to declare 1828 as one of my favourite compositions from this house. Elegant, masculine, fresh but not dull, with a remarkable presence but not loud...a fantastic everyday\'s fragrance...but... ...but disappointment was waiting for me just right behind the corner. The eucalyptus note evaporates in couple of minutes and you can say goodbye to the ""balsamic"" effect. Same is for the aromatic grapefruit leaving 1828 in a sort of generic territory made of vetiver, spices and woods (mainly cedar) that\'s really too similar to Gucci Envy For Men. Overall I can\'t say that 1828 is unsuccessful but after the outstanding opening I definitely expected something more. That said, if you\'re not familiar with Gucci Envy For Men and you are ready for a challenging price tag, you could enjoy 1828. Personally I stick with the Gucci.

And it fits the bill perfectly. It\'s fresh, but with a heart of subtle spice. It\'s an aromatic hesperidic scent, with Grapefruit shinning centre stage. With Top notes of Grapefruit, Italian Orange, Mandarine and Eucalyptus. Heart notes of Nutmeg and Black Pepper. And Base notes of Atlas Ceder, Patchouli, Siberian Pine Cone, Vetiver and Incense.

Aventus may still be the King of Kings but, at first sniff, this one struck a deep personal accord with me.

Then something strange happens after an hour: It all disappears....or so you think.  Throughout the day you get a whiff here and a whiff there; not overpowering but enough to get your attention. Then, unexplainably, it makes a comeback. You begin to radiate a combo of vetiver and incense which stays with you until you go to bed and still lingers a bit when you wake up the next day.

The tangerine note disappears quickly, letting the middle and base notes take center stage. 1828 changes to the base notes quite quickly. It stays herbal throughout the base stage with its pine and nutmeg notes, similar to how a forest in Oregon would smell like. Silliage is good, and longevity is about 6 hours on my skin. However, and although I appreciate how unique, masculine, and fresh this fragrance is, I feel like the nutmeg and the eucalyptus stay too constant and for far too long in the fragrance's life cycle, providing a minty mouth wash/shaving cream smell to it.

This has a unique smell that is refreshing when it seems most designers are all copying each other. I like it, I just wish it performed better. Ill give it some more wearings and if things change, I will edit this review.', 'Does this come in a eau de parfum or parfum version please? I prefer more intensity', ""Back in 2004/5 I used to love this. I wanted to transport myself back to those days so I ordered a bottle, I was sorely disappointed. This has changed a lot since the early days, a shadow of its former self. Very weak, theres a sickly plastic smell in there too. Definitely reformulated. I'll let the bottle sit for a few weeks and come back to it, hopefully it just needs some maceration time. I doubt it though.  (Edit: I had to wash this off, it made me feel sick to my stomach, and if I think about it I start to feel nauseous, I’ll be sending this back I think)"", 'Not one I reach for often but I adore this scent. It doesn’t last through physical activity or heat very well and it isn’t a huge projector but man is this stuff beautiful juice for just lounging around the house or chilling outside. It’s very unique and addictive to smell. Develops quite a bit on my skin which I spoke about in my first review of this stuff. Nice for after a shower going to bed, it’s therapeutic to me!', ""I remember I was coming back from the Philippines; for some reason I had it in my head that I had to spend some of my 'Holiday Money' before I came back to the UK; I had overthought so many purchases that holiday and said 'no' so many times when I should've just said 'yeah why not you only live twice'... Wish I had said no to this; its typically Paco, sweet, super sweet.. well typically Paco... just something about the whole Paco Rabanne range that makes me think that it worn by guys who stuff their 'spare' socks down their trousers.. I really cannot tell you what I did with this but don't have it anymore. ..still got those socks though. 4/10 - I won't be returning"", ""If you told me this were a Pierre Bourdon job for Creed I wouldn't argue with you one bit. Has the same laundry ambergris opening as GIT, MI, and such, with a spearmint gum quality in the vein of Invictus (which, let's be honest, had kind of the same general vibe as MI going on). There's a lot more vetiver in this too than the votes would have you believe.  The heart comes with a floral aspect, thanks to lyral and geraniol and the drydown is a woody, musky, vanilla thing. The mint and ambergris never really go away though and the overall effect is rather linear. Not a bad thing at all, it's a very interesting and (likely for many) perplexing scent. It fits right into the mold of turn of the millennium fashion.  It might take a little time to wrap your head around and it won't be the perfect choice for every occasion, but we're talking about an era where a lot of perfumes took risks and tried weird things. Synthetic? You bet. So was everything from that general time period. You want natural vibes, go seek ye out some pre-80's masculines. They're as natural as they come but so few these days clamor for them. This was the start of Y2K, baby. Let's get weird with it."", ""I remember trying this while on a testing rampage in a department store. It was the first and so far only time a scent made me go: I know this, I love this, I want this, all in a matter of minutes. Still not sure why I recognized it, my best guess is a certain family member may have worn it for a while when it was new. It came after a phase where I was sometimes going for manly and bad-ass, trying some really retro scents, and this put me back on the track of just wearing what I like best and what smells plain nice to me regardless of the image it's putting across. I used to get lots of vanilla here, but more recently the same bottle smells fresher and greener to me, arguably more like the note breakdown here on Fragrantica. No idea if it's my nose or the liquid that's aging, or alternatively my reference points changing as I experience more fragrances."", ""It's pretty good, but it IS super sweet. And perhaps a bit synthetic, although I'm not sure if that word really means anything anymore. One reviewer I saw on YouTube disliked it, because he said it reminded him of melted chocolate mint ice cream. And now that's the only thing I can think of when I smell it.  Not sure if that's good or bad...."", ""It's synthetic but very underwhelming. A cheaper and perhaps better alternative is hannae more HM the transparent bottle. This is such a let down and is overhyped. I have ultrared on the way hopefully not a let down."", 'Ultra synthetic haha but it’s a good scent nonetheless. If you like vanilla/ambery scents on the dry down this is for you!!', 'Gladly received this as a valentines day gift <3 Have been wearing it all week to work and have been enjoying it more and more every day as I learn about it in real-time. First thing that you will notice is (obviously) the box, a really cool and slick, shiny violet coloured box with an icy white/silver strip around the ""ultraviolet"" keeping things simple, futuristic and memorable! As soon as you open the box and see the bottle is a wow moment for me, I know this product is quite old yet it is probably the most innovative and original bottle in my whole collection. A long, vertical, purple trigger which works really well and is super unique to use. Lightly coloured lilac juice inside a transparent bottle.  Finally, and most importantly, the smell. The opening makes me think of the sweets known as floral gum/cherry lips and also freshly cut flowers. A sweet , sugary , almost perfume scent at first. As it begins to dry down it becomes a smoother and creamier vanilla scent. Not a beast in terms of projection but perfect for office/daily wear without annoying anyone. Pulls in compliments , and is enjoyable to smell of yourself as the day goes on.  Delighted to have this one in my arsenal.  Not to sound disrespectful to this fragrance, but is great for freshening a room also, as I have the 100ml bottle I have been spraying generously.', 'What a unique PR fragrance this one is. Designed by one of my favorite perfumers, Jacques Cavallier. And what I experience is totally subjective and different if I compare the notes mentioned above and in the reviews below with my own perception. For me Ultra Violet opens tame with a soft amber, spices and a woody vetiver. And the magic happens for me in the drydown. I smell a lovely fresh citrus with white flowers. A bit like Cologne by Dior. It’s very elegant and uplifting and mostly it is the other way around with the pattern of fresh fragrances. They start fresh and end musky, sweet or ambery. On paper it lasts a long time. On my skin the smell disappears rather quickly. So the performance is not very good. And that’s the only thing that withholds me from purchasing a full bottle of this lovely subtle synthetic but natural smelling pleaser. Edit: 3-3-22. I pulled the trigger for a 100 ml bottle. It’s one of the most peculiar frags that I own. Like a chameleon it has different patterns and experiences, from fresh to dusty sweet, spicy and sometimes I smell a synthetic powdery lavender. It changes constantly, very weird. I wonder how Ultra Violet behaves in warmer weather.', ""Pretty good fragrance, kind of reminds me of Creed's GIT in a way. Obviously it has differences in terms of quality and the overall smell, but it puts me in the same mood as GIT. Opens very green and very fresh, with a slight sweetness (but nowhere near the usual sweetness you'd expect from a PR men's fragrance). To my nose it's a pretty linear scent, as it dries down maybe I get a bit of vanilla but that's pretty much it.  This isn't a panty-dropper type of fragrance where women are going to be head over heels over the way you smell. It's pretty unique and very fresh but not sexy by any means. It's also quite synthetic and very obviously a 'perfume', as in concocted in a lab somewhere, but it's really well done so it doesn't bother me too much.  Performance is just 'meh'. Projection is okay for about an hour than gets more intimate, longevity about 4-5 hours.  Overall a solid 7.5/10. Worth a try, it's not bad by any means."", 'Unique and versatile, metallicy, earthy, wet-mossy, lively amber accords that smell innovative, fresh and quite modern. This frag is definitely worth the purchase, as the experience is indeed quite unique, with massive overall pleasantness. I can tell you to Buy Blind with confidence, as you\'ll be mesmerized by the modern opening, an ambiance of its swirls and wafts of fruity, metallic, deep earthy notes. The dry-down takes a while but remains pretty much the same, with those rich accords of moss, amber and earth filling your sillage bubble. Performance is moderate-plus as is projection, longevity and sillage, possible lasting longer in winter. It is an Eau de Toilette (cologne) strength and is fairly potent this way. An EDP would be overpowering, so EDT suits this frag. The bottle is worth a mention, with its long side-press button, its works okay but I\'d prefer a more traditional style. Overall, Ultraviolet Paco Rabanne for Men is a ""Don\'t Miss Out"" at a good price. So, smell unique for a bit.', 'Too many memories❤ very unique long-lasting fragrance. Unlike anything else. Ultraviolet the original is a safe buy ..blind buy safe.. enjoyed it a long time ago👌💜 Update: more suitable for young men 25 and less', ""PR Ultraviolet is a pleasant fragrance, not an aquatic but a fresh and sweet. PR Red is even sweeter and performance wise they are about equal. Spray on a little on your clothes and you'll get more milage with longevity & Silage. It's delightful to have these two in my collection but I wouldn't use either as a signiture scent because they lean towards femme and gets to a little much! Ultraviolet 7.5 & Red 8.0🤗❤️👍❗"", 'Blind buy for me and my initial impressions are nothing but positive! Complex and distinctive notes, gorgeous and futuristic packaging/ atomizer that match the unique scent, and just straight up addicting the more I wear it. Not to mention the great price for what you get. Signature scent worthy in my opinion. I get the comments relating this to an unopened pack of menthols but it’s in the best way possible!  Opens up a bit synthetic with a grassy, dusty, minty entrance that quickly turns smoky and peppery for me. It might be harsh at first for some of you folks but give it time to settle in cause this is where it gets addicting: The dry down steals the show for me! Here’s where it gets complex and very rich with the fresh spicy opening & heart notes phasing into a earthy, spicy vanilla that perfectly blends all the notes that have developed into a climax well worth the journey.  Not a great projector or performer, definitely more intimate. But the beauty of this one lies in the quiet, quirky, and layered development! Great addition to any collection but it’s a more mature scent at least 20s and up.', 'Vintage 2002 purple bottle vs. new 2020 clear glass bottle: No difference.  The vintage was made in France, the new is made in Spain.  Both have that fresh and slightly smoky character.  Sour berries, metallic lavender and a little bit of mint.  The whole fragrance concept is futuristic. It’s not the purple smell when you think of plum, it’s more a dark berry metallic fresh smell. Similar to Bond No. 9 Bleecker Street, which is a blueberry fragrance.', ""I think my view of Ultraviolet echoes that of many others. This fragrance is actually really pleasant. It's fairly unique, but also mass appealing- kind of what the house of Creed do (niche but more accessible fragrances). Ultraviolet feels like it has the ambergris vibes of Creed and the bubblegum of Paco Rabanne. It's slightly unique, but also mass appealing too. Unfortunately, the batch I have is weak which also makes it less desirable to use. So all in all, it's lovely but just not a wow and also lacks performance."", ""It is a nice scent, Elegant, Warm, Vanilla and Sweet. A bit synthetic, but it smells so good with reasonable price. Paco Rabanne launched it in 2001 before Bleecker Street and Purple Label. It opens up with like sweet fresh spicy and green notes in the background then dry down is sweet vanilla ambery. The art of bottle design is very unique. This is suitable for the spring , fall and winter. I like Ultraviolet Man EDT by Paco Rabanne. I'm so happy that I have it in my collection.  Rating : 7 / 10"", 'I’m pretty sure there actually are more recently produced batches of these fragrances. Widely available in Europe as well. I also have a newer Ultrared (packaging looks newer too) and I agree the performance is not good. People around me have agreed too.

Another two victims of idiotic reformulations."", ""#FirstImpression #FirstSniff: this fragrance has one of the coolest packaging - very sci-fi modern. It is an OG as it has been around the block for a bit over 2 decades. However, the scent is very relevant today. It is testament to the Paco Rabanne brand when it comes fragrances - they don't disappoint.  I get the fresh and minty top note. The spicy middle notes and vanilla also come through after a while, along with the hint of wood... it must be the vetiver.  Like 1 Million, I would say that this fragrance has a youth vibe; generally guys in their 20s and 30s can safely wear it. Ultraviolet Man is safe enough to wear in any season, to any place and occasion and at any time of day. Like 212 Man by Carolina Herera, this fragrance is a safe go to fragrance.  The scent bubble is okay - nothing extraordinary. The longevity is moderate.  I want to wear this fragrance for a while longer, before giving it a rating"", 'Unfortunately, another victim of cruel reformulations. I started my fragrance journey with this fragrance, in 2002.

I found an old 2002 version, with transparent rubber siliconic ""trigger"" and it is years ahead distance from the current versions.

It fades away quickly and tends to become forgettable."", ""Can smell the mint and amber, last a few hours, however doesn't give me the hype, only amber, spicy oakmoss"", ""Well, well, well...what can I say about this fragrance? First of all, it's my second bottle, by that I mean it's one of my favorite fragrances by Paco Rabanne, if not, THE first Paco Rabanne fragrance I ever owned and the first bottle I had, was back in early 2000's, while in high school. So, with that said, if this perfume got reformulated, I really can't tell the difference. It smells the same fresh synthetic scent of amber and mint and other green aromas, just like back in 2000's. It has the same longevity (9 to10 hours on my skin) and saddly Paco Rabanne didn't tweeked much the projection, so people won't notice much, unless they're in close range with you. Basically, it's one of those fragrances you want to wear when you're one of those weekend escapades at the ocean, during spring/summer with your loved one or use it for evening events in house of friends. Also I'd like to add that I really enjoy the bottle, I get the idea of reseambling a UV lamp, but when it comes to applying the perfume, makes me remind of those sci-fi pneumatic syringes from total recall. Jokes aside, In my opinion, I find the bottle with the most handy atomizer of all the bottles I own."", ""Such a great fragrance, under the radar. Great Mint and Ambar opening, fresh with a soft touch sweet, spice and wood. Even this is a synthetic smell, it smell gorgeous. The best of Paco Rabanne in my opinion. Not so comercial, too sweet and bubblegum smell as the most famous of this brand. Great Fragrance for spring days, for any occasion. I'd like it has more sillage, but 6-7hrs it is good.

It fits somewhere in between Joop Homme and 1 Million -- NOT because they smell similar, but because it carries the same fun, ""playboy"" type of vibe while being wedged in between those two eras. I wouldn\'t consider Ultraviolet a beast, but the club/bar is definitely the place to be wearing it. I don\'t often use the term ""synthetic"" to describe fragrances, but it is unavoidable here.

I can't believe this is not getting more love. The ingredients are so well blended and the balance is just right. I smell some florals along with some citrus in the opening. Don't be concerned about the mint as you won't recall toothpaste or menthol here. Ultraviolet fades into a musky, vanilla aura with a subtle trail of oakmoss and tobacco. The ambergris in here is very realistic - not so much a crisp/marine Creed ambergris, but more sweet/musky with a hint of tobacco. This is sophisticated, unique and very affordable."", 'Total blind buy for me. Absolutely love it!! Pure beast mode on me and it just lasts forever.

This is a male scent (the mint is the note that points it out) but it smells lovely on my skin: sweeter and not so minty, more amber and vanilla and in the drydown mixed spices. Lovely!

The composition as a whole feels kind of flat, and the synthetics here are scratchy and seem to lack polish and finesse--they feel rough on the nose and don't have a pleasing odor. I get a lot of mint and a sweet amber vanilla for most of its duration, and then some green kind of oakmoss smell in the base. But it's harsh and lacks definition or any kind of clear intent. I have a feeling this one fell victim to a poor reformulation. I really wanted to like Ultraviolet--as mint is my favorite note in perfume, and I'm a big fan of Paco Rabanne and the really cool bottle this juice is housed in--but unfortunately it just didn't work out.

Totally agree with @LaBagueette below, word for word and many others below who pointed out the loss of the original ginger/sandalwood core DNA. The Bvlgari BLV PH (at least until 2015 or so) was an absolute beauty !! Very unique. I should also join others in saying the original formulation of BLV was one of the best fragrances from Alberto Morillas. Now I can\'t detect any ginger in it. Very less of sandalwood too, both of which were the very foundation of the original. Newer versions are very powdery and extremely similar to the ""Burberry Touch"" which i dislike due to its ""Nycil"" prickly heat powder smell.

Bvlgari obviously had a different idea of what colour 'blue' smells like. It's not the Vicks Vapour rub camphor type smell that is usually associated with this colour. BLV is a delicate and soft smell - almost like baby shampoo. Unlike most fragrances, it doesn't use citrus for freshness, rather - it uses ginger, but retains no spiciness - the base is like baby powder, the sum total effect is very simple and clean.

Great value for money! Overall: 8.5/10', 'Similar drydown to Bvlgari soir', 'The best clean fragrance. It is very potent and strong. I sometimes use it in my home and one spritz in a room is immediately felt throughout the place. So refreshing, very unique, one of the best fragrances there is. It makes you feel so good. I love niche perfume and this designer perfume is in my opinion one of the best creations. The old Bvlgari perfumes are all exquisite.', 'Bvlgari BLV has been my signature scent for quite some time. I adore this fragrance. To me it is the quintessential clean fragrance. Its fresh, soapy, a tad sweet, and powdery. If you\'re looking for an everyday signature scent, look no further. Woman find this scent appealing, no question. If you\'re a young lad in school, this is the perfect choice. You will not offend anyone and MOST importantly, will not smell like a ""try hard"". This is my signature and will continue to be until I find another fragrance this pleasing. Performance could be better but that\'s a minor gripe. This one will always be in my top 3 of all time.  Performance and longevity are moderate. Sillage is moderate.', ""A great out of the shower or everyday fragrance. I used to wear this back in 2001 and I was 21 then. I'm 40 now and bought a new bottle. Still smells the same as I remember. I really enjoy the clean freshness. It's not nearly as powdery as most people say."", 'Recently bought it. Its nice soft, baby powder like smell. It is kind of cozy as well. The projection is low but considering the scent profile, it should be low. I dont know why people are complaining about its longevity. I live in a region where temperature on an average remains near 35 deg. Celcius with high humidity. I find it very long lasting. it stays with me for over 8 hrs. You can feel the scent bubble around you for long. A good office scent, i believe.', 'Bvlgari Blv Pour Homme Cologne opens with a soft projection of sweet, spicy, woody, green, and floral notes. The opening is soft, the notes are dull and most of them come up with equal intensity. The sandalwood is noticeable just as a sweet opening note; the cardamom, ginger, and tobacco blossom are the next prominent notes, a mix of a spicy and white floral accord, sharp, fresh, slightly bitter. The teak wood, juniper, and green leaves add also some touches. Bvlgari Blv is an interesting fragrance, all notes come up as featured notes, the fragrance projects equally, however, they are dull, as opposed to crisp and easily recognizable. Once Bvlgari Blv Pour Homme Cologne Men EDT has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a soft projection, slightly sweet, spicy, woody, green, and white floral fragrance. The fragrance feels faint, fresh, gentle, green, moderate-quality, modern, resinous, sweet, unisex, versatile, weak, woody, and pleasant. BATCH REVIEWED: 2020. WOW RATING: 5/10. An unimpressive, average, but pleasant fragrance floral (tobacco blossom), spicy, woody, and fresh green notes. DISLIKE RATING: 0/10. The fragrance contains no offensive notes. UNIQUENESS: 6/10. Common notes, but relatively average scent. MASS APPEAL: 6/10. Most people will find this fragrance OK but not great. PROJECTION: 3/10. Moderate to low, about 3 feet, it feels soft. SILLAGE: 3/10. Moderate to low, 3 or fewer feet, about arm’s length. APPLICATION: 6 atomizations. LONGEVITY: 3/10. Low, about 3 hours, it projects for less than 1 hour. SEASONS: Spring, summer. OCCASIONS: Formal events, outdoor gatherings, office, business, casual, holidays, vacations. This is an office-friendly fragrance.  VERSATILITY: 5/10. A soft fragrance, and better suited for mild or warm weather but not sports. GENDER: Unisex, the slight green note creates a masculine touch but the white floral accord creates a feminine touch. AGES: Any. RECOMMENDATION: Bvlgari Blv Pour Homme Cologne Men EDT can be purchased for about $50, it is a pleasant fragrance blending multiples notes into a fresh and casual scent but its projection and longevity are very poor. It is a nice-to-have, but not a must-have. BLIND-BUY: Yes, but only if you are familiar with its main notes. Also, consider its poor performance. SIMILAR: These are examples of green fragrances. Alfred Dunhill Pursuit Men EDT is a green note and woody cedar and spicy fragrance; Costume National Cyber Garden is a soft green, and woody fragrance, poor performance; Jacques Bogart Story Green is an affordable green and woody fragrance. SUMMARY: A soft projection, slightly sweet, spicy, woody, green, and white floral fragrance. The fragrance feels faint, fresh, gentle, green, moderate-quality, modern, resinous, sweet, unisex, versatile, weak, woody, and pleasant.', 'One of the best and safest perfumes to wear, for all seasons, day and night, any occasion except partying and clubbing and wedding..', 'I had a large bottle of this when it was new, I was never convinced, it was very generic and even unisex', 'Plain, simple, good.', 'I get the similarities with Prada Amber. This is a lemon luxury soap. Feels like it will be a skin scent but has really great performance. Very deceptive. This performs better than the Prada and smells just as good. 9/10 The performance on this makes it special and my Prada Amber obsolete.', ""When I first tried this years ago, I thought it was just another boring fresh scent that didn't interest me in the slightest. Gave it to a friend without thinking twice. Ran into it again at Stein mart and decided to give it another chance. Definitely smells better than I remember and does have something that makes it stand out a little more from the rest of the other standard men's aquatic scents, probably the ginger. Unfortunately it just doesn't last long at all. It's a shame because it is a pleasant scent but I don't think I'll be keeping it around or just carry it around to reapply all day."", 'I was surprised on first sniff. Soapy, powdery fragrance. Baby powder is a close representation. Not at all blue as I was expecting from the design. I don’t know why I was expecting a more vibrant masculine fragrance. Maybe it was the name and bottle design that had me expecting an ozonic, zesty aroma. Testing from sample so can’t comment on longevity.', ""At first I get a fresh soapy scent. This is very light and very safe. This is like a nice soapy scent and what you get I assume is the galanga and the ginger and those two along with the green notes give you that soapy feel. The projection can be increased if more sprays are applied but it is a moderate scent and also I get maybe 7-8 hours on clothes. Later on you get almost an oily or perfume aura along with the soapiness but this gives the scent a richness while wearing it. I definitely think this is unisex also. This could go in a feminine direction and it's very clean and casual. This is a perfect work scent. I also get a slight ocean vibe in this as well and the bottle is very nice looking. The bottle is an eye catcher on any shelf or your dresser. I give this a 83/100."", 'I smell no Ginger at all. A fresh soapy fragrance with green notes. Why they names it Blv is beyond me. It is a very light and safe fragrance that is appropriate for any occasion. The scent is nice, but I will never wear it as I can get it from any old bar of soap. Nevertheless, it does smell okay. 6 hours longevity and mild sillage.', ""My signature scent for sure. 12 years of it and still going.. It's just an amazing perfume! The opening, the soapy drydown...

If you fi d it at a good price like I did it's worth a try."", 'Smells exactly like hand soap. Smells ok at first. But it´s very strong. After an hour or two I just can´t stand smelling it anymore and just want to wash it off.', ""I'm late to the party with this one. After years of having this on my buy list I finally bought a bottle earlier this summer and been wearing several times weekly all summer long. Absolutely love it! It's fresh and clean and yet unique. I was pleased to learn its not another boring shower gel scent. It's more of a soapy fresh than a citrus fresh. If that makes sense. Smells like freshly washed clothes but in a classy way like expensive hotel soap or Italian shaving cream. I get decent performance too which surprised me because my skin eats up fresh scents. It's now a summer staple in my rotation and will probably be for a long time to come."", 'Good but not exciting.', ""@Dirtyhoody I strongly agree with you, because I purchased it 3 years ago and the performance was horrible on my dry skin, so I convinced a friend of mine to try it and he has a normal skin, once again the performance was a thumbs down.. he said that it became a skin scent after 1 hour or 2 hours.. Now I know that the issue wasn't with my skin chemistry.. Don't get me wrong, it has a wonderful aroma but sadly so weak.."", ""I compared a newly purchased bottle to a 4 year old bottle my dad has in his stash. I strongly believe it has been reformulated and weakened significantly. I noticed this in both wearings and on paper. The smell is identical but the oomph is gone.  This one has gone the way of la nuit de l'homme. A shadow of it's former self."", ""Great spring, summer scent. Smells very clean, like you've just stepped out of the shower. and this feeling last for a very long time thanks for the musk notes in it.  Perfect for the work place as it does not disturb the wearer or anybody around him. The ginger gives it a slight edge and modernity, but mostly this is a tamed fragrance for a masculine but gentle man."", ""This is one of my all-time favorites. Bvlgari Blv opens up with a nice, spicy feel. After about an hour, it evolves into a semi sweet, warm, welcoming fragrance. It reminds me of a nice candle on a colder day.

It's one of the first scents that got me into the world of fragrance."", ""This is the all time greatest blu scent ever made. One of Bvlgaris top fragrances at that, even for a designer scent. Timeless. A top grade Masculine scent. Not the fruity sweet flowery stuff. The perfumer out did himself. You have to be a master blender in order to blend tobacco the correct way period. Not many can blend that heavy scent right. Elegant. The Tobacco, Juniper, Galanga notes was ridiculous great. You will always receive attention. A Masterpiece classic. I'm on my 4th bottle.

This feels like a winter fragrance, it could definitely pierce through the cold. Those saying the performance is bad, are incorrect. This lasts a long time on my skin, and projects like crazy cause of the ginger. 2-3 sprays minimum. Beautiful scent that unfortunately is not suitable for me."", ""The smell upon application is fresh , clean and soapy, but the biggest problem is there absolutely 0 sillage and 0 longevity. No one can smell you unless you're almost 6 inches away and even then it's very faint. Not worth it at all."", ""powder, Powder, Powder! I get a massive hit of baby powder.

I need time to know how I feel about a fragrance. Often, I make impulsive purchases at first sniff - and five dates down, they're in the relegated bag! I'll update my reviews about my experiences and if you're someone like me, maybe it'll help you make better financial decisions Haha! Happy Sniffing! Blv was not a quick buy. I kept sniffing this at my local retailer before finally purchasing it. There is something about this that I really like. It's not overly masculine, and has a very subtle spicy and warm nature. I cant really pin point notes in it though. The ginger, cardamom and other spices are not distinctly noticeable to my nose but all lend a spirited spiciness to the over tone. The downside of that is it does smell quite perfume-ish to me with a nondescript scent. I wish the green notes were stronger - that would have made this more interesting I think. Blv is fairly strong for the first 2 to 3 hours and then becomes softer and lasts for about 5 to 6 hours. Doesn't change much from wet to dry. I like how this smells on clothes - very warm and comforting. I have received compliments on this one. Great office scent because it is not offensive at all, and you can lather it without worrying about offending anyone. UPDATE Today I finished my last spritz of Blv - I've enjoyed wearing it but don't think I will repurchase. a good one time buy. Loved the bottle so hated that I had to junk it."", ""It's safe almost too safe. Not one thing about this stirs the senses. Maybe that's just what you're looking for out of a fragrance for work and that's totally fine. But to me, BLV could be The Office's own, Toby Flenderson of fragrances. Pleasant, does the job he's supposed to, but lacking any trace of balls or memorability. Will get squashed by any other fragrance in the area. But maybe it's better than nothing. Your choice. Wouldn't reccomend to young guys looking for a powdery scent, in that case I can't think of any better suiting than Burberry Touch"", 'Smells like a dove soap. Good smell though, if you like to smell like straight out of shower.

Forget niche for a while and get yourself a bottle of this masterpiece!"", 'Blv pour Homme (Perfectly unisex by the way) by Bvlgari gives off an aroma of just coming out of the shower, fresh and clean and with the smell of your lightly scented soap still lingering on your damp skin. Because this is what this one smells like, notwithstanding the notes: A bar of soap that was under the water not so long ago. Not the super expensive fancy bar you buy in a high-end cosmetic store nor the cheap one at the Dollar-store, but rather the popular brand at your grocery store. But with the very low price it can be found for, online at least, it’s worth it to me. In my opinion it smells like the perfumer wanted to create a bar of soap made with YSL L’Homme’s top, with the semi-fresh spicy ginger, and surrounded by the base of a ""lemonless"" Chanel Allure Edition Blanche or even Frapin’s L’Humaniste with a creamy but dry/a bit sharp sandalwood/vanilla combo with a slightly wet, green aura added to it.  If the more popular Prada Amber is too powdery, resinous or sweet for you but want something in the same vein, Bvlgari’s fragrance might be your huckleberry. Give it a shot. I enjoy it quite a lot more than other soapy/clean cheap popular designer releases such as Mugler Cologne or Nautica Voyage. Based on the way it smells, its longevity on me combined with its unobtrusive projection, it’d make a perfect office scent.', ""When I was in junior high, I was gifted a Deo Stick variant of this by my father. For some reason it had none of the top notes of the EdT - all it had was the dry down. That was HEAVENLY. I was not as impressed with the EdT when I revisited it 10 years later as I didn't like the Cardamom-y opening at all. That said, I still enjoyed the Gingery dry down very much."", ""The person below me said it smelled like clean sheets which I thought was an odd way of describing a scent, but I just tried Blv and it's a spot on description. It really does smell like fresh linen. It's soft, safe, comforting, and pleasant. I often like to wear a fragrance to bed and this will be perfect."", 'I massively misunderstood this when I first started wearin’ it. All I got was clean bed sheets from it. Which ain’t to say that’s bad, it’s quite nice. Everyone likes clean bed sheets, especially when the sheets in question ain’t yours.  Sorry. Tangent. Anyway. Fragrance.  It weren’t until months later when it reentered me rotation that I started pickin’ up on the ginger. Now I dunno how I went so long not gettin’ it. I think it’s ‘cause it’s a very clean, fresh ginger. Ginger’s one of them where if you ain’t careful with it you can turn anythin’ into the least talented Spice Girl. The fact I didn’t even think there was any in it at the beginnin’ should tell ya people knew what they were doin’ with it.

Warm weather frag, above-average warm weather performance on me.

Bottle was given away.', 'dentist room', 'i just got it today as gift pack include shower gel.shave balm .... realy nice woody fresh spicy fragrance', ""As usual per Bvlgari, it can't be anything common. This smells as if a fresh cold windy day somehow ended up in a bottle of champaigne and brought along a few clouds, who are a bit confused as to what on earth are they doing there. It has this fresh, airy fizziness that can be read as powderiness, but it ain't powder, its kind of, well, cloud bubbles would be the best way to describe it. Quite unique as a fragrance and well worth trying and even blind buying, as it is almost impossible not to like at least something in it.  Also, as the name implies, this smells blue, but not the Bleu de Chanel dark, blues, blue but a vivid, almost turqoise blue. It's for the spring mostly, but can be used during the fall, and, maybe, just maybe, in summer but I think it'll come across as a bit too heavy when the temperature rises above 30 C°. If there is a downside to it, it's the linearity, as that's Bvlgari's Achilles heel that they never seem to overcome. I'm starting to think that they are doing that on purpose, as a trademark, and in all honesty their products are, mostly, so good out of the box (bottle) that it kind of makes sense. Lasts some 6 to 8 hours, projects decently but not fantasticaly for some two of them and leaves a nice sillage, even if not for too long.

What do you do? Well, if the zing of ginger is something that you find refreshing then say no more Bvlgari BLV has you covered! BLV has become one of my all time favorite summer fragrances. BLV is a real pleasure to wear and congers up memories of lounging pool side and staring straight at a clear blue sky. The opening of BLV is pure gingery powder with a touch of cardamom and a very sweet tobacco blossom. BLV besides having a fizzy ginger element, also has this really faint juniper note that I feel forms the foil to the ginger in this scent, creating a near perfect balance between the ginger and powdery essence of this scent. The teakwood and sandalwood come in to give the scent a warm, rich woody base. BLV as a whole is a beauty of a warm weather scent, with its' light florals, woods and fresh, spicy ginger. The notes are well separated and are not at all cloying. BLV feels clean powdery and fresh and is really something different to wear on a sunny, warm day. BLV can be worn by the twenty year old crowd all the way to the late thirties crowd. This fragrance has longevity so it works well during the day and would work well in the office. BLV as I have stated is a warmer weather fragrance and works great in spring and summer. Bvlgari BLV is another reasonably priced scent from a real quality house, so for me it is full bottle worthy. BLV is the scent you wear when you were just swimming and tanning by the pool and you still want to relive that relaxing moment on your skin and in your nose. Give BLV a few sprays when you just swam a few lengths, tanned, showered off the Banana Boat and are ready to relax on your porch or balcony for the rest of the day before meeting up with friends for a bbq."", 'Powderly formal, it smells like baby powder with a masculine edge.', ""I've had this one for awhile now and I never gave it a fair shake. It grew on me. Especially being so hot, not having to wear something aquatic or citrus is a bonus. It opens a bit soapy and sharp like a lot of soapy scents do. However, about 20 minutes in the cardamom and sandalwood really come out. I never really lose the cardamom but the flowery aspects of the composition start to show themselves after a few hours. It remains more fresh than floral though. I got about 7-8 hours out of it with moderate sillage. For the price tag, I would consider that a good buy. This one could be used for all occasions and by most age groups, possibly even women. It's quite inoffensive and pleasant to the nose."", ""This one smells ...I can't say it smells like an old grandfather. Sorry BLV. It's too spicy and overly masculine in my eye.

Not being familiar with tobacco blossom or galangal I have to wonder if it's one of these? Owing to my status as a Bvlgari slut, I was surprised not to be a huge fan of this, but that honey-like accord just went a little too funky on me (maybe a little closer to over-ripe fruit?).

Longevity and projection are on the low end of moderate. I do not recommend. Sorry, but for me this is a dis-like. This was the worst of the five Bvlgari fragrances in my mini-bottle collection.

Also, even though the note is not listed on there, to me this cologne has a ""lemony"" vibe to it. However, when I pay attention to the scent I can smell the ginger and cardamom in it as these are the two notes that stand out the most. To me, this cologne seems to fit more of a ""khakis and button-up shirt"" look and I tend to dress more casual or athletic so it is safe to say that I have not had the chance to wear this out in public. However, I will be giving it a go soon to see how it works for me. As of right now, I would give this cologne the following ratings: Scent: 4.0/5 Sillage: 3.0/5 Longevity: 3.5/5 Value: 4.0/5 Overall: 3.6/5', 'I love this scent and wear it daily. Its none intrusive and i wear just one spray on the upper chest under work attire (i work in an office so i cannot be too offensive).

It reminds me so much of Chanel's Allure Edition Blanche, minus the citrus, so if you liked that one's creamy-smooth base, you'll probably love this. There's nothing stereotypically masculine about it, which is fine, but it's a bit *too* smooth and sweet for my taste, with nothing to cut the sweetness. I don't dislike it - it's simple and comforting - but I think I'll be sticking to Prada's Amber pour Homme for my go-to soapy smell."", ""Scent & Qualiy: 8/10 Longevity: 8/10 Sillage: 8/10 Creativity & Uniqueness: 8/10 Affordability: 9/10 My Overall score: 8,2/10 i love this fragrance since last ten years..

This would layer very nicely with Montblanc Presence to add some greener notes.  It is fairly linear and has a warmer smelling drydown then Prada Amber so if you want a cleaner ""safe"" scent that doesn\'t fill a room, I can easily suggest this for cooler months as an office scent as it stands up well.

Well, I find that it lasts for more than 12 hours on me and that it works in any kind of weather. The projection is strong but subtle. There is always a wonderful gentle waft of Blv in the shower the following morning (I spray a little in my hair) as the metaphorical magic carpet flies away at the break of a new day. The main note is ginger but not in a way that you would expect. Blv settles into a lovely mix of green notes within a lovely warm, woody base and a little galanga and jasmine mixing with the ginger.  This one is just pure class. Subtle, warm and elegant, multilayered and so damned good! I have worn this almost since it came out about fourteen years ago and it was my favourite then and it remains my favourite now, dozens of perfumes later. Alas, I was lulled into a false sense of security by the presence of Blv Pour Homme on the Bvlgari website. Sadly, a phonecall to the Sloane Street HQ in London revealed that Blv has been discontinued. If anyone has any of it left, I am always interested in taking it off your hands!

One of my favourites from this brand.', 'Pros: - Extremely fresh with a great ginger notes - Feels like a ""dry"" fragrance - Simple scent nothing complicated - Has extreme longevity - Unisex - Almost has a citrus (lemon) smell to it - Similiar to Nautica fragrances but different enough to distinguish between the two Cons: - Extremely strong cologne on first/over application (induces headaches) - Too much of a baby-powder scent / soap / detergent - Although unisex it comes off as more feminine - Flowery notes are a but overpowering on drydown A decent long-lasting fragrance that reminds me of the numerous Nautica colognes as well as Alfred Sung Hei. This is a ""dry"" feeling, clean, and fresh cologne that is great for hot days. The ginger is strong and gives off a scent that is similiar to lemon. The scent may be considered a bit too fresh, with powerful flower and powdery notes, much of them resembling baby powder. That can cause it to smell much more on the feminine side of things. This could possibly be used in the work environment / meeting new people but only if used sparingly. Overapplication can induce headaches and overpower the surrounding area quite easily. All that said it is still kind of a simple fragrance, if you are used to more complicated ones this will be boring to you. Overall its a decent fresh cologne, not something I personally want more of, but if you are looking for something for a fresh scent that can last over 6 hours, this is a pretty good choice.', 'Good juice, i dont wear it that much but it is very good, last a whole work shift +, and its at TJ max 20$ for 2.5 so you cant loss', 'Smells great, but it doesn\'t project at all on me and even if I spray 10 times, it lasts 30 min at best.

At first inhale, I was unsure what to make of it… not feminine, imo, but not a typical “man scent” either. It’s quite unique. I quickly grew to love it and went through the bulk of a 1oz bottle fairly quickly. Clean, airy, extremely powdery, elegant, subtle. It is fresh yet not citrus and, perhaps, romantic but not outright sexy. I believe it’s much softer and quite a bit less woody or spicy than the notes on this page would suggest. The ginger component was obvious once I knew to look for it but otherwise I think all the notes work together to create one smooth, harmonious experience.  It seems like a mostly linear scent and once it settles down on your skin, what you smell is mostly what you get. This easily lasts 8 hours on me and can linger much longer as a skin scent or on clothing. I think BLV is flexible enough for most any occasion and any season. Though, personally, I’m most drawn to wear it during Winter and Spring.

There is an artificial element in there, or maybe the cedar was too strong, but it really didn't like what was happening on my skin. Later that evening the smell had degenerated to something like vinyl and powder. It's a shame, too, because the opening IS nice and holds a lot of promise.

Three days in, I must eat crow and tip my hat: What Dior brings with Higher isn't novel, but it's done with a balance and smoothness so exceptional it reinvents this fruity-aromaric genre to be interesting all over again.  Dior's 90s-00s masculine summer freshies, including Higher and Dune Pour Homme, have proven to be a wonderful change of pace from today's ambroxan-dominant or candy-sweet designers. They exude joy, sophistication, and a good-humored confidence. Standing in the year 2025 and looking back over the mountains of empty Bleu de Chanel, Sauvage, and Versace Eros bottles, Dior's previous generation stands as appreciable art.

More would likely be too much for the office."", 'Really good unique fragrance. Preety versatile, but i recommend it more for the summer. Really masculine, nothing super sweet, nothing super bold and loud, thats exactly how i like it. Yeah, smells kind of like 2003, but definitely nothing your grandpa or even dad would wears in his 20s. Very safe and very hard to dislike, so it is not a extreme compliment getter, but to school/work, it definitely wont hurt and girls would like it. I dont recommend it as a blind buy tho, may not suit everyones taste, and it is 110bucks here, which is a lot. It is not versace eros, so it wont last 12 hours and people wont smell it from 10 feet away - but i take that as a plus.', 'I’m wearing this now.

It’s not old fashioned but it’s not modern or sweet. It’s pretty expensive but it’s worth the cost in my opinion. It’s intoxicating and tempting to overspray but a little goes a long way, even in winter. Probably better suited to summer but I wear it year round. Pear and I don’t know what else but whatever it is it compliments the pear. I think it’s unisex. Safe and inoffensive but still striking and stand out. I’m surprised more people don’t know about this. I always considered that a good thing but it probably means it’s soon for the chop like most of my favourite fragrances. I really hope not though.

I'd just sprayed the precious few leftover drops in my 50ml bottle from 2016.

I bought it when I was 17. I finished my last bottle a decade or so ago, and I missed it so I found it for sale on a discounter site online. Originally this was released in 2001. The promotional advertisement showed a young man in a fighter jet. The marketing failed because as we know 9/11 sadly occured that year. This fragrance never really became popular due to the disastrous marketing promotion. It's a shame because this is a great fragrance. In North America, it was to be the first mainline fragrance for men since Dune for Men which came out in 1997. Higher was released and aimed towards a younger demographic. A couple years after this was released, there was a flanker called Higher Energy that was released. Sadly both were discontinued in North America in the mid 2000's, but are still available on Dior's UK website and online discounters. Dior Higher is a woody aromatic scent that is a very versatile fragrance for daily wear. It is fresh scent that is a bit spicy and woody. There is an interesting accord of pear and cypress. This is an easy reach for me when I don't know what to wear. It's great to wear at the office, or relaxing at home, even going out. I find the lasting power to be decent for a fresh scent. When I wear fragrances like this I am not expecting it to last 10-12 hours. It's a bright scent that makes me feel happy. It might not be the most unique scent, but I prefer it to a lot of the mainstream scents that all start to smell the same. An underrated gem!"", 'Underrated classic! A staple of fresh masculine scents. Gentlemanly but youthful I love it!', ""Higher Dior An underrated Dior Classic from 2001, discontinued. Higher should still be available in some discounters and fragrances warehouses. It opens with a melon like lovely fruitiness from the pear, peach and lemon, smelling nice and fresh. The opening is pretty short-lived on my skin as it goes herbal spicy fast with the cypress, rosemary pepper and a prominent basil. Higher is rather soft in terms of silage and projects just for the wearer and stays as a strong skin scent for a number of hours.  Higher has somehow stayed under the radar due to the market's numerous sports fragrances releases during the 2000s, similarly for the Higher Energy flanker. Despite this, it's still a good scent and profile to visit as scent profile of modern day designers aren't similar."", 'I stumbled upon one of the original formulations - the silver bottle with rubber sprayer. This is exactly what I expected, nice clean fragrance. Nothing spectacular- along the lines of CK Euphoria/Lacoste Challenge. Just a clean soapy frag with hints of citrus.

Funny enough, this fragrance is more modern and interesting than when it came out. At the time, fresh aquatics sport flankers were dominating the market and this one kinda felt generic in a way. today it seems refreshing and uplifting. A classic that Dior have kept in their catalog fortunately. Nice, masculine, fresh, unique.', ""I'm not at all into fresh nor fruity fragrances, but the way these were done in the early 2000's hits completely different. This is the only 'freshie' I own in my collection because unlike most in that category, this one does not feel generic. Whereas nowadays' most hyped fresh fragrances go borderline sweet with screeching fruity top notes on heavy ambroxan bases, this however represents the other end of the spectrum: it's original and well-blended, with subtle fruity/aromatic top notes on a woody/musky base.  I'd agree this to be one of the most underrated Dior mens fragrances, if not the most. It was kind of forgotten with the Dior Homme line being launched a few years after. The vintage aluminium bottle with the white plastic square in the center has very good performance. No-brainer spring/summer scent."", 'To me this is unisex perfection.

That said, Dior’s Higher is less angular, altogether smoother and has the beautifully rendered pear accord. It doesn’t smell like a 70s shampoo but it does lend an unexpected fruity touch.  A solid like. It’s nice to have found a summer scent that’s not tropically fruity or citrus based.', ""The first time I smelled it (which was two weeks ago), I was stunned because of how great this one smelled like. Fresh, a bit green, fruity, woody, aromatic, and just really pleasant for me. I'm actually fine seeing the fact that this fragrance does not last long nor projects that well. I think it is one of those classic, great smelling fragrances that can be easily overlooked (like YSL's Kouros, for example). My only regret is that, I didn't get it at the time when I can easily get it for a very good price."", 'Hands down this is the best men perfume ever! The beginning is so clean with sophisticated dry down that last 8++ hours. Spent maybe 4-5 bottles during my 29-35 yo. Its just too bad that this gem is discontinued.', 'Absolutely the most underrated Dior mens fragrance of all time!  In 2001 my family and I moved to a large city in Mexico, and during those first days there, we went to a mall and I remember seeing lots of Higher ads displayed outside a large department store, it was the perfume of the moment. My dad bought it and it was his to go fragrance from 2001 to 2003. Since then I was in love with the scent, but it was later kind of forgotten when the Dior Homme line was launched. Almost 20 years later I had the chance of buying one of the first batches from this beautiful fragrance, the one I remember my dad wore, Aluminium bottle with the white plastic insert in the center. A very “new Millenium” aesthetic, which I absolutely adore. To me it’s exactly what I imagine a Dior model smells. There was I think this idea that perfumery, during those early 2000s years, was about simplicity and smartness in the use of ingredients. Higher is fruity, clean, musky…it’s all about the pear note, very realistic. Higher also has all the points to be a timeless fragrance: very wearable, all season, for every occasion but without being generic at all, you can over spray it and you won’t offend anybody and it can totally be worn today; all this is what makes it great IMHO. I haven’t tried the newer versions but this one has very good performance, projection is decent the first three ours, then in gets close to the skin, and longevity about 7-8 hours. Overall a 9/10', ""🤔 Higher eau de toilette was one of my favorite fragrances from the house of Dior. Except it doesn't last long on the skin after two hours it's completely gone from my skin. Dior needs to bring this one back except in a eau de parfum consentration but, this time with longer staying power. Last time I tried to buy this bottle online I found out the house of Dior stoped making many years ago or at least you can't find a brand new bottle here in the states.🤭"", 'Oh I do love the original version of Higher and that funky metal flacon.  They really should’ve kept that.  It was as distinctive and iconically millennial as Rush for Men’s white plastic box.  In my mind it is a memory trigger forever associated with the first years of the new millennium. Fresh, crisp, optimism.', ""I'm really surprised by how much I ended up liking this. The majority of the time I go back to older fragrances that are beloved, I see why people have grown attached to them and have strong positive feelings for them but I find that a lot of the time the DNA is just a bit old-hat and that there are more exciting avenues to explore but with this one...it's just so good. It's beyond reproach. Chanel and Dior are of course the top of the pyramid as far as designers so I shouldn't be too surprised but I don't think this has lost any luster. Can easily be a signature scent for office or casual. Incredibly handsome and natural smelling.

I get cantaloupe, basil and musk."", ""Like a mix of CK Truth Men and Ralph Lauren Romance for Men with more emphasis on fruits.

If you enjoy pear fragrances, or would like to give one a try and enjoy versatile safe clean scents that are fresh and masculine i highly reccomend.

Higher and Acqua Di Gio were my first five fragrances and what got me hooked.  I loved Higher more than ADG however. Such a wonderful spring/summer fragrance.  Around that time, I started impulse buying fragrances at the malls and I owned around 15-20 in a matter of a few years.  So why is that relevant? With 15+ fragrances that I’ve owned, Higher is one of two fragrances that I actually managed to empty. I sprayed it so damn much because it smelled so good to me. I’d pick this over anything else at that time.  Not sure what it’s like now. The scent was great. I’m sure the longevity is horrendous by now. Considering it must’ve been reformulated countless of times.  I’d say it’s a great blind buy for 18-30 years. It’s cheap and smells good.

Now I really want to smell Higher Energy and I think I'll blind buy it next summer."", ""A very light and fresh, summer/spring fragrance with very moderate projection and low duration, but nice nonetheless. I get a very sharp anise opening that fades quickly into some woody fragrance which incredibly fades into a sweet layer of peach or melon and a very present ambergris that gives it some tingle on the nose (most probably ambroxan).  I think it's the inspiration for this year's YSL Y Eau De Parfum, but with a less sharp ambergris than this one, as it has very similar notes. I'm rediscovering this one totally by chance, as I've found a half full aluminium bottle from the original 2001 edition in an old cabinet in my house which was forgotten or misplaced or go figure how it ended there. I wasn't much into frags back then so I didn't pay too much attention to it being missing but I'm glad to have found it back.

I can understand the comparisons to the color white and the season of spring/summer. One thing that this fragrance has going for it, is that it's a counterpart to popular synthetic ambroxan bombs like Dylan Blue, YSL Y EDP, Code Colonia and Sauvage.

I have taken longer than 15 years to repurchase a vintage aluminium bottle, and well, it is still an interesting fragrance, an unusual fruity masculine with an spicy-green character... but after this time something in its formula puts me off... Several months wearing it and now I know it is due to the peach note, totally out of control, rottenly sweet, even uncapable to be balanced by the plethora of green and spicy notes: basil, rosemary, cypress, cold spices. Still the fruity and woody pear accords are memorable and overall this fragrance is one of a kind so I cannot stop thinking if that peach note is responsible of Higher's not being the great classic it should be. I have also checked the new crystal bottles now in stores and the feeling is exactly the same: a Higher fall from grace.

I find a well-scented aroma, delicate, subtle, pale, with aquatic nuances. The beginning feels fresh as the breeze of a spring, light, not overloading, with a very juicy pear note with a very aromatic point, of classic lines that evolves towards a drier woody, with nuances powdered without losing that initial touch of The pear and that fuses sensational in skin. I like it, and although the duration is correct has a great against, in this case the projection that is very weak, rather it seems a scent skin and it dazzles quite a bit, since it soon becomes very stuck to skin and for the price it has I find nothing in proportion.

Its little feminine side added to your manly scent acts as a head turner for girls. Other men ignore this scent in shops since it has a little feminine scent.

The drydown is more fruity / powdery. almost floral (but very subtly so). Extremely pleasing on every level. To my nose, the Higher shares DNA with Dior Higher Energy.

The pear is very mellow but still fresh, and is just gorgeous against the basil. The whole fragrance smells extremely natural – not synthetic at all.  This fragrance gives off the impression of a feisty, charming, adventurous young man far back in the Middle Ages, maybe Robin Hood or Link from the Legend of Zelda. It feels perfectly appropriate for jaunting around the woods, saving princesses, and slaying goblins with your bow and arrow.

It's one of those Dior fragrances that are often kept in the dark. Dior Higher just needs more recognition, more fans to come forward and speak of their love for it. Dior Higher is the scent of a sexy man. Think of a toned and tanned male swimmer; the faint smell of chlorine lingering on his skin, intermingling with the scent of his fruity hair gel and smeared sunscreen, and there you have Higher.  Pear is not a note you smell a lot of in masculine fragrances. I'm quite enjoying this unique, fruity spin on things. If I were to describe Dior Higher in fragrance terms, it's a slightly clean and fruity scent, with an odd oceanic and herbaceous approach. When you first spray Dior Higher, you think you've got it all figured out. In the initial stages it may strike you as bland and insipid, but do wait it out. Dior Higher gets better as the fragrance progresses. It has an alluring heart of rosemary, peach, pear, cypress and basil, which can't be explained in words, it has to be smelt. Dior Higher is really quite complex, which was not what I expected to find in such a boring bottle as this one. It's a fantastic, fresh daytime scent, which to my nose, stands out a mile from other citrus based colognes on the market today. It's hard to categorize Dior Higher, as it is clean, aromatic, herbaceous, aquatic, fruity, citrusy and woodsy all rolled into one.

(Bottle? Please don't mind on my vocabulary) The scent? Pear at its best. You could smell the pear notes along with aromatics especially basil with subtle rosemary notes.

I do not like the opening nor the first two hours more or less of it, but do find the spicy drydown quite interesting, because as for male scents I do prefer oriental and spicy scents. This scent's best quality is from my viewpoint the progression.

It's cheap and that's what you get longevity wise. D&G the one is 3-4 times the price of this, performs worse, yet people still love it.

Citrus heavy. I find ""Theoreme"" by Rue Broca comparable, altho the citruses in it are more zingy. Dries down to a very similar, warm, ambery/ambroxany combo. I slightly prefer the citrus in this (it has a touch more depth and is sweeter), but it\'s not that big of a deal and super subjective, plus Theoreme lasts freaking ages AND keeps the citrus. You can\'t beat that. You\'d go noseblind to it before it goes away. /edit : Turathi Blue isn\'t too far removed from this theme either, altho it\'s different and Theoreme might match up better  $0.2 🍻', 'smells amazing but it only last around 1-2 hour minimum.', 'This was my first cologne a few years ago. Despite the performance I actually liked this one very much. If you are looking for a green freshie on a budget look no further.

With a real EDP concentration, this perfume would be a winner. The way this scent is marketed, longevity lasts up to 3~3.5 hours and sillage is no bigger than an arm\'s length. - It\'s very versatile, but bear in mind its low performance. It is unmistakably a fresh spicy fragrance with citrus notes and green herbs accords. Sweetness? None whatsoever! - The bottle is not pretty but it\'s also not tacky. And it even comes with a real wooden cap. My opinion: I always like to have an EDC at hand and I do own quite a few. I judge this fragrance on a pair with ""Agua de Colonia Concentrada"" citrus EDC by Alvarez Gómez, another Spanish very good EDC although not similar to Mediterraneo.

I bought it from Fragrancebuy.ca and just looked, it is still available on the cheap. Fir, Cypress and Cedar are prominent in the dry down, opens airy and green. It’s ok, not offensive and fine for summer. Has a slight “cleaner” kind of vibe.

This is not something I would wear around people I may see again, that includes the gym because this does have a cleaning chemicals vibe going on and I will wear this this is for yard work, washing the car, weekend errands to Home Depot (hardware store, etc), where you simply want to have a fresh and clean but small/private scent bubble.

I truly only get 2 hours max with this as far as longevity and intimate projection. I\'d say this is certainly office safe and perfect for office use. It\'s bright and amicable. Keep in your drawer or in the car for a quick freshen up and to even brighten your mood. It stands tall among the fallen razor sharp citrus scents for men in the early 2000s.

The air enters the room blowing the tule curtain carrying the aroma of dewey grasses and forest undergrowth. A slightly medicinal, naturalistic, and herbaceous aromatic scent.

Only downside is its only moderate performance. Still well worth getting.', ""The perfumer was making an artistic statement with the fragrance design. It's sky blue juice that smells green like looking up at the clear, blue sky in a forest of fragrant, green trees. That's the feeling of inhaling clean air surrounded by nature aka oxygèn(e). It's clean and fresh but it's not aquatic. That cypress note gives the fragrance a green slant in the opening and sets the tone for what is to come. This is a green, herbal, slightly spicy and woody offering. It's very different from your average fresh scent but it's right up my alley so this goes down as a win for me. It certainly left a good impression on the Mrs with the first spray. A few hours of longevity with minimal projection and negligible sillage from my bottle but at this price, just respray when you want your nature fix.

Compliments at close-range however.', ""I'm a huge fan of bargain hunting, in all aspects of life, whether it be fragrances, clothing, or any other product or experience I'm searching for. The hunt for hidden gems that deliver high value for low cost is a worthwhile quest I enjoy embarking on. Repeatedly.  Enter Lanvin Oxygene Homme. As far as fragrances that can be had for under $20 USD, Oxygene deserves a closer look. Far from perfect, it still offers a potential value proposition for those who are looking for something fresh while eschewing the familiar men's blue and aquatic tropes.  The opening is sharp, synthetic, and veers into laundry detergent territory, and made me think I made a mistake picking this up. Thankfully, the sharpness smooths out somewhat within about 15 minutes, which seems to be common for a lot of budget fragrances. Ignore the top notes, and soon the evergreen notes start to intermingle with vague herbal freshness, and the cedar musk base.  I think the heart and base notes of this one smell quite good, but unfortunately the only real projection I get is from the top notes that I don't love. As it dries down, it quickly becomes a skin scent. By the final drydown, the particular musk and cedar combo approaches a mundane greatness. Even if it is not going to blow your mind - the simplicity is what succeeds here. I wish the sharper top and mid notes would have been toned down, improved, or left out completely. The base notes that linger are where this smells the best.  This could be a dumb reach for me on hot and humid days where I want a close skin scent, that smells fresh, unobtrusive (after the drydown) and subtly delivers some forest-y notes in the context of a Y2K style freshie. I think the Oxygene title here is fitting, and I don't really get much marine or obvious aquatic notes here.  Sel Marin is in a completely different ballpark, as that's actually seaweedy and aquatic, and is higher quality all around. Same for Bvlgari Aqua, although that is also a step down from Sel Marin, but above Oxygene in quality.  This actually plays more in the same ballpark as Azzaro Chrome Aqua, or maybe Davidoff Horizon, even if they don't smell alike side by side, the combo of cheap price points and mash up of obviously synthetic accords balanced with natural touchpoints makes them cousins in the land of fresh cheapies. All of them ever so slightly dip their toes outside the box, but are ultimately constrained by what I assume are low cost materials. Worth a pick up if you can keep your expectations neutral to low, and want some forest adjacent notes packaged in what is overall a generic (by design?) office/close quarters friendly spring/summer scent. Ultimately, there are some sharper, synthetic feeling notes to this keep it from a love, but there is enough to like here to hold on to my bottle and see if oxidation causes any favorable maturation of the scent. Oxygene has an interesting concept, and nearly succeeds in nailing a wonderful scent experience out of it, but ends up only competing in the lower price points rather than transcending it's cheap price."", 'This is a Wonderful Scent, Fresh, Crisp, Green, Herbal, Airy and Unique. It reminds me of Forest, Jungle and their Trees, lakes . It opens up with a bit sharp fresh spicy, green and spices notes in the background then dry down is Earthy, Musky and Woody. If you like a fresh spicy perfume with Unique note and style, You will like this one. It has a very unique composition and A masterful Well-blended. Longevity is good, I really enjoy it when the weather is warm. Highly Recommended.  Thumbs Up.  Rating : 8 / 10', ""I'm not a fan of aquatic fragrances, but this certainly isn't a typical aquatic. It starts off with a scent that has a green, salad-like quality, but within a short period of time there is that cold air element, which dominates the dry down. The green elements are still present but in the background. Interestingly, i never get a clear wood note here. Overall, this is quite interesting, and I am happy to own a bottle, though that is only because I found one in a bargain bin. I would not pay full price for this because I am not a fan of the genre and I already have some other scents that are in the same general ballpark. I would advise not to wear this in the winter, has it is clearly a warm weather fragrance. Longevity seems to be at least good and projection seems to be moderate, though definitely not bad. I think it's also worthwhile to point out that nothing smells offensive here, even though it clearly is not entirely natural smelling, it does not come across as synthetic to me. However, if you smell it up close, you may find it to be somewhat irritating. UPDATE: The far drydown is mostly a slightly musky cedar, which is consistent with the note pyramid. It's not just iso e super but instead smells reasonably natural. It's not very exciting but it should work well in warm weather."", 'Atypical aquatic cologne.  Fresh, camphoraceous and…vegetative? It makes me feel like I\'m walking in a forest / shaddy lane with lots of camphor trees and wet and verdant grounds. (One day during an interval btwn two showers I strolled along a road with lots of blomming camphor trees, the moist aroma of blossoms, trees and wet earth suddenly reminded me of Oxygène, though the latter is certainly a bit more complex.) It must be the combination of myrtle and juniper as listed in the moddle notes.  It\'s also reminiscent of dated cosmetics I smelled as a child (likely due to cedar which is prominent during the end). It\'s so soothingly ""green"" as the main accords on this page. People around me seem to like it. A very unique spring/summer juice that\'s not citrusy or minty. Yet it may drew polar reactions, so try before you buy, if it\'s still available. It\'s been discontinued for some time, just like its cousin Aquaman, which suggests that guys today are not so into this type.  I think it shines in late spring and summer evenings.', ""What can I say about Oxygene Homme that has not been said yet? I'm not a fan of this fragrance. I'm gonna keep this short and sweet, The presentation is great, the atomizer could be better but it works just fine.  The juice I got is like a wintergreen mint color, not blue like I see in most pictures. The opening is very sharp, earthy and salty. If you ever got a face full of grass and dirt and maybe a little of your own blood on a pouring day while playing football with your buddies, this is exactly the smell I get. that first minute is INTENSE to my nose.  after that first minute, the smell eases up and becomes a wet forest scent, pine needles, cypress, cedar and wet dew. like soaking wet, as if you emerged from a cave into the forest after the monsoon storm has passed. Now here is where it gets a touch interesting, the scent smells like a earthier version of Pino Silvestre Original for the next 20 minutes. but wait, this particular fragrance DNA mutates into a psuedo Pino Silvestre Original / Polo Blue combo, leaving your skin with a touch of pine and aquatics. The scent last on my skin for about an hour and dissipates into nothingness.  Not a fan of this rollercoaster. The scent at the end of its life reminds me of Polo Blue's drydown. It's not bad but its weak in comparison."", 'Undetectable in 30 minutes - returned it, along with Lanvin Sport, for the same reason.', 'In 1977, Disques Dreyfus released in the USA, Oxygene, Jean-Michel Jarre\'s 40-minute electronic music magnum opus. In 2001, Lanvin released Oxygene Homme, perhaps among the best of Alberto Morillas\' fragrance orchestrations. Both the music and the perfume are French, multi-layered, breezy, sweeping, confident, sophisticated, masterful, and both open with fresh air ""in progress"" (listen to the very beginning of Oxygene, to hear my reference to ""in progess""). They both subtly reveal an increased sense of richness with each subsequent listening/wearing, which engenders an enlarging sense of appreciation for their greatness over time. Perhaps most valuable of all, they both avoid trendy fashion; they are both timeless classics.', ""No vetiver in the pyramid? Maybe it's the wormwood doing it. Could have also called it seaweed, but something green and salty is lurking in that bottle (the dill pickle comments below are funny, but kinda true). As such, I can certainly see the Sel Marin comparison although it's more of a similar impression than one being a dupe of the other.  There's this black pepper and cypress thing in the opening much like Jil Sander for Men but it quickly gets into an Iso E Super overdose in the vein of Encre Noire, Terre d'Hermes, and Declaration. If you know that cedary, salty, vetiver and conifer thing I'm talking about be warned or rejoice, depending on your preferences. It's intense.  I for one like it quite a bit, but be aware that I think Bvlgari Aqva, Sel Marin, and things of a similarly salty, funky variety are high art. There's also a little something of a citrus note in here, starting as a nice bergamot but developing into something more like a salted lime before a tequila shot.  Kudos to Alberto Morillas for this one. It's a keeper."", 'Got this by accident after Fragrantica\'s link to Fnet lead me to the Homme instead of the original. Glad I\'m fine wearing men\'s scents cause when I finally realized the mistake, I was already pleasantly wearing it in some fashion everyday.

It\'s like a kind of light blue-ish water, with some green, vaguely floral plants thrown in. For this purpose (and I have trouble imagining many others), it\'s well suited. Affordable, so you can go completely crazy with it. Not overtly projecting, so nobody will think you\'re trying too hard when it\'s only a workout or short-term, casual activity.

Oxygene homme opens very brightly, lovely & refreshing, before quickly becoming a closer yet still cooling light green scent. I first sprayed on a paper strip and wasn't a fan as it was too 'herbal' however on my skin it is far more appealing (if I may say so myself :P ) and nuanced. It has that special 'designer' freshness mastered by the perfumer Alberto Morillas in countless fragrances over the years.  So a good alternative to the plethora of citrus based warm weather freshies? It certainly seems that way. I urge people to check it out if they want something a little different but not too challenging either. However don't be expecting 'beast mode' fragrance as this is a subtle yet inviting light & airy scent but not without it's charms.  To be continued... UPDATE; low sillage and projection but quite long-lasting for me. UPDATE 2; I decided to move this one on to someone who would appreciate it more. It is a nice scent, however I like to only keep frags that I'll wear (plus a select few special scents to sniff now & again) and I just felt like I probably wouldn't wear it due to having some similar yet slightly less herbal fragrances which appeal to me more. I'll say it again, this is a herbal one (I was reminded of dill vinaigrette), it's not heavy or super strong but is a surprisingly good performer, or at least it was for me. I would say if possible try before you buy, even if it is inexpensive these blind buys all add up!"", ""First bought this roughly 10 years ago, loved it, found it fresh and uplifting. Recently repurchased it for old times' sake, not bad, but can't help thinking I smell like a bunch of chopped herbs just before being dunked in a good, hearty soup.

The combination of herbs and coniferous trees is so relaxing and fresh. There is no sweetness in this one, so it all comes across as quite natural rather than ""cologney"". It is not an aquatic at all- I think the color of the juice is coloring opinions here. I can\'t see this offending a soul. Aaaand...that\'s the other story. Mr Morillas\'s sometimes achilles heel rears its head again: low performance. A few sprays lasted on my skin overnight, I can still smell it in the morning, but the projection is so very light. But as I think of it, a composition like this is perhaps meant to be ephemeral, especially considering its herbal heart. If it projected strongly, I think it would smell like a caricature of itself and become either cloying or obnoxious.

One may think that the name Oxygene can be interpreted as a scent with an aquatic character. What is really interesting is that Oxygene is mainly a herbal & spicy composition with an airy facet. Instead of a watery profile, upon spraying Oxygene you can feel blast of peppery freshness that will slowly transition into a blue hued woody airiness. It's the breeze in a forest, a forest near the sea.  I am reminded of Escada Sport Country Weekend, it has that forest airy character, but the Lanvin creation is more ethereal. It also comes across as a lighter minimalist version of Guy Laroche's Horizon.

I bought because I love fresh aquatic and airy fragrances, but this could not be more far removed from that.  When I first spray it on, it smells like stale black pepper mixed with a bunch of herbs and woods that all clash horribly. And while it's not listed on the notes,I get a putrid sour citrus smell that makes the whole thing a huge mess.

Now i came back to it and my opinion changed 180 degrees. This is not a cheap scent in my opinion although the price is. Give it time to evolve, You will like it if you like woody perfumes.  I will be wearing this to the gym and at home. I still have more interesting stuff to wear at work or a night out, however, this is not cheap nor boring.', 'I bought this and sprayed it once on my left wrist. For me it is very unique compared to my other 186 Bottles. The Cedar and White Musk are lovely and that Sea Salt vibe is amazing. I am certain that this would work well in winter also.  This scent is very long lasting and will get you compliments, just avoid pouring it on you. Longevity wise, I get at least 12 hours on me.

There arent that many fragrances that use the note, and I happen to really enjoy it, so I have experience with almost all of them. This sits somewhere in between Sel Marin and AdG Essenza, closer to the AdG. It does not have the darker woodiness of Bulgari Aqua, and it is not quite as salty and marine as Sel Marin. It is largely a green and ""wet"" fragrance, and is juicy and round. It almost smells fruity, but isnt sweet, and you can tell that its from the pulp of a fleshy leaf, not a fruit. In my personal opinion, the greens are very tightly bound; you do not get an obvious sharp ""pine"" reference like you would in Polo, or sharp ""juniper"" like in Issey Bleue. They all come together like a bushel of herbs. Very cheap and worth the price. This is a good choice for someone who is just starting out and looking for a unique, non-citrus fragrance for daily wear or as a summer spray. It smells apart from your standard citrus+spice+woody fare, and is definitely unique when compared to your standard calone-fresh brew.

Every time I smell it, it mutates into something else.  I agree with MrMookie about the opening; the first time I sprayed it, for one or two minutes, it was almost aquatic. But now I cannot smell any aquatic vibe in it. Most of the time I find it soapy, kind of similar to Quartz from Molyneux (a perfume I don't particularly like). Also, woodsy and spicy, if you smell it close to skin. But if you smell it at a certain distance, the trail is soapy. Also, it's VERY green, very herbal.  At the same time, the soapiness is a bit balsamic.  So: aquatic, woodsy, balsamic, herbal, spicy??  Plus, at times I think it has a vintage character; other times, I think it belongs to the 2000's.

Totally worth a try!"", ""I love this, gave a bottle of it to my BFF for his birthday this year. He loves it too! Easily one of the crowd pleasers out there. It's just a great quality scent that works for most everyone, nothing wrong with that!"", ""A blind buy inspired by my affection for L'Homme and Avant Garde. However, Alberto Morillas scents have never registered on my radar.  The bright blue colour associated with aqua scents put me off a little. Marine notes are not listed but reviewers are mentioning them on Fragrantica, and it concerned me this is what I'd find. I tried Laroche Horizon (and hated it). Kenzo Homme I love and is a long-time favourite (but I don't perceive it as marine/aquatic). Based on the positive reviews on Fragrantica, having an open mind and a good online offer, I have taken the plunge. First off, Oxygene is a different approach to doing things. What I initially perceived as synthetic I am now of a different mind. I get the resins, herbs and the woods - just not the way I have experienced before. You see, this composition has no citrus and no florals - and that is quite unusual in itself. The opening is clean and bright, but momentarily having a strange almost stale note (like sweaty clothing?) Cassiano noticed it, and I certainly have. Thankfully, it passes soon enough. What remains is a fascinating woody resin. I'm presuming fir - because it isn't obviously cedar. I get artemisia too. However, its the fir that I'm noticing - but not like pine or Christmas tree. (I have to say, the room I applied it 30 minutes earlier smells fab!) An hour on, and I can tell you exactly what this scent reminds me of. This is taking me back to holidays in the Lake District. This reminds me of woodland walks around Ullswater (Howtown, Martindale and Sandwick). Oxygene isn't typical Lanvin. I strongly suspect there is more about it to tease out; after all I've tried it only once. It lies nicely on the skin and is attracting compliments already. Oxygene has proven to be a bit of an inspired choice. An eye opener. Quite simply this scent has got better and better. If I'm not exactly dancing in celebration, I'm none the less impressed. The dancing can wait. I'm just enjoying the moment. This is good!"", 'Now that my allergy to one of the components subsided, I can enjoy Oxygene in all of its synthetic glory. It opens with coriander, hints of resins, some vague floral and overpowering synthetic cypress - which resembles dill. I have checked my spice rack and the actual dried dill smells more complex and woody than this. There are also green aquatic notes in the background. Oxygene does develop and there are moments of brilliance when some woods and resins come to the foreground.  The drydown is less than a skin scent. It would be interesting to see the formula implemented in mostly naturals. Maybe there is a vintage version. As is, Oxygene is a wasted opportunity.', 'Clean, sharp at the beginning comes a little powdery in the base, yet fresh and empowering. As for me, drydown is almost identic as Kenzo Homme, very very similar notes, as well a little synthetic notes as Kenzo. Good price for 100 ml. Mainly a Summer fragrance.', 'Very Clean scent... reminds me of crisp air on a sunny day', ""Alberto Morillas is a genius and Lanvin was so fortunate to acquire his talent creating Oxygene Homme. I don't know why I waited so long to consider such an AMAZING FRAGRANCE. \xa0 After spraying on my skin I could smell the herbal/woodsy notes starting with artemisia, fur and cedar giving it a real attractive green aroma. I also pick up a slight spicy blend from coriander and myrrh. The base notes of cedar and musk gives it a DESIRABLE aroma coming off being very fresh and uplifting.  Longevity and Silage is slightly better than moderate lasting at least 6hrs.  Overall view, I have several Lanvin frag's....Oxygene Homme is one of a few frag's which doesn't have any citrus or floral notes and still across as a real aromatic scent which is perfect during the summer months. The spicy blend increasing the sense of a real masculinity fragrances. Ladies that doesn't mean that you couldn't wear it...I know more women wearing men's fragrance then men wearing women's frag's. There's only one rating that this fragrance deserves...10/10.... ★★★★★ Lastly, to Alberto Morilla....Thank you for your passion and creativity giving all of us PHENOMENAL FRAGRANCES. You are a pillar in the purfume industry."", ""CHEAP SOAP ___________________________________________________________________ The first (and the last, since it doesn't last at all) thing you will notice about Oxygene is that it is powdery. The second one is that it's a cheap smell... but don't worry about it, it doens't last at all so you won't notice it too long. Overall: cheap soap like fragrance Longetivity: - 2/10 Sillage: medium - 1/10 All in all: 1 (bias) out of 10 points."", ""It's... okay. An indifferent scent, not bad. It didn't make much of an impression on me for either good or bad. I guess I like it."", 'Fresh, marine, cool smell. moderating lasting and sillage. greate for beach days in summer!', ""Oxygene Homme is a really refreshing fragrance, best suited to hot Summer days. It's a pleasant blend of crisp wood notes, aromatic herbs and salty seawater. If anything could be described as an aromatic aquatic, Oxygene Homme would be it. I found the female version of Oxygene a bit more characteristic, however that's not to say that Oxygene Homme fades in comparison. It has a nice, clean aroma that will surely appeal to both men and women. The herbaceous accords in Oxygene Homme are so refreshing that they almost clear the sinuses. It acts like Vicks VapoRub without smelling like it. I quite enjoy this clean sharpness. Lanvin fragrances tend to get lost amongst other big name brands, which is a shame seeing that they produce such quality scents. For a man living in an incredibly warm climate, Oxygene Homme would be a God-send. Most impressive is Oxygene Homme's fantastic longevity, not to mention its bold sillage. This fragrance is still relatively easy to find, but I fear that this may not be the case in the next few years. Snap it up if you like it."", 'An extremely peppery frag which is initially strong and very affordable.. I applied 6 heavy sprays 0 - 1.75 hours - 1.25 foot projection. The initial spray is quite modern for a couple of seconds but then the wall of pepper hits you. I see pepper is not listed in the pyramid, but this frag blows your nose of with a similar to black pepper continuos blast. It is ok for a small period, but after 1 hour it becomes tiresome 1.75 hours - 2.5 hours - 1 foot projection. Linear 2.5 hours - 4 hours - 6 inch projection 4 hour - 5 hours - 2 inch projection. At this point the harshness of the pepper gets too much to handle. It reminds me of dated frags which use oakmoss in the drydown 5 hours - 8 .5 hours - close to skin If you love black pepper then this could be your signature frag, but there is hardly anythingelse then that with this frag and so it becomes dull A blind buy, you win some you loose some I prefer to spray on my clothes, it seems to take the edge of the pepper Not for me', ""This bottle was collecting dust on my shelf. I really don't know why i bought it (thought it would be good for office wear), I cant get past the pepper. Almost as if someone dropped a bottle of aqua di gio in a pepper shaker and added some gardenia.

The turquoise color of the perfume is exquisite and the modern design of the bottle too. But there's something that I don't like, and I can't find what it is. Before reading the ingredients, I thought this was a marine/aquatic composition. But what a surprise when I read that this is an herbal/spicy/woody. This is not a bad fragrance, very interesting. But as I said before, sadly something in this perfume, especially in the opening, makes me stay away from it."", ""There is something quite fishy in the opening i thought could be amber gris, but it is not mentioned. Perhaps it is what someone called a dill pickle smell. After that it becomes very comforting and soothing scent, stilll a bit salty. There is also something sweet I cannot identify. As much as I am very fond of cypress and pine can't get any of them. It is a very safe fragrance for very casual wearing,it would be too tranparent if it wasn't for the salty note. Nice herbal scent and very masculine, even though sort of baby like masculinity. Women must love it on their partners."", ""A few days ago I’ve tested Issey Miyake L'Eau Bleue d'Issey Pour Homme and it occurred to me that L'Eau Bleue d'Issey is very similar to my Lanvin Oxygene – spicy, fresh, woody, manly...long lasting and noticeable, but not overpowering - great for summer. So if you want cheaper, but still high quality alternative to more expensive L'Eau Bleue d'Issey and Givenchy pour Homme Blue Label – here it is – Lanvin Oxygene ;)"", ""Curiously, I get dill from this.

Maybe I need to study it harder."", ""I had Bvlgari Aqua Marine on one hand and this in the other. It's like yin-yang. Green vs Blue type of stuff. Opening is a really strong and sharp mint with spicy coriander dominating the woods. 2 h dry down is more pleasant, with fir resin taking over the show. Though oxygene is more of an oxymoron at first. It's like being trapped inside the core production of oxygene. You won't be able to breath in there I can guarantee. This scent might be light and fresh...for a forest!"", ""Nothing is as passe as the recent past. How as a young gun in the nineties we laughed at the excesses of the New Romantics, the absurdities of shoulder pads and overblown ill thought out glamour of the American soap operas of yesteryear. How we disregarded the power play perfumes of that decade of excess. And so: enter the light woods, greens and citruses of the nineties the Isseys the innumerable Calvins and, rather late in the day at the dawn of the new millennium this minor, though far from deplorable, addition to the oeuvre from the venerable house of Lanvin. It announces its already out of dateness with a bottle that appears as though it would be more at home on Jean Luc Picard's Next Generation USS Enterprise than on the shelf of a self-respecting amateur of the perfumery arts.  How strange and old-fashioned the brush aluminium effect device seems and who on earth would make a scent light blue nowadays (take note Gucci). And yet, and yet, whilst Oxygene will never set your great aunts tinder ready wood pile on fire let alone the world it is a workmanlike piece. The accords here are harmonious, the effect more pleasing than inoffensive and the sensation is of comfort and safety more than mere conventionality. This is a spray that will never extract gasps of appreciation or excitement from fragrantly inclined friend but may earn appreciation from old ones and questions from married women looking for something they will be happy to smell of a faithful husband day in day out.  There is role, and not an insubstantial one, for durable, well-made and versatile mixes like Oxygene and available as it is and very reasonable prices I would certainly recommend it as pleasing mood music if nothing more."", 'This perfume reminds me of Burberry Touch for man... its an OK scent ...for the price what you can expect.', 'Too much green scent at the opening but middle and base notes are amazing and last long.', 'Lanvin Oxygen is a very underrated fresh fragrance, As a fact, Lanvin in general is very underrated.

Such a great concept of Lanvin with all the strong green herbals in the opening it starts somehow aquatic but this wil last only 2 minutes!then the middle part arrives super icy-cold but pleasantly fresh.  It remindend me as breazy as Leau de Issey but dont get me wrong i will develop more like L'Eau Bleue d'Issey Pour Homme because of the cypress and juniper stronger greenness When i smell this right now i imagine :  A forest trail hike on a snowy mountaintop on a summer hazy day where the wind blows thin air from the snowtops through the balsamic trees and bushes of artemsia,juniper,cypress,fir and other greens.Its uber masculine. Its almost balsamic menthol freshness for your senses as its will keep you alert throughout the day. The drydown soothes it all with splendid white musk and thankfully not vetiver (as always) This is more for the active outdoor people or to be sharp in office and definitely not a romantic night time fragrance (you need lanvins arpege pour homme then ;-) This almost costs nothing these days?

It kind of reminds me on opening of Echo by Davidoff. I was actually a bit dissapointed by the top notes, but after about 5 minutes it starts to evolve into an airy/aquatic, almost mist or fog scent all the way down to the woody base. The drydown kind of reminds me of He Wood Rocky mountain a little bit, but not as woody. It\'s definitely a light scent so it\'s almost impossible to offend anyone. I put on 6-8 sprays all over my body and still am transparent although I can catch a wiff sometimes, so I know others can too.

This is the first LANVIN product I ever purchased back in 2001 and it is simply incredible. Fresh and crisp, it has a clean smell and not overly floral. Which is odd because I adore florals, but this fragrance spoke to me and I am so glad I purchased it.', 'This scent is very strongly dominated by conipherous resin in a way that, for a person like me who does not really appreciate this type of scent, makes it seem unbalanced. Nevertheless, the first time I wore it, I got complimented more than five hours after appying it (and only on skin), to my surprise, because I thought no one would anyway even notice it, apparently too weak, and in case anyone did, most likely they would not find it pleasant. Well, I was mistaken. It seems that at a distance the scent gets a slight soft sweetness that you do not notice otherwise - must be the musk. And anyway, tastes vary. I have the impression, actually, that there is something special about the scent, and I would need to smell it on another person, which so far I did not. After wearing it quite a few times, I like this perfume better and better and actually find the scent amazingly good, very special and sophisticated, a real gem. What I am not sure about is longevity, althoug sillage is quite good at least at the beginning. I will keep wearing it to see what happens. PS. I have to say that although I wear it now and again, because I have a big bottle and try to see if I manage to like it better, I do not really like this scent. I find the scent of conipherous resin too raw. It does not surprise me that it has been discontinued. Also, staying power seems, after all, and as I already thought, to be none. Alberto Morillas makes marvellous fragrances for women, but in my opinion his fragrances for men are not nearly as good.', 'Just bought it at a bargain price. Very nice fragrance for a reasonable money. Reminds me of Bvlgari Aqua Pour Homme Marine. Will wear it in spring and not too hot summer days. I really like it.', 'I like this a lot and it is great value. It balances freshness and green notes with a gentle woody herbiness, subtle floral-feel notes and clean pepper. It gets more musky later on and smells great throughout. Based on my usual 2 sprays - it projects reasonably well for 4-5 hours and it lasts for 8-10 hours as a skin scent with a tiny bit of projection. It is still just about detectable on skin at 12 hours. Overall it feels like a green-ish, gently woody, masculine aquatic to me. I use it a fair bit as an everyday scent (especially in the spring and summer) and will definitely be buying more.', 'doesnt last at all.

Probably it beats a good number of aquatic/blue scents around there."", 'Excellent and unique fragrance from Alberto Morillas. I purchased it blind, but with confidence after reading notes and knowing who the creator behind this is! I love the depth of Oxygene Homme - this is more than just an ""airy"" scent...way more. I love the refreshing notes of Juniper, Artemisia and Coriander on the top - a nice dash of white pepper, too. The middle and drydown are full of Cypress, Fir, and what can only be described as a blast of fresh air off a snow-covered mountain (not too ozonic - but clean). Wonderful fragrance - the basenotes for me stay very clean, but warm up. They are a touch of white musk with the crisp white pepper (not black pepper, or heavy) in the drydown blended with all the woods.  A must-have for people who want something that can be worn year-round and smell truly fresh - not synthetic. Cool Water and CK lovers can go elsewhere...this is a scent for people who appreciate something more unique and true to its name. Solid 4/5 on scent with a 3/5 longevity (this is a day scent and needs to be reapplied after 4-5 hours or so). Overall - 7.5+/10 and recommended, especially for the very low price.

But it was so ephemeral that in an instant, it became a kind of wet grass smell. YES, that was my 1st impression about this cologne! The evolution continues and the cologne keeps the herbal aspect, very refreshing and a little bit spicy, with a hint of coriander. In some moments, seems like it have pepper in its composition. The Artemisia has its value, for sure! Besides that, it has juniper, myrtle and the fir resin, which gives a fantastic touch to the scent evolution, very well blended to the cypress. I guess this is what I feel most of the time! This cologne keeps a continuous freshness, without needing to be “aquatic” for this. It exhales well, which is very important to me and, yet, stays for a long time on the skin.

Probably it will be praised by the others (untrained noses) for its balanced and nice smell. What I noticed is that the aura is pretty strong and the fragrance can be felt far away.

Great for daywear and it has a light and reasonable sillage.  Sadly, it didn't work for me, as light perfumes completely dissipate on my skin and I need to wear heavier fragrances.

Blue coloured fragrances don't automatically mean that you are holding the ocean in a bottle. It has a nice foresty, earthy, herbal and green character.  What does a forest provide? Exactly, OXYGENE. Standing in a forest surrounded by trees looking up into the sky on a sunny day.....what do I see? Exactly, a BLUE sky full of OXYGEN. Absolutely underrated."", ""Classic. motherfuckers won't understand. but i will. and i will explain to you why. Because of that Cypress. Best cypress ever done. EVER. Legendary fragrance."", ""★★★★ Magnificent. One may think that the name Oxygene can be interpreted as a scent with an aquatic character. What is really interesting is that Oxygene is mainly a herbal & spicy composition with an airy facet. Instead of a watery profile, upon spraying Oxygene you can feel blast of peppery freshness that will slowly transition into a blue hued woody airiness. It's the breeze in a forest, a forest near the sea.  I am reminded of Escada Sport Country Weekend, it has that forest airy character, but the Lanvin creation is more ethereal. It also comes across as a lighter minimalist version of Guy Laroche's Horizon. Amazing and unique, lasts on my skin for 6 hours and keeps a nice soft aura around me, perfect for the warm days of the Greek summer! Severely underrated, this is one of Morillas' masterpieces!"", ""Got it today! Such a great concept of Lanvin with all the strong green herbals in the opening it starts somehow aquatic but this wil last only 2 minutes!then the middle part arrives super icy-cold but pleasantly fresh.  It remindend me as breazy as Leau de Issey but dont get me wrong i will develop more like L'Eau Bleue d'Issey Pour Homme because of the cypress and juniper stronger greenness When i smell this right now i imagine :  A forest trail hike on a snowy mountaintop on a summer hazy day where the wind blows thin air from the snowtops through the balsamic trees and bushes of artemsia,juniper,cypress,fir and other greens.Its uber masculine. Its almost balsamic menthol freshness for your senses as its will keep you alert throughout the day. The drydown soothes it all with splendid white musk and thankfully not vetiver (as always) This is more for the active outdoor people or to be sharp in office and definitely not a romantic night time fragrance (you need lanvins arpege pour homme then ;-) This almost costs nothing these days? All lanvins i got where cheap too bad for such a great house~they deserve better!"", 'I was excited to try this and in some ways am not disappointed. The combination of herbs and coniferous trees is so relaxing and fresh. There is no sweetness in this one, so it all comes across as quite natural rather than ""cologney"". It is not an aquatic at all- I think the color of the juice is coloring opinions here. I can\'t see this offending a soul. Aaaand...that\'s the other story. Mr Morillas\'s sometimes achilles heel rears its head again: low performance. A few sprays lasted on my skin overnight, I can still smell it in the morning, but the projection is so very light. But as I think of it, a composition like this is perhaps meant to be ephemeral, especially considering its herbal heart. If it projected strongly, I think it would smell like a caricature of itself and become either cloying or obnoxious. Oxygene is the perfect name for a fragrance like this: imagine being in a forest on a dry summer day, a gentle breeze occasionally carries the aromatic scent of a mixture of trees, alpine flowers and herbs to your nose, as if reminding us that Nature\'s perfume is more exquisite than anything created in a laboratory.', ""I don't know what to make of this one.  Every time I smell it, it mutates into something else.  I agree with MrMookie about the opening; the first time I sprayed it, for one or two minutes, it was almost aquatic. But now I cannot smell any aquatic vibe in it. Most of the time I find it soapy, kind of similar to Quartz from Molyneux (a perfume I don't particularly like). Also, woodsy and spicy, if you smell it close to skin. But if you smell it at a certain distance, the trail is soapy. Also, it's VERY green, very herbal.  At the same time, the soapiness is a bit balsamic.  So: aquatic, woodsy, balsamic, herbal, spicy??  Plus, at times I think it has a vintage character; other times, I think it belongs to the 2000's. So, completely lost regarding this one."", ""What can I say about Oxygene Homme that has not been said yet? I'm not a fan of this fragrance. I'm gonna keep this short and sweet, The presentation is great, the atomizer could be better but it works just fine.  The juice I got is like a wintergreen mint color, not blue like I see in most pictures. The opening is very sharp, earthy and salty. If you ever got a face full of grass and dirt and maybe a little of your own blood on a pouring day while playing football with your buddies, this is exactly the smell I get. that first minute is INTENSE to my nose.  after that first minute, the smell eases up and becomes a wet forest scent, pine needles, cypress, cedar and wet dew. like soaking wet, as if you emerged from a cave into the forest after the monsoon storm has passed. Now here is where it gets a touch interesting, the scent smells like a earthier version of Pino Silvestre Original for the next 20 minutes. but wait, this particular fragrance DNA mutates into a psuedo Pino Silvestre Original / Polo Blue combo, leaving your skin with a touch of pine and aquatics. The scent last on my skin for about an hour and dissipates into nothingness.  Not a fan of this rollercoaster. The scent at the end of its life reminds me of Polo Blue's drydown. It's not bad but its weak in comparison."", ""Quality *** Versatility **** Durability ** Sillage *** Top *** Heart ** Base ** Final score *** Minireview from a partial wearing, I don't like nor dislike it, not much else to say about it."", ""I've had Oxygene quite for a few years, I think I bought it in a discount store. The turquoise color of the perfume is exquisite and the modern design of the bottle too. But there's something that I don't like, and I can't find what it is. Before reading the ingredients, I thought this was a marine/aquatic composition. But what a surprise when I read that this is an herbal/spicy/woody. This is not a bad fragrance, very interesting. But as I said before, sadly something in this perfume, especially in the opening, makes me stay away from it."", ""Curiously, I get dill from this. And lots of it. Dill? Seriously?

Here it's more aquatic and more about citrus - the way I read remember the OG actually. It's quite surprising to me because before comparing the two I never considered Declaration to be as spicy as it is with cumin, coriander and cardamom.  So in a way maybe this is closer to Rodriguez Bleu Noir which is kind of a simplified version of OG Declaration."", 'Lemon petitgrain cardamom vetiver  Those who have read my review of the EDT know that Declaration is in my eyes a milestone of 90s masculine perfumery, allowing for a departure from the coumarinic fougeres aka drakkar noir and paving the way for abstract compositions like TdH. Essence is however quite different, the spicy facets are to my nose more subdued and act as a transition between a lemon petitgrain top and vetiver sandalwood dry down. Petitgrain isn’t listed but to my nose dominates the formulation, bitter green lemony facets in the top however with an ample raunchy terpinic gooey sappy green facet. This ties nicely into the vetiver with ground Indian spices we already know from the original. The result is interesting, essence is significantly less refreshing and more sticky, less so the bitter spicy refreshment of the edt, and much more concentrated green woody spice and vetiver. There are times where I am reminded a bit of Thai cooking, in the the tart lemon facets blend with the spice almost like a ginger and lemongrass combo. I find the dry down a bit of a pet down though, more creamy milky coumarinic facets mixing in and evoking somewhat classic fougere structure. Interesting journey, great execution, but ultimately not the direction I was looking for.', 'My lord!

Probably so, but I find Declaration Essence to be an interesting, natural, herbaceous, complex and elegant composition.  Blending is first class and this is one of my favourite vetiver-combos ever.  The notes project stronger than in the original Declaration EDT, especially the prominent vetiver, which is why I like it a lot.The tea-note adds a special touch. Performance is better as well, though, the EDT is fresher overall. Projects a polished, intense, aromatic, invigorating, distinctly accomplished and masculine personality; very versatile and perfect for office and social occasions. If TDH is professional, DE is distinguished. I like them both.  This is one classy and stylish scent, and like TDH, signature worthy. I don't get any BO at all, it's just zingy. For anyone who doesn't have this issue either, this ought to be a top-shelf recommendation. I prefer DE over many, including more expensive scents.

Have some test bottles on stock but still a shame it's officially gone."", ""@Asturiias I stopped taking what Fragrantica says as gospel when I saw that for Gentleman EDP, the note of Iris wasn't listed.

Printing on the back of the store tester says similarly. Déclaration\'s usual spice-cedar structure with a clear touch of labdanum are apparent in this flanker. And yet there\'s totally no cedar, cardamom nor labdanum in Fragrantica\'s note table. Notes for this one seem all over the place, depending on who you ask or where you look. Selfridges says ""Bergamot, Bitter Orange, Cistus, Pepper, Cardamom, Cedar Wood, Vetiver, Oak Moss."" At least that is closer to what the fragrance actually smells like.

From the atomizer (which is tacky but very high quality) to the juice and notes used, this screams a freshy that takes itself very, very seriously! There is no playfulness in this, this is a freshy still, but not in a gym scent kind of way, this is a freshy in a gentlemanly dressed up type of way. The moment you spray this, you will notice how great the atomizer is, and then you will be hit by a very spicy opening, for some reason, being this spicy does not really suit all age groups in my opinion, and the opening can be a bit too much if you ask me. The tea note in the opening can be dialed down a little bit, and I agree with BOish kind of vibe this can give especially if mixed with a little bit of sweat. This is not very unisex in my opinion, it is very manly and seductive, not easy to pull off especially if you are a younger guy, and if a fragrance can evoke a picture in my mind, this for some reason smells like a grey tux on a gentleman. If you like the Sauvages and the blues, do not get this, and generally do not get this as a blind buy. Longevity is kind of meh too, performance in general is average."", ""Super spicy , sort of rough opening. Once you let it go for an hour it dries down to a slightly smokier version of the original.

If you like it then you will enjoy it and maybe another person who is sitting/standing very close to you. I think this is a perfect scent for mid-spring day time."", ""Very special. My first impression is WOOD. But it's enveloped in something fresh. Old school cologne vibe. Dry citrus towards Guerlain L'Boisee. High class masculine. Not modern, retro smell from 90s. Green with a mint type feeling in the top.  This is a bit challenging, not a typical run off the mill freshie. This I can see as a polarising scent that young people don't dare to go near. Myself I can't decide if I love this or if it is too old smelling for my taste. What I do love about it, it's DRY and stands for it.

The citrus top is out, and spices are toned down. It's all about resins, leather and cardamom, with a hint of incense. I see the original as a tribute to Eau d'Hermes, the Essence as a minor woody twist, the Parfum as a resinous leather flanker more distant than the other two. My preference goes to the original, with Essence as a close runner-up (these two would be hard to differentiate in blind test, tbh, for how similar they are one from the other)."", ""Declaration Essence from Cartier is quite unique to my nose.  I could smell tea, vetiver, and sandalwood. Tea note in the opening vanishes early and quickly. Vetiver to my nose is rather a top/middle note than base; it is barely noticeble but persistent throughout. Sandalwood also shows up early and is louder than vetiver. Declaration Essence also has a BBQ smell that I couldn't figure out. I wanted to like it, but my nose and brain kept on telling me it smelled like floral cedar flavored BBQ sauce.  Then, cumin shows up in the base. Declaration Essence has then been transformed from floral-cedar-BBQ sauce to floral-cedar-masked sweaty armpits in a BBQ kitchen.

To nutshell it for you, if you like the original Cartier Declaration EDT but want something with a little more vetiver, musk and citrus kick then grab a bottle of Cartier Declaration Essence EDT and you will be happy wearing it for the Spring, Summer and Fall.

Its a light , uplifting and amazing scent. Sure not the best performance ... I get about 5 to 6 hours of longevity with moderate sillage.', ""Declaration Essence Cologne is a rather curious perfume in that it has poor sillage yet a quite determined longevity. It's a skin scent about half an hour in. After about six hours you have to go hunting for it on your own body to find it but it hangs in doggedly in traces and elements for ten hours and beyond.  It opens with geranium, lavender, tea and a vague feel of citrus. Two and a half hours later the smell is the same but with the addition of the orange blossom and lemon. It remains that way but getting progressively weaker. I don't get any sandalwood or vetiver. I just get a rather dull, bland freshy.  The vibe reminds me of YSL Cologne Gingembre and Chanel's Platinum Egoiste. It's all just a bit office safe, not wanting to stand out or make a statement. I don't object to the smell but it's as exciting as wallpaper paste. It certainly doesn't smell like the original Declaration and it certainly doesn't have the flair of Declaration Cologne or the presence of Declaration D'Un Soir.

It is not often I run into a fragrance like that, making me pause to consider how I would personally rate it... There is something about the way the Tea note plays its part in the opening of this fragrance. It is a little too piercing and dirty smelling right at first... I am so glad it settled down though, because that was killing the fragrance for me! Once it settles down, boy does this fragrance really start coming together and becomes quite balanced. It reminds me a lot of Tous The Origin 1920, at least the way the tea and citruses play together. The bases are where they differ, Declaration Essence seems to go in a clean Vetiver and slightly less cloying direction, while The Origin is more of a clean Patchouli that projects a bit more. Ultimately, a well put together fragrance that I would say is pretty Office safe. Doesnt scream out at folks, but it is also noticeable at times. Interesting sprayer design as well... BOTH are recommended frags :).', 'Cartier Declaration Essence EDT opens with a moderate projection of citrus, floral, and sharp green notes. The opening is mature, elegant, intense, classy, and versatile. The vetiver, tea, orange blossom, lavender, and lemon are the opening noticeable notes. The vetiver is by far the most prominent note, it comes across a freshly cut grass, dry, green herbaceous, earthy, pure, fresh, intense, and sharp. One step behind is the tea which supplements the greenness of the vetiver with a slightly sweet, green, and herbaceous note. The flowers, sandalwood, and musk are two steps behind and work as support notes, the lavender adds a soft clean-like, purple floral accord; the geranium a sweet, warm, lemony, and green note; the orange blossom is a white floral with a citrus touch. The sandalwood and musk are faint notes in the back of the fragrance, they contribute with a pinch of sweetness and a musky earthy note. The opening to dry down transition is relatively linear, the lemon is noticeable during the opening but just for a brief moment, then the notes of the fragrance line up as described earlier and continue into the dry down. Once Cartier Declaration Essence EDT has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a moderate projection, intense green vetiver, tea, sandalwood, white-purple floral, and musky fragrance. The fragrance feels bold, casual, classy, cold, dated, dry, earthy, elegant, exotic, expensive, formal, fresh, grassy, green harsh, high-quality, intense, invigorating, masculine, mature, musky, natural, nicely-blended, office-ready, persistent, professional, pure, refreshing, rich, sharp, slightly sweet, versatile, white, zesty, and pleasant.

Ever since, I've avoided all its flankers at duty free, not wanting to endure a long haul flight testing a scent that had earned an ambiguous reputation with me. Wolfgang Mazrin describes a similar experience with Essence as I had with the original - that body chemistry interaction is noticeably a real determiner of how one gets on with either. Having read selectively about 'Essence' here and elsewhere, and discovering a good online offer, I've taken the plunge once again with this Machiavellian wonder. The good news is this flanker works for me when original Déclaration didn't quite. Bbjr (Dec 24 2018) reflects my thinking in that the toned-down citrus solves the cloying problem. If the lime gives Essence a sweaty, virile, body odour 'pheromonal' post-coital redolence; it's the addition of lemon that cleans it up so that it's edgy but safe. Déclaration Essence gets it 'right'. The subtly smoky tea and vetiver really works for me. Combined with the lime and amber there's a brooding atmosphere that evokes hot and steamy tropical Indian subcontinent hillsides. Like tea plantations, with their sweaty tea pickers battling the humidity and heat of the afternoon. Trying it, leaving it, returning to it, I'm perplexed how I really can't seem to pick out any of the florals. All I get is citrus and woods from beginning to end. Strangely, I want to believe there's cardamom in there somewhere. (It isn't.) A curious semblance persists though. Déclaration Essence is a beautifully crafted scent with respectable longevity and projection. It couldn't possibly matter which side one's preferences fall - original or Essence - the drydown of each is so similar. Essence gets my vote: a purely personal view on what are subtle differences between two awesome creations. Essence takes the best of the original whilst taming its challenging aspects. A good scent has attained true greatness."", ""I just purchased a full bottle of this and received a compliment on the first day. For some reason, this fragrance reminds me of Terre D' Hermes.

In Malaysia this gem is also not mass marketed, and Cartier is more well known for their jewelry product than perfume. Upon first spray, I was shocked. This smell very nasty!

The vanilla smudges the edges of the tart citrus, smoothing out a scent that is otherwise quite sour and bracing. I prefer this to the original.

Essence is just lighter on spices, mainly on cumin and cardamom. It\'s also a little more citrusy.

It\'s not ""in your face"" as regular, which makes it more wearable in summer. But it still can\'t be named as a typical fresh fragrance. It\'s like a more polite version of Declaration.  I heard that it lasts longer than its predecessor and is a stronger version of Declaration. Well, to me both things are straight opposite. I can\'t say I dislike it, but classic is a classic.

Very soon, though the wood seems to disappear and is replaced by very sharp, sweet, peppery smoke. And that is why this fragrance is a barbecue, or maybe a campfire. No, not *exactly* in every note, but to me it seems so obvious...standing there by the fire while the mesquite wood burns. That being said, back to the clear liquid in the vial: it\'s still sweet, sharp and peppery, and feels very incomplete, like a Demeter fragrance. ""Backyard Barbecue"". I think there\'s some sandalwood, and probably some believable incense, but I just can\'t make any association at all beyond Barbecue. If I could take this seriously as a personal fragrance for use in scenting my person, I would first of all debate whether it\'s too piercing; the sharpness, the direct and harsh sweetness, and the pepper might stab at other people\'s noses, even though it\'s not an overall ""powerhouse"" onslaught. I also don\'t see it as a room spray, because it\'s too close to the smell that I want to get off my clothes and hair when I come home after barbecue or a campfire.

After about ten minutes, though, it settles down to somewhere in between spicy tea and a winter forest. Towards the end of the day, it smells soft and floral with a hint of lime.

Generally, Cartier ""Declaration Essence"" is rather a stronger fragrance than a soft fragrance and I suggest to use it during summer and fall rather than during winter and spring. In summer this one might turn out to be the perfect fragrance for hot days and vacations. Smelling this fragrance I have to think of a wealthy and sophisticated type of man who\'s wearing a polo-shirt and reading a book while sitting in the shadow on a hot summer day.  I do get the tea, vetiver and geranium ingredients in the top with a soft orange blossom in the base.

The opening is mature, elegant, intense, classy, and versatile. The vetiver, tea, orange blossom, lavender, and lemon are the opening noticeable notes. The vetiver is by far the most prominent note, it comes across a freshly cut grass, dry, green herbaceous, earthy, pure, fresh, intense, and sharp. One step behind is the tea which supplements the greenness of the vetiver with a slightly sweet, green, and herbaceous note. The flowers, sandalwood, and musk are two steps behind and work as support notes, the lavender adds a soft clean-like, purple floral accord; the geranium a sweet, warm, lemony, and green note; the orange blossom is a white floral with a citrus touch. The sandalwood and musk are faint notes in the back of the fragrance, they contribute with a pinch of sweetness and a musky earthy note. The opening to dry down transition is relatively linear, the lemon is noticeable during the opening but just for a brief moment, then the notes of the fragrance line up as described earlier and continue into the dry down. Once Cartier Declaration Essence EDT has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a moderate projection, intense green vetiver, tea, sandalwood, white-purple floral, and musky fragrance. The fragrance feels bold, casual, classy, cold, dated, dry, earthy, elegant, exotic, expensive, formal, fresh, grassy, green harsh, high-quality, intense, invigorating, masculine, mature, musky, natural, nicely-blended, office-ready, persistent, professional, pure, refreshing, rich, sharp, slightly sweet, versatile, white, zesty, and pleasant.

Ever since, I've avoided all its flankers at duty free, not wanting to endure a long haul flight testing a scent that had earned an ambiguous reputation with me. Wolfgang Mazrin describes a similar experience with Essence as I had with the original - that body chemistry interaction is noticeably a real determiner of how one gets on with either. Having read selectively about 'Essence' here and elsewhere, and discovering a good online offer, I've taken the plunge once again with this Machiavellian wonder. The good news is this flanker works for me when original Déclaration didn't quite. Bbjr (Dec 24 2018) reflects my thinking in that the toned-down citrus solves the cloying problem. If the lime gives Essence a sweaty, virile, body odour 'pheromonal' post-coital redolence; it's the addition of lemon that cleans it up so that it's edgy but safe. Déclaration Essence gets it 'right'. The subtly smoky tea and vetiver really works for me. Combined with the lime and amber there's a brooding atmosphere that evokes hot and steamy tropical Indian subcontinent hillsides. Like tea plantations, with their sweaty tea pickers battling the humidity and heat of the afternoon. Trying it, leaving it, returning to it, I'm perplexed how I really can't seem to pick out any of the florals. All I get is citrus and woods from beginning to end. Strangely, I want to believe there's cardamom in there somewhere. (It isn't.) A curious semblance persists though. Déclaration Essence is a beautifully crafted scent with respectable longevity and projection. It couldn't possibly matter which side one's preferences fall - original or Essence - the drydown of each is so similar.

Printing on the back of the store tester says similarly. Déclaration\'s usual spice-cedar structure with a clear touch of labdanum are apparent in this flanker. And yet there\'s totally no cedar, cardamom nor labdanum in Fragrantica\'s note table. Notes for this one seem all over the place, depending on who you ask or where you look. Selfridges says ""Bergamot, Bitter Orange, Cistus, Pepper, Cardamom, Cedar Wood, Vetiver, Oak Moss."" At least that is closer to what the fragrance actually smells like. Nonetheless, hasn\'t stopped countless reviewers before me from miraculously smelling lavender or geranium in this due to Fragrantica\'s error.', 'It smells like you showered at a hotel (and used hotel bar soap) then hung out by a campfire. There\'s quite a bit of ""smoky"" and some indistinct spices in this, but not much to counterbalance. I can\'t detect citrus, though there is some kind of sweet fruit smell. I don\'t think the sweet and the smoke work well together.', 'The initial scent is of a very fresh, very pleasant, slightly unusual, but unusual in a nice way spicy aromatic, woody, citrus. It’s smells like a scent you could really like, but after wearing it for two hours the scent was almost undetectable on my skin. This scent would probably work well as a light, inoffensive, but kind of nice, daily work perfume. For me it’s too faint, too subtle, and it doesn’t have the wow factor that I’m looking for in my scents. Yes, the initial blast is very nice, but the scent doesn’t last long enough, so I won’t be investing in a full bottle of the perfume.', 'I do not like the opening of this fragrance. I do not like the lavender, flower, musky mix of notes which makes this kind of synthetic and gives me a headache after an hour. The It is to smoky and earthy during the middle notes, which makes me gag. The spices mixed in with the other notes make this forgetable. Overall a 5/10.', ""Apparently this frag needs to work well with your body chemistry for it to smell decent.  On me, it smells somewhere between mosquito repellant and a dry rub for souvlaki. Only when wearing in the wide outdoors does it smell slightly palatable, but that's not good enough for me to keep around. I'm exchanging this one through scentbox.""]"

Nothing much to say here that hasn't been said. A classic fresh clean green scent much like the OG. A tad more green and less aquatic.  This is very much in your classic masculine scents. Not overly agressive, definitely mass appealing (bought it at walmart way back). I wore swiss army yesterday and would swear I'm wearing the same thing today...I'm sure comparison would yield similarities.

Bought it when it was released and thought I smelled like the sexiest man alive. Not so much any more. I had this, ADG, chrome, polo sport, and Burberry in rotation. I gave this away to a local donation store (ReTails) in 2017 since I couldn’t reach for it any more. Great if you don’t have a lot to turn to, but it smells dated to me, even though it is an appealing scent to the ladies. Projection is crazy especially in the summer. Go easy. Longevity was good, and I’d say high school to 30’s can rock it. Not a manly mans scent. Very sweet. Too sweet for me these days and I love sweet juices. Evening and night time wear, day time it might be too strong unless it’s fall or winter.. Overall it takes me back, but I won’t be buying again. Not worth the mula, unless you really like it.

Very Sexy is safe and a good choice for wearing at work. The scent is pleasant and women like it. I wore this at the office for quite some time and the girls there seem to enjoyed it, I was always receiving compliments for it. The only bad thing about Very Sexy is longevity as said before, it fades away too quick, maybe 2-4 hours max. I used to re-apply this 2 times a day during my 8 hr shift.

I have gotten more compliments when I wear this, than when I wear Mona d'Orio, Tom Ford, or Creed. Definately a hit with women. Drawbacks are Poor longevity, less than 5hrs, and only fair sillage after dry-down.

Discovered this fragrance from a older gentleman collection around age45 he didn't have many others but I had to gone out and get my own bottle within that week.

I dunno what happened recently, it\'s definitely a recent development of the community that\'s spread like wildfire. I\'ve always understood what that\'s supposed to do. It\'s worked before, but I couldn\'t be arsed by something that obviously smelt like fly spray at the time. No I wasn\'t sniffing toxic sprays at the time, I\'m extremely sensitive to that shit. With maceration it\'s also up to your sense of smell to take some time out and revisit a particular frag, not ""just"" whatever bottle you think needs some time out for being a naughty lil child while you forget about it for a while. Sometimes it\'s YOU that\'s the problem. Yeah I know what nose blindness is, I\'ve experienced that before, but there\'s more to our physiology than just overused community terms. Because we change all the time. Fact is no way Mambo is all that masculine let alone that great of a bottle. Even Curve and Curve Crush smelt similar to my Mambo bottle. Insect repellant..! I can\'t be wasting my time on ""nice"" springy scents anymore because they don\'t ever promise nor deliver every time. They\'re Cadbury chocolate in the world of artisan made. I already have a bunch of favourites for that time of year, and for many years thus far. I wouldn\'t pay for it again to be proven wrong, but testing this is a no because it\'s not in the shops.

I remember I got it when it was new, put it on, got a big bucket of popcorn and watched Super Troopers in the movie theater.

It's a fresher, fruitier, springier cousin of Mambo.  I had a bottle of Curve, there's notes of that in all of these scents, but I gave it away. I kept my Mambo 3.4 Oz from 2002, then grew tired of it for some reason, made it halfway through than got rid of it for some reason.

It smells like Christmas, but in a way that is vague and can still be worn year-round and surprisingly works as a summer fragrance. The drydown is relatively quick and is mostly musk, patchouli and then sandalwood. I feel the notes listed are accurate, but the ones I listed above seem the most prominent to me. The warmth and depth of the drydown is comparable to Calvin Klein Obsession, but instead of sweetness, it’s more woody but still has a very similar musk. The release date surprised me because this smells more like a late 80’s to 90’s fragrance to me in some ways. Probably would suggest for an older man. Unfortunately since it is a cologne, it’s very weak and only really sticks to the skin for a few hours, but for the price it can be reapplied as many times as needed.

Are they right? - is the fragrance a sex magnet? Does it draw attention? Maybe. It’s a nice scent, spicy wood top notes, with a lush dry down which is where you get the musky-florals.

That said, I’ve not smelled anything like Mambo before, and as it definitely feels a summer/balmy weather scent, I think it’ll be my day-to-day ‘to go’ over the coming months. Great price for the 100ml bottle.', ""The year is 2000. I'm 15. Went to the movies with the crew. Seen a group of girls and stepped to them. One of the girls say you smell so good boy. We all went to the same movie. She sat with me and said I still smell like she could eat me. Let's just say... I didn't wash my hands for the rest of the night lol. In all seriousness, women loved this. Grown women said I smelled good. Even one of my teachers asked what I was wearing to get it for her husband. I didn't know about notes then and take don't care for them now. This worked back then. My nose now is to refined to go back but great memories."", ""I used to go to this place Scores in New York City back in the day and every time I left I would be covered in this stuff.

Yeah, it\'s nothing groundbreaking, not ""smart"", but who cares? It\'s hot! It\'s like a Himbo in a bottle. And underneath the artificial exterior, you find a genuine warmth that\'s hard to resist.  Speaking of artificial.... The opening is SUPER synthetic, and if it wasn\'t there, this frag would get heavy use from me. Still, the scent underneath is very very pleasant! I find it interesting that so many are calling it a musk/patchouli bomb, because I really cant stand either of those notes. To me, I mostly get a warm, inviting, sweet sweet cinnamon. It\'s playful, it\'s friendly, it\'s warm.  For the cost, you have nothing to lose by trying it. Take it out for a night on the town and tell me you don\'t feel suave!', 'A very musky masculine cologne. Patchouli bomb. Purchased as a blind buy back in 2015, and my bottle is still 95% or more full. Primary notes in order are Musk, Patchouli, Verbena, Balsam Fir, Orange Blossom, Lime and Caraway. Definitely a scent more for the older guy. Very abrasive, ""in-your-face"", and tough smelling. Picture a guy in his 60s with the hairy chest and the half down button up rocking a gold chain, smoking a cigar and sipping whiskey on the rocks. As far on the masculine scale as you can go. I would almost say it reminds me of Polo Green but replace the Pine with the Balsam Fir and up the Caraway, Citrus and Patchouli. Longevity is fair at about 6 to 8 hours, sillage is strong.

Great scent for the workplace, business meetings, or even traveling. This is a workhorse. It's 'on duty' until I clock out at the end of my day. I enjoy fougeres very much.

I tried it right after trying Boucheron Pour Homme, and there are similarities as they are both fougeres. Despite all the citrus top notes, Mambo seemed warmer, spicier, and less fresh than you would expect. Mambo seems fairly well-blended (no chemical phases) although perhaps not quite as smooth as Boucheron. On the other hand, Mambo has clearer morphs while Boucheron is more static than linear (which is a great thing if you love Boucheron's opening like I do). Mambo is less youthful, for sure, and more provocative. Mambo didn't strike me as too strong, but you will get noticed. I think it's a good balance between sweet and aromatic, neither desert-like nor bitter with strong wood. Nice for a date."", 'Women LOVE This Frag!!!!!

Curve, Bora Bora, and Mambo share the same DNA, but this one has an 80s vibe to it somehow, like some light elements of a barbershop. I get a bit of pencil shavings in there too. The bottle design and the scent do feel like it could skew feminine’s or unisex. However, I think it can just as well come across as a pleasant-yet-masculine retro scent. This is a cheapie but unlike many of it’s other inexpensive peers, there’s no crude or scratchy drydown.  CONCLUSION: This is a fun and pleasant scent. I like it, but I don't think it's as good as the other Clairborne scent, Curve for Men. But it's a nice variation of that formula.  7/10"", ""I know I grossly overrate this one. My first bottle was in high school when it was new. So, there's nostalgia. Also, my daughter picked this out of my collection as the one she liked because 'it smells like you'. So, there's that.

It is well worth the low price."", ""It's too light and unmasculine, even the box and the shape of the bottle is so feminine.. I hate it."", ""Mambo to me is the Pabst Blue Ribbon of cologne. Yeah it's cheap, it's certainly not the best in it's class, and it has an old school vibe. The opening is a bit harsh with the alcohol but I mean what can you expect from a sub $20 EDC cheapie. Don't let the EDC concentration fool you. While not a projection or longevity beast it holds its own for a good 5-6 hours which is more than I can say for some EDP or EDT concentrations. After the heavy synthetic opening subsides and it starts to dry down you get a mildly spicy and creamy barbershop type scent consistent with many 90s fougeres. It's not as loud as many of those in that category but to me that is a good thing. It makes this very approachable and an easy spray for work as I know I will smell clean and not offend.

With a name like ""Mambo"" I expected a strong spicy fire of a fragrance but what we get instead is just an average scent.  Mambo Cologne for men is a light spicy scent that maintains a slightly less than average sillage and longevity.

It reminds me of Adidas Moves, Swiss Army original, Swiss Army Altitude all in one. I bought a travel spray for 5$ so I'm not concerned. It's a good gym fragrance, or work fragrance (unless you wear a suit), not offensive and very easy to wear. Casual and nice."", ""I originally purchased Mambo thinking it would be a Tropical/Caribbean kind of scent. However, it's nothing of the sort. It's just a clean lavender fragrance, smells like freshly washed clothes mixed with citrus and some kind of woody scent, sandalwood maybe. The longevity on skin is horrible. I get less than an hour and it's completely gone. Projection is 20-30 minutes. I did get much better performance by spraying my shirt. So it appears Mambo is one of those fragrances that works best by spraying your clothing. For $12 I can't complain, but rarely reach for this except maybe once a year during the summer."", 'For those who have not smelled this fragrance. This fragrance is very similar to the original Curve for men. Compared to Curve by Liz Claiborne. Mambo has more spices and is a little richer. Think of Mambo as a evening/night version of Curve.

Considering the price for this fragrance. I give Mambo a 7.5/10. Worth the money!', ""This is a decent fragrance. Pleasant to the nose as most Liz Claiborne fragrances are. It's a soapy, fruity, spicy, aftershave type of scent. In the same vein as Bora Bora or Curve as you would imagine. It's a little lighter than I like but very pleasant to the nose and original. This is something I would picture on a Limo driver or possibly a security card in a nice suit and handlebar mustache. It's classy enough to be worn by someone in the entertainment industry.

I usually don\'t like the term to class things as barbershop because it seems to be overly used for anything with a little lavender and spice. Kind of in the same way that ""just like Le Male"" gets overly used for anything with lavender, vanilla and cinnamon. This is a more subtle fragrance than English Laundry. In it\'s own way it is kinda like your grandpa standing in front of the mirror peeling that last bit of shaving creme from his face with Gillette safety razor and smelling clean. Yet it remains classy enough to wear as a formal fragrance. Longevity is good, projection is rather close and personal in my experience. It\'s not going to offend anyone when you walk into a room. I have to say it is a well blended fragrance, while able to sense most of the individual ingredients, there is nothing that sticks out to say it is too top heavy on any one ingredient. First spray give a bit of vodka or grain alcohol type of scent... not very becoming in its launch from the gate. But that dissipates rather quickly and you get a fair amount of citrus, lavender, and Balsam fir... later comes through with some cinnamon, musk, rose... and finally it really settles in to a soft woody, balsam with hints of cinnamon and sandalwood.

As a bargain scent, we weren\'t expecting much for longevity and quality. I was surprised that it lasts easily for 10-12 hours.  Mambo has a sort of soapy, clean scent mixed with spice and woods. The spice is not overwhelming. The florals, spice, and woody notes are mixed well enough to feel more expensive than its $7 price point. The citrus lifts it up enough to keep the clean feeling going in the midst of so much. It really does have that ""barbershop"" type of smell others have mentioned.

It just didn\'t go far enough in a direction that interested me (gourmand, oriental, incense, etc.), so I rarely wore it. I wore it yesterday for the first time in perhaps three years (or more). This time I detected a mild fougere element as well as a bit of dihydromyrcenol, or something with a similar ""fresh"" effect. There\'s also a fruity quality that lasts a long time. Otherwise the rest of the notes were difficult to detect, other than what I\'m guessing was a pine and lily of the valley accord that had a ""structural"" quality. Recently someone on BN said that women loved it, which is something that has been said about Sauvage, over and over again, and so I wonder who these women are, exactly. I\'d rather wear Carlo Corinto Rouge than either of these, by a wide margin - it\'s also got it\'s share of dihydromyrcenol, as well as possessing a clear fougere accord, but I find it to be a very good composition, quite enjoyable. Mambo is okay but I am just not a fan of the fruity quality, as it seems to lack dynamism and there isn\'t enough contrast. However, I could wear it once in a while for variety, but I already have so many bottles that variety is not really an issue at this point.

Mambo is one of the strongest and most distinctive rhythms in Afro-Caribbean music, but this scent barely makes it past bland --- much more Muzak than Mambo.

Mambo is not a thick, dark spice as the name might imply, but conveys more the image of a well-dressed gent enjoying a warm summer evening.

Great scent, great value... clearly a worthy purchase"", 'what a cologne what performance what a price, always will be in my closet and in my heart, unsung rockstar', 'Perhaps the ""Mambo"" name uses the power of suggestion, but when I sniff this or even think about it, I envision a Cuban cantina with wooden floors and dimmed red lights. Music is playing, but the atmosphere is still somewhat somber. Yet, there\'s a ambiance centered on beautiful dark skinned, curly haired Latina in a crimson red dress dancing with a gentleman in his mid 40s. He\'s wearing a brown fedora hat and a white guayabera, paired with black slacks and fine leather loafers. His charisma is undeniable and he\'s also quite charming, it seems. They dance on a continuous loop in my mind, and each time with the same elated grins. I\'m not sure why I associate this thought with Mambo.  Anyway, I was a freshman in high school in 2003 and one of my best friends, who happened to be a twin, wore this religiously. It seemed that everyone within his milieu enjoyed the scent, especially all the females. I must admit that even I enjoyed his chemistry with it. It just seemed to dance around your nose in a delicate way. It was musky yet soft, warm yet fresh, robust yet subtle. It was a complete anomaly for me at the time, considering the fragrances I was accustomed to were Curve, Tommy, Chrome, etc.. But Mambo stood out. It was unconventional without trying to be pretentious.  I could never understand the properties of this scent. On my skin it\'s spicy, masculine, and mature. Musk is the primary structure of Mambo, but an integration of marginally creamy sandalwood and soft cedar tame the composition. The citrus heavy top eventually navigates itself into the base escorted by redolent lavender. Cinnamon then conceives the warm nuances encompassing the aforementioned, naturally within a synthetic context. Essentially, Mambo echoes the decadence of the archetypal masculine perfumes of the 80s and early 90s. However, it does so uniquely and coherently. I haven\'t worn Mambo in years and I couldn\'t tell you if it\'s been reformulated, but I remembered it lasted at least 8 hours and created an excellent scent bubble. Even my buddy always left a scent trail. My days with Mambo are likely parted, but I still highly recommend it to anyone.', 'I have a thing for collecting mens fragrances, dont ask why but I like this one it has kind of an aftershave/soapy smell that i like makes me think of someone who goes to church in a good way!', 'Lets say you are someone like myself who wore this long ago, or currently wear it.

It was given to me as a gift in 8th grade and I wore it through many cold Michigan winters until High School. Sadly I have not worn it since, what brought it back to my attention was testing ""At The Barbers"" from Maison Martin Margiela.

This a very pleasant, informal scent that while not a magnificent scent one will be urged to continue sniff at is one which I can\'t think anyone wouldn\'t enjoy.

I would not really recommend it for anyone over that age. It's just a little...underdeveloped. Very much alike the rest of the Claiborne fragrances- sweet, soapy, and clean.  Spray recommendations- one to the chest, one to the neck, and done. Don't overdo it on this cologne. The purpose of it is to emit a clean vibe, without being overpowering.  This has no best season.

Usually Claiborne's men's fragrances owe much to Curve's synthetic core and upon initial spray, Mambo is no different. It's when it settles in that Mambo begins to develop a personality all its own despite none of its elements (individual notes) really distinguishing themselves or even standing out from the whole chemical mess. This is synthetic stuff to the core but unlike other Claiborne fragrances, Mambo never makes a show of being such. Instead, it paints a picture in broad strokes, leaning on its total representation as a rather inoffensive, pleasant citrus aromatic herbal with a hint of floral that doesn't leave much ground for development or evolution. Some of the earlier reviews are spot on in relation to Mambo's ability to rise above its rather cheap ingredients and yet still offer a very pleasant wear. The citrus and green top holds steady the whole way through and never really flickers out, making Mambo a linear but non-cloying experience because projection is rather subtle after the initial three quarters of an hour. A nice, underrated budget fragrance that can be had for around $10 for a 3.4 oz. if you look hard enough at a discounter near you. I didn't get spectacular longevity or projection out of this despite a lot of reviews to the contrary. In general 4-6 hours was the standard with lower to moderate projection after the first hour of wear.  Because of its synthetic soul, Mambo defies critical analysis as the notes seem to have been crafted as one full piece rather than a bunch of individual separate pieces that evolve from top to heart to base. Mambo is a sweet, citrusy, aromatic dust cloud of many herbs blended into a mojito mix before the alcohol is added. A good budget fragrance that also benefits from its incredible versatility for all seasons and occasions."", ""In my humble opinion this is one of the few cheap scents that is actually worth your money. Mambo is dark, woody, earthy, sharp, and mysteriously sensual. Much better buy than Voyage by Nuatica! The sharpness cuts through the cold weather and earthiness gives it a warm sensual feeling making this a refreshingly versatile scent day or night! (Although, I think summer nights hit the sweet spot with this one ;)  Longevity and projection are excellent too. At this price (no more than $15 tops!) you simply can't go wrong. Well blended and definite must have!"", ""Bought for $15 based on positive reviews and a crying need to add more heat-friendly options to my collection. Starts out with citrus/bergamot (not sweet), then a half hour later moves to lavender and caraway, where it stays. This latter stage reminded me of a better executed Sung PH. But though it's better, I still didn't like where it wound up. The combination is a flat, slightly metallic scent that reminds me of Tusse, the womens roll-on deodorant that my mom wore. Not the same, but creates associations yadablabla. I love the taste of caraway but it's plain that the synthetic olfactory version doesn't do it for me. Scent: 3/10 Sillage: 5/10 Longevity: 5/10"", ""Fantastic, classic, masculine scent that 99% of women I encounter absolutely love. It ALWAYS turns heads then the women walk over to me and ask what I'm wearing. I never tell."", ""The pyramid makes this sound like a no-brainer. Unfortunately, it's far too assertive for my taste.

It's somewhat cloying, almost in the way that claiborne sport is but it's not offensive. Go easy on the spraying though because it projects loudly for the first hour or so. I personally recommend it's younger brother Mambo Mix, as that is a more versatile fragrance and less of a statement. Either way, they both smell good, last long, and are inexpensive.  7.5/10 - mambo 8/10 - mambo mix"", ""Without a doubt Mambo is one of the most underrated and overlooked gems I've ever encountered. I cannot figure out how this fragrance never generated more buzz than it did. It smells unlike just about anything I've smelled while remaining familiar and cozy. It's warm and spicy and one might very well imagine the motif of a couple dirty dancing. Mambo is something of a kitchen sink fragrance though. Picking out individual notes is a dubious affair at best. Rather, it buzzes as a sort of singular and unified accord. Admittedly this does lead to a bit of boredom with the scent as a whole as it does not really develop or deconstruct through the entire life of the scent. Just the same smell beginning to end. But it is such an absolutely amazing smell that I forgive it for lacking development. Longevity is remarkable. I put Mambo on and still easily pick up on it for every bit of 8 hours and up. This might lead you to believe that it is a powerhouse and I would agree. Yet, strangely, with a few sprays it's always (and I do mean always) wafting up to greet you without knocking you or anyone else's block off. Any scent I've ever used with this degree of longevity and presence generally has me wishing to wash it off before I get a headache. But Mambo just smoothly reassures you that it isn't going anywhere soon. Sillage is just about equal to the longevity. You know where one that is wearing Mambo has just recently been without suffocating the entire room. It's lingering presence isn't loud but gently enduring. Nothing about the fragrance comes across as synthetic whatsoever and coupled with the 'throw in everything but the kitchen sink' approach is testament to the competence of the parfumier that created it, Carlos Benaim, an all star of the fragrance industry. I've noticed just about everything Liz Claiborne puts out, aside from the frequently lambasted Curve and the phenomenon it spurred, is overlooked. Perhaps it's fatigue from the glut of Curve flankers the house continues to pile on. But there's been several other very competent offerings from the house of Claiborne that warrant a second look. Spark and Mambo immediately come to mind with the latter being the better of the two.  By all means give this fragrance a try if you like warm and spicy scents.

It\'s just perfect.', 'I wore this when I was younger, as it was my night-time, warm weather scent. Mambo also worked in the cold, if you wanted to ""smell"" warmer. Took a test of it after many years and found its not that bad. I don\'t hate it, but it is not really my cup of tea anymore, as I\'ve gone from nightclubs to more local bars or dives. I still appreciate the warmth, spiciness and masculinity of it, but it is slightly too sweet and jumbled for me now. I think of nightclubs in Miami when I smell this (probably because I wore it then). The olfactory equivalent to the young man\'s ""going out shirt"" (black button up). Of course I\'ve replaced my G.O.S. with a jacket, and so too this cologne. Still not bad for what it is, not a shameful option for a hot weather/nightclub scent.', ""I hated this cologne when I bought it, it sat around for two years, I tried it again, gagged and had to shower just to get the smell off of my arm. It's worse than an old lady who hasn't bathed in two weeks and covers it up with lavender perfumes from the 1940's. Seriously. Reminiscent of a nursing home bathroom, except it projects like crazy and has the longevity of a zombie. Expect it to be stuck on your body until you shower."", 'I found this at TJ Maxx a few years ago, and initially I didn\'t think this was a terrible fragrance. It just comes across as very strong, and for me that was more in a bad way. It\'s definitely more of a romantic fragrance, but at the same time, it\'s romantic in a ""gold chains, open shirt, macho, overpowering"" type of way that cloys a bit too much for my preferences. It also felt very synthetic, as if each note was intended to be over-the-top.  In short, wearing this is not a subtle statement, and you need to be the right personality for pulling this off. I just don\'t know many people who can. I ended up regifting mine.

The whole fragrances is extremely mellow. There's a burst of aromatic, tangy spice for bare seconds in the opening, but after that it dries down very papery and neutral. I get the sweet note, but the fruit accord is vague and undynamic. The tobacco, suede, and incense are all also faint, powdery shadows that lack any sort of distinct shape.

It adheres very well to my skin and clothes, it is extremely orthodox and seriously does its job of making us smell good. The opening gives the sensation of being bland, equal to any scent, but when it dries the magic arrives. I don't find it too sweet, and I can feel the smell of plum, not when it is ripe, but rather a bit Sour/sweet and I feel it for several hours in my case. The tobacco note is fantastic, one of the best I have felt, it does not have the sweetness of The One D&G, or Pure Havane, because in this case it does not have a honeyed note that gives it that characteristic. I tried to perceive the cinnamon, but in vain, it was impossible to isolate it, despite being such a strong note. Age: 30+ Aroma: pleasant Longevity: supersonic close to skin  Versatility: rather nocturnal and autumn. Bottle: regal, beautiful. Use it with caution because it is very sharp, in fact it can be used as a bladed weapon. Disadvantage: discontinued, difficult to find at a affordable price. The other thing is that it can be confused with the modern version, so read well before getting it.

Intoxicating. And unusual. Opens with a slightly anisic, slightly citric, buttery, spicy, sweetness (albeit a mild, understated honey-like sweetness) and soon becomes rich and resonant as what I presume is tobacco comes to the fore. There\'s a leathery note, patchouli, sandalwood and some other things that my inexpert nose cannot identify, but the effect is very three dimensional. The dry down is sublime - leather-woody-patchy and what is apparently plum and/or dried fruit (although I would never have identified these on my own). I can see why some have compared this to Le Dandy. MfM has a similar effect and suggests urbane gentlemanly sophistication: The fragrance of a man who has tout vu, tout lu, tout bu. Or thinks he has. I could see someone like Oscar Wilde wearing this. Michael for Men is one of a handful of fragrances that sets off ""fireworks"" in my brain: I have to constantly resist the urge to reapply for the sheer delight of savouring both the fragrance itself and the cerebral pyrotechnics created by a fresh application of MfM hitting my olfactory system. Reminds me of the discontinued Versace Man (the one in the purple flacon with tobacco and saffron) - the two smell nothing alike but for me they evoke a similar emotional response.

It's a special occasion scent. Not something casual imo."", 'This is outstanding. The plum and dried fruit is strong and persistent through the lifecycle. It\'s similar to Le Dandy by D\'Orsay, but stronger performance. But Le Dandy has a stronger and more luxuriously delicious gourmand aspect, like rum-soaked spiced plum cake. Really good stuff. In fact, Michael for Men by Michael Kors and Le Dandy by D\'Orsay would probably make a perfect layering pair. They have similar overall scent profiles, and it should offer the best of both: performance and lux gourmand scent. Maybe spray the Le Dandy on the upper torso or neck closer to the nose to enjoy the shorter-lived rum-soaked spice and plum cake in the opening and into the mid, while the longer-lasting and stronger-projecting Michael would shore up the mid and the far drydown. I also have John Varvatos OG, which is also similar although less so, so I might test a triple layering. I\'ve been wearing a clone of Bond no. 9 Andy Warhol and comparing it to Michael for Men by Michael Kors. It was apparent the two were similar, mainly because of the shared plum note. Andy Warhol is closer to Michael for Men that John Varvatos Dark Rebel, that\'s for sure, and maybe even closer than the Varvatos OG. The main differences in Andy Warhol is that it is a bit less sweet, a bit more ""creamy"" and thick due to the amber note being more prominent, a little more smokey/earthy probably due to woody/oud accords, and the plum in Michael for Men manifests being paired with the dried fruits note in the base, and Michael for Men being a bit more Gourmand. I\'m considering added Andy Warhol to this layering group. Update: I have tried the above suggested triple layering with Le Dandy and John Varvatos and it is fantastic! In fact, I now treat these three frags as one package in wearing. Can\'t recommend it enough. And fyi, even though I\'ve never tried the 2014 reformulated version of this, called Michael Kors for Men, it seems to be the epitome of what ""watered down"" means. Weaker performance, different notes (plum and dried fruits in the base removed). This 2001 Michael by Michael Kors OG seems by the evidence to be CONSIDERABLY better than the 2014 slightly renamed reformulation. Oh, and this is NOT an ""Aromatic Fougere"" fragrance as listed on this page, no matter how you slice it.', ""Hidden gem that is discontinued and now disappearing from retailers. This opens with a boozy plum and spices. Reminds me of a plum simmering in brandy or cognac with some cinnamon and star anise thrown in. Kinda like Plum Japonais and as the opening transitions to mid the plum and boozy start to fade into the background before almost disappearing in the drydown. A slightly sweet pipe tobacco emerges along with some leather. No cloying vanilla, tonka, honey or amber here. This is really wonderful and worth seeking out. I traded mine away but missed it and had to get another. In fact this is the only fragrance I traded away and regretted and wound up repurchasing. I tried a lot of tobacco based scents under the $300 and nothing really comes that close to this. Most have too much sweetness and don't let the tobacco shine.

Very special and original composition, both in how you experience this scent, and, in my opinion, the ingredients and aroma chemicals utilized also. This scent sets itself apart from many other tobacco scents I've tried. While being dark and masculine it has an air of gentlemanliness to it. Sadly discontinued and has been reformulated since. However if you love tobacco scents, or perhaps even tobacco/incense style scents, this version is a must have. Top 10 all time tobacco scents IMO. The down side is the performance and longevity.

I actually have a full 75ml bottle of this for sale if anyone is interested.', 'A fairly recent discovery is Michael for Men and what a gem it is. This is a very atypical tobacco scent, lacking the ubiquitous Tonka Bean base note. The fruity accords are pleasant and there is a tingly sensation, perhaps from the star anise. I can\'t think of another juice in my den with that ingredient. Projection is moderate and sillage is, imo, small. Over-application is a must ;-) Longevity is also mediocre...sadly. Re-application is required for a 12 hour+ experience. Good scent for the office as it will definitely not offend. I call this my ""signature scent"", as it is probably the bottle I reach for more often than any other. It\'s such a pleasing scent (SWMBO approved), that I procured two back-up bottles. Worth the effort searching for.', 'If I were to describe this one I would say that there are two prominent notes: fruit and tobacco. Since I do not like fruity accords, all I can say is that I find the fruit notes discordant, to the point that I am reminded of my preferences. It is a good quality scent, no doubt - regardless of the ""sillage - longevity"" combo, it is well crafted in its complexity and the way notes play in its evolution. However, I assume the blend without the dry fruits and the plum would be much closer to my tastes. Edit: Generously applied I can get really nice whiffs of the blend\'s basenotes after light sweating. This changes the review altogether.', 'I see no one has been on this board for many months! I\'m not sure what fragrance I was originally searching that eventually led me to buy the vintage Michael. I spend way too much time reading these things and then bouncing to the reviews for bottles listed in the ""this fragrance reminds me of"" section. Anyway, speaking of a fragrance this reminds me of. Call me crazy, but does anyone else think this kind of smells a bit like Drakkar Noir in the post 1 hour drydown phase? Not a one for one match, but kinda in the same ballpark. Interested to hear your opinions on that comparison.', ""It's been awhile since I last used MKM...am I ever glad I did. I have the original version created by Givenchy. As soon as I sprayed it on my skin...there was a WOW factor! 3-5 minutes after spraying it I get a swath of honey sweet notes coming from emeli mixed with a rich suede vib giving it a luxurious aroma. Incense adds to complex elements which is appealing and awakens your nose meter. As I take in my second a large breath, I'm able to pick up the woodsy/anise notes adding a the richness of the entire aroma giving it that unique characteristic. Both longevity and Sillage are well worth seeking out the original version. Overall, I wouldn't be able find another cologne which is as well balanced as this one unless I want to spend a lot of money. I enjoy the deep smokey/suede blend with that sweet note lingering throughout. It's a definite winter cologne best during the evening when you go out and you want to feel good. 9/10"", 'Michael for Men (2001) -  A favorite tobacco forward fragrance that doesn\'t smell like anything else out there as it is both retro and modern all at once. Even the 2014 re-issue has a much different composition, while maintaining only a touch of the original\'s backbone. I really enjoy both versions, but reach for the vintage more often especially in cooler weather.  Fortunately, the vintage is still widely available on-line in 1, 2.5, and 4 oz bottles so check it out while you still can. Michael Kors produces a full line for men today, but in 2001 there was only one choice - ""Michael""... and he got it right the first time. 4 stars.', ""Michael for Men has been my favorite fragrance for many years. I can't count the time people say how good the cologne smells, even after wearing for hours. I've bought every bottle I can off eBay and am down to my last small travel bottle. Taking the advice from other posters, I am wearing Pasha more frequently but can't say I like it as well. Does anyone have any suggestions for a similar fragrance to replace Michael?"", ""Wow, this is complex and unusual, in a way that bridges aromatics from the 80's on through to the present.  First impressions: Fresh and clean at the top, in a way that reminds me of the likes of 80's mainstays such as Pierre Cardin (the water tower bottle). I'm sure it's not even close, but it does evoke that sort of distant memory for me. As it dries down, what I pick up is redolent of that ethereal peppery incense backdrop so beautifully represented in Penhaligon's Opus 1870 (and similarly so in Azzaro Visit), but fleshed out with a touch of sweet, dried fruit and unsmoked tobacco. Up close, I also pick up evergreen and just the faintest suggestion of that leathery, woodsy goodness of Aramis. There's a lot going on in this bottle, to where I'd say one's impression will be very much influenced by things like temperature and the manner in which one applies it to one's self. Case in point: I applied more heavily the day after my initial opinion, and although I still picked up most of the same notes, it did become a bit of a mess -- so go lightly. This also drives home (for me, anyway) a key difference between a borderline niche Opus 1870 -- that tolerates overspraying well, and a designer frag that can seem like it's trying a bit too hard.  When used properly, Michael comes together as what is unmistakably a gentleman's scent, the smell of a man who has his shit together. But when oversprayed, it unfortunately comes across as a muddled and cooked, early 2000's cheapie. Jeckyll and Hyde. I still can't decide which one this truly is. Still, I'm a bit sad that this was discontinued, but happy to have scored a small bottle for me. :)"", 'Great classic blend of sweet sticky and dry spices, fruits, and tobacco that could have lasted the test of time. Instead, it was replaced.  Damn!', ""This is a great cold weather classic. I picked this up in the early 2000s and enjoyed it a lot. A few years back I THOUGHT I was picking up one I loved from the ol'days. It Was NOT. I bought Michael Kors for Men not the ORIGINAL MICHAEL for Men. Maybe if I had not had this 1st the 2nd would have been ok.

Hard to describe, quite complex to my nose. To my nose, it opens green, then shift shortly after on a spicy tobacco and patchouli, with a noticeable sweet plum and dried fruit support. It will stay like that until the drydown, except for the entrance of a strong honey-like animalic note (but not sweet), that will have MFM promoted from good to great. Overall performance is above average: projection is strong in the opening, and will become moderate after 60-90min. I was a little underwhelmed by the opening, but this fragrance takes its meaning during the drydown imo. It's not really a refined scent proper for dates/formal events, as it definitely stays in the designer area. Still, very full bottle worthy, even if I wouldn't spend more than $70/80 for a large vintage bottle, since there is more interesting stuff over that price. Best if worn during Fall evenings, 30+ Note: this review is based on a batch of 2013 (thus original formulation). I recently paid less than $20 shipped for three 0.5 oz/15ml travel sprays + atomizer (total: 1.5oz/45ml of juice), so it's still possible to find some vintage juice for an honest prices!"", 'Reaaaaallly nice. I\'m surprised it doesn\'t have a higher score. Michael starts off wonderfully spicy, with a lot of warmth and a piquant, snappy bite. I can pick up on some cinnamon and caraway lending heat, and star anise with a sweet, cool kick at the top. There\'s also an almost-animalic like quality in the mix, giving the fragrance something of a daring edge, abeit in a pleasant, wearable sort of way. It\'s a great start to ""Michael"" which only gets better as it develops. Soon in, the tobacco and suede become apparent, establishing the composition\'s heart. The tobacco is fresh and slightly sweet, a true pipe tobacco, and it\'s blended seamlessly with a smooth, velvety suede, subtle, but present and providing a soft, plush texture to the mid. While the spices remain on top, they\'ve receded somewhat, no longer as prominent or pronounced as they were in the first 45 minutes. Curiously, Michael\'s fruity notes are in the base, rather than the top, and gradually a vivid, substantial blend of plum and dried fruits (apricot, prune, dates, etc.) enters the picture until it becomes the dominant accord in the fragrance. The plum brings a sweeter, rounded, boozy and personable, alluring dimension to the whole, and now Michael is at its zenith, with everything working together in harmony, giving off an incredibly enjoyable smell well-suited for fall and winter scenarios. There are the warm, piquant spices from the opening dancing around in the background, the pipe tobacco providing a fresh, aromatic heart, the smooth hint of suede, and dark fruits enveloping everything in their soft, purplish glow. It really is a great fragrance--expertly pieced together and with all of its key accords and notes vivid and discernible.  Michael would make an excellent signature scent. It would also work well for daily wear during the fall and winter, and even as a date fragrance. It has an elegant, yet casual and easy feel, which really makes it a joy to wear--you\'ll feel sharp and composed but not overdressed or self-conscious. Performance is solid, with good longevity, and projection that\'s completely appropriate for this kind of scent--substantial and present without ever shouting. If you are currently looking for a spicy/fruity fragrance with tobacco and suede, this is one of the best options available. Final rating: 9/10 A Side Note: ""Michael"" as it was originally called, was released in 2001. I\'m not sure when exactly, but it was eventually discontinued. Original bottles of Michael said just that--Michael--on the box and bottle. But somewhere along the way, before it was discontinued, they began calling it ""Michael Kors."" As a result, ""Michael Kors"" was printed on the new boxes and bottles of what was once ""Michael."" The problem here is that this change can make it difficult to source a bottle of this discontinued juice. That\'s because an entirely new fragrance was created and released in 2013, this time called ""Michael Kors for Men."" It\'s not the same fragrance, though they may smell slightly similar, there\'s really a big difference between them, and it\'s the old juice that\'s much better. So how can you tell the difference between the bottles of ""Michael Kors"" that were originally ""Michael,"" and produced in 2001, from the bottles of the completely new fragrance produced in 2013 called, ""Michael Kors?"" Here\'s the key: 1) The bottles are different: The discontinued version has ""Michael Kors"" printed on the front of the bottle in pretty small, horizontal letters. The new version says ""Michael Kors"" in much larger, vertical letters running along the side of the bottle. The discontinued version\'s cap is black with gray and white swirls running through it. I\'m pretty sure that the new fragrance\'s cap is pure black. 2) Furthermore, the old boxes are a chrome-like silver, while the 2013 Michael Kors comes in a box that is more of a charcoal-gray, dark silver. The old version\'s box is constructed so that the fragrance is pulled out of its side, from a smaller, black box that fits into the silver box. The 2013 opens like a regular box, from the top. There is no smaller box that fits into it that you can pull out. 3) The other information I\'ve provided is useful if you can\'t get the batch code off the box. But if you can, just check the batch code to make sure the bottle was produced before 2013. As I said earlier, I\'m not exactly sure when it was discontinued, so I don\'t know what dates they run up to. But as long as it\'s before 2013, you can be assured you\'re not getting the new ""Michael Kors for Men."" The website checkfresh.com provides batch code information for most fragrance brands.', 'I have a fifth of my bottle left. why did you take this away from us, Michael? WHY??', 'I love it. It has a similar feel to versace dreamer in that it is a tobacco scent for the winter that also happens to be fresh and energetic. Ideal for people who want to keep active during the cold months. Very good for the office it is undoubtedly a winter fragrance but smells clean and professional also.', 'The opening is gorgeous, with that blend of dried fruits -- figs, dates, that sort of thing -- and plum, anise, sweet tobacco, and incense. The bouquet of sweetness puts me in mind of Paco Rabanne 1 Million (or Remy Cigar) a little bit, and even more so I find it similar to Burberry London in the way it mixes fruit with tobacco and leather/suede.  In fact, I alternate between wearing London and this scent during the holidays because they both capture that essence so well in different ways.', ""Best Fall Fragrance 2016 / 2017 by youtube reviewer Gent Scents Michael for Men is an extremely good fragrance from a top designer. I didn't expect the richness, but this is made by Michael Kors, as a division of Givenchy thereby attesting to the quality of the notes. Definitely a spicy gourmand that packs a punch - and I mean that in a good way. If you want to be noticed - then this is a fragrance that stands out, in a good way. Some people have said it is a throwback to the 80's powerhouse boozy scents with its tobacco, vanilla, and leather.  The boozy vibe is produced by the link of dark plum, anise, spices and tobacco. I don't believe a touch of rum is even included in the mix as the real source of booziness but you could fool me. The deeply masculine and traditional tone is determined by the chord of bergamot, dry woods, patchouli, tobacco and may be a touch of ambergris. The final outcome is simply comforting (in a boozy, smokey and leathery way), warm and conservative with undertones of honeyed tobacco and spices. It is a cozy and comfortable scent meant for intimacy. This is a skin scent, although it projects well from clothing (so a mix would be advised to get more longevity and sillage). Michael for Men has been around for more than a decade and I can see a distinct comparisons in the dried fruit to many John Varvatos fragrances. Great quality, excellent composition, exquisitely chic and lasts 6+ hours on my skin. After that, you can either reapply or move on. After all, you are left with a very sweet and expressive dry-down that is a nice memory - no reason to feel cheated. Michael Kors has created a masterpiece and still stands out after more than a decade. Very Good! Scent - 4.5+/5 stars; Longevity and Sillage - 3.5/5 stars; Overall - 4.5/5 stars for sheer enjoyment! Just like good sex, it doesn't last forever, but when it's good - it's damn good and you think of it often afterward...wanting more."", ""it`s totally mature scent.tobbaco, patchouli and incense make a pungent scent which was a little harch I didn`t like but after half an hour the fruity notes revealed and mixed with. tobbaco and became nice.it was in my list to buy but now my mind has changed and not to buy it till far future. Update : now it's time to buy it after retest it today specially it has getting harder and harder to find the vintage one in the picture above , and suprisingly my taste has changed by long time passing it's a hi quality tobbaco scent .it 's tobbaco is kind of pipe tobbaco which is smooth and gentle.plum exist at thr first hour making it georgous."", 'When i first got this more than 5 years ago, it instantly became one of my favourites. I loved it so much i was using the M picture with the naked bodies for some of my social profiles.  At that time i knew nothing of the ""mischieves"" the fragrance brands were secretly (or more openly) inflicting on us. This Michael has also been changed. My previous bottle had only Michael written on it, and i believe the cap was of better quality. The new one is plasticky, light, and, well, cheap. The fragrance itself seems to be the same (maybe a bit cheapened) but i have the feeling the old one had more depth and was much rounder.  I don\'t get the top notes. I think Michael is not interested in them either.  What we get from the spray is what we remain with until the end - The scent of dried fruits (think dates, medlars, mango, papaya, plums) is ripe and intense, while the tobacco adds a dry and smoky dimension to this overall nice fragrance. It\'s best within its first hour. A bit too loud maybe but certain statements are best said loud. Smells thin and tired during the later stage. ***(**)', ""definitely not to be confused with the newer Michael Kors by Michael Kors. The first time i sprayed this on i didn't like it... smelled like burnt rubber or something. But then it opened up and i absolutely love it now. Reminds me of Thanksgiving and Christmas at my aunt's house. A nice tobacco/potpourri type smell. After buying the newer version (renamed Michael Kors by Michael Kors), i realized this version is much better and so i bought one on ebay. The tobacco note is what makes it. It gives this frag a nice deep warm earthy smell that the reformulation lacks. Love it."", ""It is another banal day in what you always thought would have lent itself to the American view of paradise. A beautiful home, a loving family, good friends, yoga classes...whatever. You're staring at your spice rack - coriander, tarragon, anise, cinnamon, cardamom, caraway....what the hell am I doing here? Where's the risk? Why does tomorrow have to be like every other day? Compelled, you adorn your most dangerous outfit, faded and torn jeans and a sueded leather jacket, and light the finest cigar you've been saving for that 'special occasion' - whatever the hell that was supposed to be. You look like death - the sexiest version, that is...sexy as death...hell? Who gives a fuck - you're going to kill it. You go out in search of trouble, in search of meaning, connection, a foolish affair - anything to make you feel alive again. You exude smoked seude and tobacco - that of a phoenix that has risen from the ashes of a past life. After hours of sheepish glances and other shenanigans, you wind up at some new nightclub blasting something you didn't know was a thing. This has to be a mistake...you go in anyways. You scan the room - somewhere in the neon strobing you see the trouble you've been seeking. You make your way over and strike up a conversation - it's painful and awkward but it's new, it's revitalizing. She oozes plums and honey - you want a bite. She invites you back to her place, you don't refuse. Her place reeks of patchouli, incense, and sandalwood...she still smells like heaven - your debauchery ensues to an exhilarating end. You fall asleep in each other's arms - this is the closest she comes to finding love in an ephemeral world. Morning disturbs your flight of fancy - you must return to that bittersweet life. You politely exit - the night of passion clings firmly to your skin...the decadent plum, the hippie sandalwood, the honeyed tobacco, the smoked suede, and the nutty musk of carnal desires. You feel different, a little wicked - you wouldn't have it any other way. Day 55 - The blind Listening to: Radiohead - All I Need Disclaimer: I've never done this in my life - I've heard countless stories and seen things that have lent to this review. Again, it's an elaboration on a theme - I hope you enjoy it! Notes: This is for the old version - the new one is similar but it lacks the honeyed plum note that makes this gorgeous! The opening is a bit of a kitchen, minus the sink - a touch of tarragon, anise, a smoked caraway, a pinch of coriander, and a powdery cinnamon. All of this is expertly blended with a rich tobacco note that is paired with a smoky suede note all drenched in a beautiful honeyed plum. Parts of this are dangerous and parts are nearly edible! The base brings touches of sandalwood (connects the honeyed plum and tobacco), a dry patchouli (to accent the suede), and incense (furthers the smoke note in tobacco and suede). As it gets quieter, the scent becomes more of a smoky and musky skin with just a touch of sweet - this fume is divine and is in my top 6 for a reason! It lasts from 8 to 14 hours on my skin and can easily be worn by either sex - try not to let this beauty get to your head!"", ""I feel this could be unisex. Especially the dry down. Perhaps it is meant exclusively for men, but I'm saying its unisex because I enjoy it so much. The dry down is very warm, sweet and comforting. I enjoy this so much!  I agree with other reviews that the intro is nauseating! I felt assaulted by too many giant notes. If the top is ignored, as many reviews suggested, the dry down is perfection.  I also agree that the sillage is beyond enormous! The longevity is amazing. It has the power of an attar, but it's cologne.  I sometimes feminized this with vanilla essential oil once it settled down. I recieved so many compliments.  To be clear, I am an older career woman who smokes. So this works great on me!  I wish it had not been discontinued! It was moderately priced and lasted such a long time. The Incense, Dried Fruit, Plum (and my addition of vanilla) made that sweet rich Tobacco heavenly!"", ""gave this one to my father. He is 83 and now starting to enjoy parfumes :-) I'm so happy for him. Because his eyes are very bad he can't see much. But his nose works quite well. He can smell the incense and tabacco.

Then began to be slightly nauseated at the similarity to a sickening chewing tobacco, like getting a big whiff of some frat-dude's Skool tin.

WTF??? nice scent tough.', ""I got this when it first came out, and love it. Mind you, this was around the time nothing but freaking aquatics were around. At the time I felt it was a wonderful throwback to the old school frags of yesteryear. Got a sample for nostalgic purposes, but I must say... it fell short of expectations. For once, it reminded me of a whole lot of other, far superior (in my opinion, of course) fragrances like Givenchy Gentleman, even a whiff of Antaeus. And that's part of why I wasn't awed by Michael... it smell like a million other powerhouses, but without focus. A plain mess. A good effort from Kors, just one that doesn't really wow my world. Maybe then. Not now.  Smell great, my friends. Update: It's an unusual cold day today in S Florida, and this is the time to wear this. I am not crazy with the fruty/plummy element in Kors, but I remember why I was fond of this around Y2K... it was a bold re-interpretation of the fougere, at a time of nothing but Cool Water spinoffs, done by no less than one of the most mainstream designers: Michael Kors. It was and still is a nice effort. Fresh and dirty at the same time (thank the tobacco and leather)... And much better than the current offering at department stores.  Second update: It is a hot and humid summer in S Fla (what else is new?) and I was on the mood for some Kors. Well, funny as it may sounds, upon application, I was immediately reminded of a classic: Azzaro. Yes!!! I know this may sound like heresy for some, but its basically a matter of replacing the anise in Azzaro for a fruity/plummy note and tone down the lavender and ante up the patch. The ONLY downside of wearing this in the heat of summer is that the fruity/plummy note really goes beserk, in your face. I suppose in moderation it may be tolerable. What the hell, I like it loud. Still, I would MUCH recommend original Kors for colder weather."", 'I like this one. Got a sample at the mall. First is sort of dry juicy fruity scent, but that only lasts a couple minutes. then it quickly starts to warm up and turn into a really nice rich and spicy tobacco scent, mixed in with other accenuators giving some freshness, spicyness, dryness, powderyness, but overall it is a rich warm spicy tobacco-y scent. Very nice, rich. Yeah it probably has a lot of patchouli too. I like it.', 'Michael Kors men opens with a blast of plum and fruity notes. Subsequently these turn a little bit soapy and the tobacco starts evolving. Further on the latter gets accentuated by spices and cardamom. Patchouly and sandalwood building up its base. Ipso facto this is not something you might wear with a t-shirt but rather well groomed in a suit. Somehow it is mandatory to appear respectable and elegant while wearing this scent. For the classy gentlemen definitely something to try.', 'First of all this is a givenchy perfume. A very unique one. Smells like a pipe tobacco flavoured with dried fruits Longevity and projection are excellent. Its not for everybody so try before you buy', ""So, this one was a blind buy from my side. Enjoyed it at first, heavy on the tobacco, plum, incense, cinnamon and a slight hint of cardamum. After wearing it a few times, I got a recurring smell of prunes (yes, PRUNES) coming through which started annoying me. Also, I feel it somehow smells dated - not old school, but dated, I can't quite put my finger on it. Anyway, after some months I finally gave in and traded it for another EdT. Sillage and longevity are just fine and I like it, but somehow it's just not me. I advise you to test it once or twice before buying."", 'There are very few scents that I own that just screams Christmas the way that MKM does. Although I must say, MKM isn\'t the typical ""run of the mill"" festive holiday juice as I implied, it\'s a bit more brooding and gothic by composition in my opinion.

Funny thing is, as synthetic smelling as MKM is, this fragrance still somehow makes you feel so alive when wearing it. A warm blanket of light tobacco and anise wrapped in dark, dried fruits surrounded with enough plum to make Little Jack Horner green with envy. It\'s dark and mysterious while keeping cheerful and upbeat. People are going to like this and want to be around you in a big way.  In retrospect, MKM is what Yatagan should have smelled like.

I own vintage Nicole Smith for men, they are both similar with a rich deep aroma of amber and honey making it very luxurious. MK is much more complex with herbal/woodsy notes with a rich aroma after it settles.  What brings this fragrance at very sophisticated level is cardamom, anise star and dried fruit all coming together beautifully with patucchli making it fantastic. Longevity and Silage is excellent lasting well past 8hrs...very consistent with minimal change in aroma.

Projection and longevity is about the usual thing, which is to say disappointing.', 'This is just a beautiful fragrance. I will always keep a bottle of it. Perfect balance between the tobacco and incense and the dried fruit, plum and patchouli. Initially the tobacco and incense comes through but then it sweetens up but not too much that it becomes a summer fragrance.I love the bottle as well. A++ in my books.', ""I find this a little bit tweedy, feels a bit like a men's fragrance was made because it had to be. The women's selection of MK is superb, they are classy.

It is very heavy in tobacco, fruits, and incense. However, it is backed up by spices and woods. It smells very masculine and rugged however it is not in your face. Michael Kors for men is pleasant with soft to moderate projection with decent longevity 6-8 hours but it will sit mostly close to the skin. This is perfect for dating, casual, or even dressed up because it smells classy enough. I would say it has a similar vibe to pure malt with regard to the berry note. However, I would say this is closer to pure havane and burberry london the pure malt. This has the spice of burberry london which almost gives it a spiced boozy wine or liquor accord. This is probably from the anise and cinnamon with fruits and incense. Overall it is a very well blended smooth cologne that is undoubtedly masculine. The biggest downfall is projection and longevity. With this many dark and heavy notes listed one would expect it to me beast mode in both regards. It is not! This will sit on your skin and not want to budge after even only a short while. If you are looking for a darker cologne for fall and winter to use in a work or dating situation this might do the trick. You will smell good and masculine without chocking anybody out. I would still recommend pure havane.', 'For me its a nice Tobaco and honey. Nothing of Pure Malt here. Its warm, sexy and masculine.

This is actually very nice, for 30 seconds while the top boozy note eclipses the synthetic tobacco scent. I find that many so-called ""tobacco"" colognes do not smell much like tobacco at all. Instead, they have a mixture of compounds that more closely resemble clove oil. This is also true of Cigar by Remy Latour. The rest of the base is a melange of powerful sweet spices (cinnamon, clove, nutmeg), much like a concentrated potpouree. This is blindingly powerful, and IF I wear it I avoid spraying it on my chest, but rather arms and back of head. I don\'t get the dried fruit at all. I had such high hopes for this, and am sadly disappointed. I do not recommend buying this blind unless you are a big fan of faux tobacco scents. (I smoke cigars and a pipe, I know what real tobacco smells like)', ""Another one of the true 'strong' scents. While the smell is reminiscent of fermenting fruit with an liquor vibe, it manages to stay cool and sweet. Fresh, almost. Unlike most sweet scents which turn warm and spicy, this remains cool and most importantly, it freaking lasts. It also maintains it's strength and sillage for an awfully long time. Even 10 hours later it's still sitting stubbornly on the skin, refusing to go away. Yes, it's a little odd. Sometimes sickly. But it's gorgeous, masterful and unique. One of the best and a staple in my wardrobe. 10/10"", 'Beautifully balanced, Michael Kors delivers a potent punch of masculinity beneath a sophisticated velvet glove. It pays homage to the heavily spiced colognes of bygone years and serves as a reminder that there is still a market for such releases, when done with a degree of modernism, sex appeal and sensible pricing. The fragrance opens with subtle boozy aromas (port, mulled wine or perhaps a heavily sherried single malt Whisky) and fruity notes (juicy plums, assorted dried fruits, raisins, etc...). These notes are kept in check by the dry tobacco accords and a gorgeously sharp array of peppery spice. The bottle itself is classic, simple, solid and elegant. Releasing this as his signature scent was a bold move by Michael Kors and one that deserves due praise. A modern treasure amongst designer fragrances. I am hoping to find a replacement bottle this year below the Christmas tree! Thumbs up ;-)', ""Wow, what an excellent blind buy this was! I have just sprayed it on a paper strip 2 minutes ago because I'm about to go to the gym, but I will get back to this.

It projects appropriately and lasts forever on me. Around 8pm I decided to try a bottle of whiskey I hadn't seen before. Bowmore Islay 8 year single malt. Half way through my first glass there's something very familiar. Take the fir out of MK for men and it's dead on. Smokey, slightly sweet, rich like honey obviously boozy. Is this a review for whiskey or cologne? I'll be wearing the frag and sipping the drink quite a bit in the coming days."", 'Used it loved it!! 125ml great bottle very heavy, great value. Let me assure you that when you perceive a cologne off your own skin or clothes, its completely different from when your movement releases the smell molecules towards others.  KEY: Others can smell it long after you nose has stopped picking it up. I envy those who can pick out individual notes and evaluate a cologne objectively from a strip or from skin. Its easy to describe Michael for men as ""stale"" ""urine-like"" etc. because that\'s what\'s easiest to pick up at close quarters when the notes are still bundled. But when they loosen up after a while you apprecaite that this is a power scent, a modern classic. A collector\'s item.', ""I have always imagined this fragrance as a assorted basket of dry fruits (raisins, apricot, dates) served on a layer of suede mat along with a pack of fine cigars. One thing I have noticed while using this fragrance is to spray more than 2-3 sprays on your wrist to experience its complete character. I do not find this fragrance to be very sweet as incense and patchouli provides a very masculine direction to this fragrance.  This fragrance is mostly suited to a cold climate but I also wear this to office. Longevity is good and sillage is soft to moderate for me. Its a nice fragrance and can easily be one's signature. I'm happy to have this in my rotation."", ""Revisiting this for today after a few weeks and how I love it's smoothness.  Sure I have superior fragrances in similar veins but this is thoroughly satisfying today.  It's sweetness is pulled off with dark mellow undertones.

I was new to the game and thought that MK smelled disgusting. A few days ago, I decided to revisit a couple of vintage scents and dug up this guy.

But I am very happy to find out MK suits me all the way. I won't feel 'overdressed' by it. It reminds a close relative to Hermes Rocabar, in fact I think of wear one or two spray of each for a more complex and unique performance, not that any one of them isn't unique enough, just because I think more fir resin would addmore nocturnal/wintery vibe. It is avery well balanced frag in which no note seems to stand out from the others but go along hand in hand forming an ultra masculine scent. This is not a shareable scent not even with the most avant garde women. Perfect for a man."", 'Sweet white tobacco, hints of booze, dried fruits reminiscent of apples and apricots, hints of plum, cinnamon, star anise and blonde leather start things off. Sweetness fades a bit going into the mid notes and dry down where warm spices like cardamom, cinnamon and anise plus some patch begin to dominate. Tobacco darkens a bit, suede and sandalwood notes remain in check. Fit for a well dressed gentleman in a business environment and more appropriate for cooler weather. Projection and sillage are quite good, longevity is average. Score 6.5/10', ""I tried john varvatos artisan black and had this nagging sense that it smells similar to 1 scent I had. Lo and behold, it's michael kors for men that I was actually trying to recall!  Matbe the similarity lies in the dried fruit smell.

My score: 4.25 out of 5."", '42gr, it\'s John Varvatos Vintage you\'re referring to. I put it above, you are right. I mentioned Michael Kors in my review of Varatos Vintage, in fact. JVV is a much higher qulaity, nicer, fragrance. Although these two are very similar in scent JVV is smoother, more natural smelling, much classier, and more sophisticated (too much so for me, actually). Personally, I like MK better at 34, yet although I adore neither, it\'s apparent that JVV is the far superior fragrance. It\'s just WAY TOO SERIOUS for someone like me. Maybe when I\'m 60 and ""the most interesting man in the world"" on don it. I picture the Dos Equis guy from the TV commercials wearing John Varatos Vintage as his signature scent. ;-) Classy stuff! Michael Kors, not so much. The cardamon in this Kors is overdone, and as cardamom in any amount, in any fragrance does, eventually makes my skin smell sour, hence the ""urine"" smell that was alluded to in a previous comment. I gave that man a thumbs up, although I still do ""like"" this scent. 7.5/10', ""I don't see honey listed, but I think it has some. It will be perfect for the time when fruitcake is ready to be served (or just some cognac).

I wonder if it will work on a rainy summer night. *** No veo miel listada, pero creo que tiene un poco. Será perfecta para las fiestas de invierno y el pastel de frutas (o un poco de cognac). Michael guarda algunas sorpresas cerca de la piel, que lo hacen muy bueno para una cita, algo ligeramente amargo, de tierra. Tiene también algunas transiciones encantadoras.

I don't know if it's my nose or my chemistry but this just doesn't settle down pleasantly on me. The initial impression has something A* about it (which I find a little too sweet for my taste). This soon settles down to a slightly powdery balmy suede on me. No smoke, no spice, no incense. The patchouli is distant and the tobacco just doesn't appear for me (maybe I'm used to English tobacco rather than American-style sweet tobacco? Pipe smokers will understand!). There is some dried fruit and plum but this also fritters itself away and I'm left a bit 'sweet/powdery'. Maybe it's just me?! I'll try again, but I actually washed this off after about 6 hours; I don't remember the last time I did that."", 'I bought this cologne on a whim and I am glad I did.

Very deep tobacco scent mixed with dried fruits. Nice longevity, decent projection. This is an amazing smell. It's also very masculine. I'm in my 40's, well-dressed professional and this fragrance suits my style. Sexy vibe to it."", ""i tried it yesterday,it's really different tobacco scent and wonderful,i liked it. i couldnt understand the longevity degree,4-5 hrs on my skin"", ""Fruity, spicy, tobacco.....the anise and patchouli actually compliment the tobacco and blends seamlessly with the fruity notes. Mature? Sure, but when was maturity frowned upon. It smells like gentleman...age 16-70. There is really no age range here. My only problem is I ignored this fragrace for years. It is a perfect signature scent for anything 70 degrees or cooler. I couldn't see myself wearing this in the heat it is potent. Think Japon Noir, think Frapin 1270, think Pure Malt, think Cooper Square. It is just a gorgeous fragrance. The sillage and projection makes it a perfect date, work, movie, dinner, professional scent. The aroma itself exudes class and sophistication yet the price (especially ebay and other places) makes this a steal. Often times we run to niche fragrances due to the complexity and uniqueness and this is a fragrance that deserves to be mentioned. Really quick here. Inital spray is a spicy sweetness, immediately the fruity notes come to the party then it becomes a bit darker but never does a dark note jump out. What you really have is a spicy, fruity, tobacco laden fragrance that sort of moves between semi-fresh to dark and mature. The longevity is great as I get about 6-8 hours. The projection is around the 4 hour mark then it comes in a bit but stays romantic through the duration. I think it is quite versatile and inoffensive. Again for me it is pure class as many tobacco fragrances tend to be on my skin. Overall I give it high marks. The price pushes this mark up quite a bit. Full bottle worthy from the frist spray an instant love."", 'Smells like off fruit, calms a little once dried and becomes more refined but the damage is done for me.

There are no gimmicks or distractions here, just a very deep, rich, almost ""chocolately"" feeling tobacco accord due to the dark, earthy, patchouli which is used perfectly here, and the intriguing, and classy hints of dried fruit and plum that form the basis of this refined scent. Longevity is quite good. I get about eight hours from it. Projection is also perfect (about arms length) for a scent such as this and helps, in part, to lend Michael Kors for Men it\'s more formal, sophisticated feel.  This isn\'t an ""exciting"" fragrance by any means, and I don\'t recommend this one to most guys under 30, however, this isn\'t the prootypical ""old man\'s"" fragrance either. No, it\'s is a very classy, masculine, sexy, mature, sophisticated, scent. At first few sniffs it seemed a tad boring to me and a somewhat generic, and to be honest, I wasn\'t sure why so many people have been raving about this scent. But while it isn\'t groundbreaking or revolutionary, Michael Kors IS very well-made and will serve you superbly in the office or on other more formal and even intimate ocassions. If you buy MKM and you don\'t appreciate it at first, I strongly reccomend giving it some time (maybe even trying it out directly against some others fragrances you own) and as so often happens, you may come to appreciate it just as much as I do, and that\'s... quite a lot! :) Highly reccomended. Overall: 7/10', ""I'm closing in on 40 and work in office setting and I'd been looking for a tobacco scent to add to my collection. I had rounded up a few: Pure Havane, Dirty English and this one.  I found MK to be a more polished, mature scent and also a better value than DE at a similar price point ($30 for a 4.2 oz tester). It had a smokier, stronger tobacco than PH for a much better price as well.  MK has now become my go to work scent because its not an overpowering tobacco scent. I get average projection on my skin but this leaves a nice sillage trail that gets compliments. The smoky tobacco note is reminiscent of Aventus to my nose which I like as well.  Long story short, I've sold DE and PH because MK is the superior tobacco office scent and better value IMO."", 'One of the ""richest"" scents I have ever smelled in terms of olfactive pyramid and its result on the skin. I must say this comparing with those colognes I see with lots of ingredients in their composition, in which the result is completely linear and simple, to the point of asking myself: “What about those notes A, B, and C that are here, in the pyramid?” In Michael for Men, this is different. It’s about one of those colognes that you can perfectly identify the existent notes and how they work. On my skin, the start is divinely spicy, with a wonderful and soft cinnamon, well blended with the star anise and beautiful notes of coriander and cardamom. The rest (bergamot, tarragon, etc.) I can’t feel with evidence. Its evolution has real notes of creamy tobacco, incense and, the comfortable part of this scent, with the suede. The base is hot and sweet at the same time. I feel sandalwood and plum. The notes of dried fruits are there, but I really don’t know the effect they cause.  The result: a sophisticated, elegant, and masculine scent. It is important to remember that this one was made for a division of Givenchy, what allows me to say with confidence: “now I understand the great quality”. To finish my review, I am going to do something that I am not used to doing, which is point the target of this cologne: I can’t imagine an 18-year-old OR a punk OR a tattooed hunk guy with his CK underwear and his tight t-shirts wearing this cologne and having the proper success. This cologne reminds me of professional environments, formal occasions, and, above all things, men with the posture and attitude of gentlemen.  Median projection with superb lasting. 10 stars!', ""I first tested this last week but was unimpressed possibly because right after spraying it I got caught in the rain. Regardless I found myself wanting to give it a second try so stopped by a store to do a second testing Well made, one of the best designer fragrances. A creamier blend than I am used to with most designer fragrances. This is an extremely masculine scent that sets itself apart from the pack. It is very distinguished and conjures an image of a thick oil painting of dried fruit in a leather box. The initial dried fruit scent eases you into the almost burgundy leather it ends with. I say burgundy leather because this is definitely a classier leather like a book binding not like a raw hide or a motorcycle jacket. Longevity is pretty good so far as I sprayed it about an hour and a half ago and it doesn't seem to have faded too much. Sillage seems moderate. Overall I recommend to anyone looking for a distinguished leather scent. As for leather scents this is more Ernest Hemingway than Steve McQueen."", 'Lo compre en Puerto Rico y es rico, tabaco suave, vainilla, pacholi, canela suave, y al final talco de barberia. Es clasico, estudien este perfume.', ""Ordered a sample and this is just a regular scent, not different at all, from what was launched in the 80's. The same 80's men line as boucheron, cristobal, gucci, etc. For me it smells like a tradtional barber shop. I am not purchasing a big bottle, even though it is very afordable. I can see myself just leaving this sample there in the corner and wear it once in a great while. If you want tobacco go for the cheap Cuba scents line up or a niche one like Costamor Tabacca (extremely good tobacco scent)."", ""I've only tested this one day, but after 6 hours I think its great. The 80's powerhouse idea scared me but the list of notes seemed perfect. It starts like a Thierry Mugler fragrance. Its sweet and projects quite a bit from one spray. The smokey incense with the patchouli and fruit are really nice. There seems to be something missing right in the middle to me but I'll have to try it again to figure it out. There's a pleasant green that stays for a while before the end. It gets to the musky, 80's dad, dry down while being subtle (or at least closer to the skin). I think it will be great in the cold but I'll have to wait a few months to see."", 'I received a sample do Kors for man and i have cartier pasha.

That sums up Michael Kors for men to me in just one word. The variety of top notes surprises me. I only, slightly, get a hint of anise before being hurtled immediately into the heart note of the best sweet tobacco aroma in a fragrance I have experienced yet.  Yes, later the plummy/incense/patchouli background stealthily eases its way in, but for the life of this fragrance, its all about the tobacco. Not quite the projection and sillage monster some would have you believe, this fragrance has solid longevity. I adore its ultra-smooth warmth and really do rate this fragrance very, very highly. The likes of Burberry London don't even come close. Oh, if you buy the 125ml bottle do take care... drop that hefty sucker on your foot and you'll know about it. Well I certainly did anyway...(ouch)"", 'very similar to azzaro elixir...more so when it comes to the dried fruits note...', ""Very good fragrance, love tobacco scent. At first I thought this would be simular to Dirty English but the tobacco obviously doesn't...thinking perhaps some boozy smell (probably by the fruity notes) but totally dominated by the tobacco. My girl told me that I smell like a MAN...so I'm assuming that is a compliment. Not very strong projection close to the skin and silage isn't that great but the longevity was around 6 hours on me then the only way you smell it was by smashing your nose into your own arm just to take a whiff. I say it's well done though not a masterpeice by any stretch."", ""Michael by Michael Kors is a rich elegant and utterly sophisticated scent for any gentleman of discerning style and taste. Hitting notes of leather, tobacco, and plum it has the feel of tony aristocratic mahogany paneled New York men's clubs, or a brisk walk to the boathouse in Central Park in the golden glow of a late afternoon in autumn. Certainly not for everyone, least of all a kid, this is strictly for a man who knows just who he is and where he is going. Five Gold Stars *****"", 'Very good fragrance from a top designer. I didn\'t expect the richness, but this is made (as a division) by Givenchy. I can see where the quality and notes come from. Definitely a spicy composition that borderlines on being a ""near-gourmand scent"" that packs a punch - and I mean that in a positive sense. If you want to be noticed - then this is a fragrance that stands out, in a good way. Some people have said it is a throwback to the 80\'s powerhouse boozy scents with tobacco, patchouli, vanilla, leather, etc. - I can see why. Most people will expect something that smells cheaper than this does...although there are some noticeable synthetic aspects, it is still a fabulous fragrance for the price. It is a very cozy and comfortable scent meant for intimacy. If you are a ""man"", not a boy trying to smell good on a high-school date, wear it. Leave this stuff to the late-20\'s and up crowd and enjoy a nice cigar while this scent is on you. This is a rich skin scent, although it projects well from clothing (so a mix would be advised to get more longevity and sillage). So, it is a closer-in scent as many describe - I also recommend using the great After Shave Splash Lotion or Balm (which is excellent too) with it to increase the potency. This has been around an entire decade and, although I sampled it before, I always went for something else (not sure why). It is less rich than other scents I have - namely, Gucci Pour Homme I (2003) and more sweet than Dirty English, actually a very nice balance between tobacco, patchouli, incense and the boozy plum & dried fruit (excellent harmony).  I see the comparisons with the dried fruit to John Varvatos - but this is more Varvatos Vintage for me. The tobacco is stronger along with the more notable leather. I have all the John Varvatos bottlings (including Artisan and Artisan Black)...love the entire line - and this has some of the better qualities of tobacco, leather, incense, and dried fruits plus patchouli and sandalwood. This is a truly great bottle of juice for a very reasonable price point. Only drawback is that you don\'t get a very long time with it...as most reviews say, about 4-5 hours or so. But, I have to say that sometimes it is better to have a very good scent last for a shorter period of time than a mediocre scent last a long time (which is often the case). That, ironically, is my only issue with John Varvatos - great quality, excellent composition and exquisite chic-ness that lasts about 4 hours as well. After that, you can either reapply or move on to a flanker, which I often do (separates day into night)...or even bring in a new scent with similar aromatics and let it fly. After all, you are left with a very sweet and expressive drydown that is a nice memory - no reason to feel cheated. Michael Kors was the forerunner of where John Varvatos went and it still stands out after a decade. Very Good! Scent - 8.5+/10; Longevity and Sillage - 7.5/10; Overall - 8+/10 for sheer enjoyment! Just like good sex, it doesn\'t last forever, but when it\'s good - it\'s damn good and you think of it often afterward...wanting more. ;-) Absolutely brilliant for winter holiday parties and cozy, cold nights...', 'The 1st time I tried Michael for Men, I thought, ""disgusssting! Who would wear this nasty stuff? Smells like ****!"" Half an hour later, it smelled even worse (if that were possible). Thoroughly displeased, I washed several times to remove all traces of the offending odor. Some weeks later I sampled it again, just to show someone how vile it was. To my surprise, they liked it- a lot. I gingerly sniffed my wrist again, and, what\'s that? That smells great! Note, it HAD dried down over an hour before I smelled it this time. What a difference! Fairly strong sillage, and I can easily detect it the next day. I\'ve grown to really appreciate this scent. I just need to make sure I apply it well before I leave home to let it air out a bit. Anyone else have a similar experience with this one? PS I detect similarities between this and Cartier\'s Pasha; several notes in common from top through mid to base, with more of a dried fruit,tobacco and boozey notes added. The nod goes to Michael over Pasha, though. See my review of Pasha.', ""I went to an independent perfume store and I saw a last 100ml bottle. I asked the saleslady if I can have it test on my skin and she obliged. She sprayed on my wrist pulse and man it smells wonderful. But then I realized that the scent is familiar, it is the same top notes scent I smelled from my Givenchy Very Irresistible for Men but without the dry/dark chocolate note. The saleslady agreed with me since I bought my Very Irresistible from her a week ago. The resemblance remain until its heart but changes slowly by the dry down. Although she's selling it to me at a sale price of $38, I simply let go of it since the fragrance in my skin resembled with Givenchy Very Irrestible for men.  I just found out that Givenchy house made this for designer Michael Kors in 2001, that figures. It is refined, sensual and distinguished. Longevity is 7hours and close to my skin. Sillage in an hour is great. So this is like an older brother of Givenchy Very Irresistible for Men, 2005. Both are fall and winter wearing perfumes. I would have both it if it is a summer fragrance and more unique scent. but who knows, at $38 for 100ml., I might be tempted to buy it , maybe to layer it with Givenchy V.I. and see how it goes."", ""Sweet & Tobacco-ey!

At the base we then finally have somehow an ambery smell ending this scent.', ""It's the booziest frag I own, presenting a very strong note of whiskey / brandy that lasts almost the whole time, unlike Pure Malt, that opens with whiskey but then softens to malt note. Especially in the beginning, it has a little pronounced citrus note, that gives only some personality.  It has a very pronounced and tanned tobacco, a very good one, which gains strength after a few minutes and even more at the dry down. It is also very sweet, with a note of dried raisin and plum which also gains strength over the scent, but it is not very fruity, with some woods that give a more mature and elegant bias, and other spices that also offer some depth. Great fix and projection.  Unlike PM, Michael for men is transparent, but also more complex. As I enjoy incense note, I feel this note here, but almost nobody notices this one. I get many compliments with it, every time I use it. This isn’t a young scent itself, but it is neither an old school one, if you enjoy Egoiste, the M7, The Dreamer and Pure Malt you probably will enjoy this frag."", ""Michael Kors for Men is probably the most comfortable masculine out there. What I mean is, it has coziness and warmth - it just doesn't work at the gym or clubbing. It's like relaxing by the fire on a cold winter night. It's like your favorite blanket. A warm, rich, honeyed tobacco smell with fruits (sort of a cherry aroma) and a little bit of leather create a fragrance to represent relaxation and comfort. It might work on a cold winter day if you're moving around, but otherwise Michael Kors for Men is a fragrance for relaxing at home or somewhere with family, like Thanksgiving dinner. And really, there's nothing wrong with that. It's warm and inviting and lasts a while. The drydown is spectacular, and makes me think of Christmas or something. Now, one more thing - there's a suede-like note in there that, uncannily, reminds me of the fruited suede of Donna Karan's great DK Men (also called Fuel). DK Men is my favorite leather scent, and I can't help but feel somewhat reminded in Michael Kors for Men. I wouldn't say Michael Kors for Men is a suitable alternative to DK Fuel (nothing is), but it's almost as if the rebellious biker in DK Fuel came home, took off his leather, and relaxed in his robe with a pipe.

The smell itself is filled with spicy tobacco and a citrussy element, it screams I AM MAN...HEAR ME ROAR!! LOL. It's got a good strength. Not for me I'm afraid. :("", ""I really liked the strong masculine opening and mid notes of this fragrance. The dry yet boozy accords really makes this a man's cologne. But there were 2 things that really put me off and resulted in my giving this away: 1) Projection gets really weak after around 2-3 hours (yes, its very strong upon spraying for around 30 minutes) and scent lasts around 6 hours, which is a bit lacking for the winter (summer projection/longevity is less of an issue) 2) The warm amber really smells synthetic to me, or perhaps I think it is not blended well enough. Like Burberry London, I had to give this away which was quite unfortunate."", 'Michael for Men is my favorite tobacco dominant fragrance. I love the phase of the fragrance where the tobacco and suede transitions to patchouli, plum/fruits (while always maintaining the dominant tobacco note). The fragrance is very 80ish, as far as presence and sillage is concerned. Longevity is about 6-8 hours on me, but it can still be detected for up to 12 hours. Of all the fragrances I own, Michael for Men makes me feel the ""richest"". ""Rich"" in like ""I\'ve got money-to-burn rich"" (even though I don\'t). It\'s difficult to explain. I have other fragrances that are more elegant, or that are more formal. But Michael for Men makes me feel ""richer"" than any other fragrance that I\'ve tried. Very masculine...very rich...and I\'ve been told, very sexy...', 'Im so mad...this is a great smelling fragrance but it doesnt last at all, a shame because is not cheap...i wont give it away but ill wait till summer cause doesnt last!!! im pissed!!!', 'I don\'t find M7 or Antaeus to be more complex than Michael for Men, but rather simpler, unlike another reviewer. However, I do understand the notion that it has a ""synthetic"" quality. Sometimes I feel this way but other times I don\'t. I think it is due to a powerful, ""modern"" musk, which you won\'t find in the ""power"" fragrances of the 1980s. Obviously, the quality of ingredients is not likely to be on the level of vintage Antaeus. In any case, if you like the idea of a dried fruit/tobacco/patchouli/incense fragrance, you should try this one. If that doesn\'t sound good to you, then just avoid it. It settles down nicely, unlike Bogart Pour Homme, which is similar but I find it to be terribly unbalanced and too simple. Once it settles down, projection (""sillage"") may or may not satisfy you. I think this occurs when the strong musk has mostly dissipated. If you can still smell it at that point, longevity should be very good for you. I wore this quite often a couple years ago but now I find myself drawn to fragrances like Black Walnut, because it doesn\'t have the strong musk that sometimes feels too ""synthetic"" to me.', ""This is such a greAt fragrance, it's very strong, lasts ages, it totally dominates the room. Recommended for middle ages men who like them strong."", 'I found a 4.2 oz. bottle of this at a local department store on the clearance shelf for under 20 dollars. I tried to get the tester bottle too, as it was being phased out at the store.  This has for the present become my signature fragrance. I cannot tell for sure what it is that grabs ahold of me so about this scent, but there is just something about it.', 'I own a couple Michael Kors shirts and his clothing is very well made and even when the designs are simple they are still quite elegant. The same is true with this fragrance. When I first saw this and sniffed it I thought nice but I have other stuff like this and walked away. After reading bamacharm\'s review I thought I owed it another smell, and when I tried it on my skin...o la la!! When you first spray this it is heavy, rich and quite manly. It smells like it has a rich rum or cognac note. The spiciness of cardamom, anise, caraway and corriander should be quite intense but it is actually quite smooth, rounded by the herbal tarragon and fir resin. I can\'t detect the bergamot per se but I\'m sure its helping to smooth this heady mix in the opening. On first try these notes are all I smelled and never got to experience the tobacco and incense notes:earthy and exotic,without the smokiness. This scent is (at the risk of sounding sexist)for men only. This is the ""cigar and brandy after dinner in the library"" type of mens scent, not the actual stale smoke filled room, of course but that all-man ultra masculine type of vibe is echoed here very well I might add. The base in this could have gone another way entirely and had aged woods, leather, etc.,but MK does something very interesting and puts black plum and dried fruit in there, heavenly,sweet and unique. The wood is there as sandalwood is wrapped in a nice patchouli note but the fruitiness offsets the spices and the rich incense and tobacco perfectly. Sexy, daring,elegant and rich this scent has a prescence that is strong yet subdued.It speaks softly but it means every word, surrounds you sweetly but is not cloying and despite the slight fruitiness is never sisssified; a rare quality in colognes and men... Sillage: great Longevity: quite good Overall: 4.5/5 This is the only mens fragrance MK ever released and it is a treasure. The bottle itself is a work of art and for being released in 2001 this fragrance is exceptional and nothing like its contemporaries. An homage to the smoky woody spicy scents of the 70s & 80s yet modern enough for the new millenium...', ""I love this stuff, and I do wear it every day to work. I bought it the first time on a discount shelf, a 4.2oz bottle for $20. They didn't know what they had."", ""Incredibly warm, sensual, boozy, sweet & slightly smokey fragrance. It's a bit scary at first, but within about 10 minutes it settles into a very comfortable boozy tobacco that envelops you all over. Later on, the dried fruit & plum notes really make this stand out from other similar type tobacco/incense scents such as Gucci Pour Homme 1 & D&G's The One for Men (both of which I love by the way). To me it just smells classy & distinguished. Although I love it, I don't think it's an 'everyday use' kind of fragrance, like to the office; more for going to the pub with friends or dinner with someone special. Of course I will also wear it for myself, as when I'm wearing it I can't seem to stop smelling myself.

I was in love at first sniff. Unlike so many mens fragrances it didnt start with a truly citrus opening. Spicy from the get go. I love anything it incense and this has a great incense aroma. The tobacco is refreshing and lasts a long time. Patchouli, sandalwood, and a nice sweet smell settle in for the duration with a hint of the tobacco remaining. VERY MANLY, but not over powering. I am glad I rediscovered it!!!', ""this is such an original scent. it's unique, i mean you can recognize it easily. I like it very much, but this scent is a risky option."", 'Today I convinced my bf to try this one out on the way home from vacation (yay duty free!).  When I took a quick initial whiff from the bottle the first thing to stand out was the Cedar but this was the only time that it took the forefront.  Once sprayed the cologne becomes very smokey, the tobacco was the major stand out for me at this point. I found it very unpleasant and overpowering. After we waited a few minutes longer it became what I think the fragrance set out to be. Very masculine, bold and warm. I think that it would most certainly fit the man that F_A described.  Overall I liked it and found it to be a very lush, sexy scent. I think that if you are looking for an evening/winter scent this one would be worth a shot.', ""Whenever I smell it, i see a man sitting on the leather armchair in the twilight of candles, drinking good old cognac and smoking a good cigar, that's how Michael smells for my nose. One of my favourites men fragrances ever!"", 'Dear Greco.... first of all.... it is nice how we react now :) Than this,,,, i am uesed to Antheus, Egoiste, Aramis, Yatagan. So it is not that i dont like heavy parfumes or heavy concentraited. it is just the scent it self. As i said befor there is a synthetic thing about it. it starts with the dry fruits and honey/ lethery sharpness that doesn;t work on me...still i should be abble to smell the scent it self and how it is made.

Because his eyes are very bad he can't see much. But his nose works quite well. He can smell the incense and tabacco. He loves the fruity drydown. On his skin it is a well blended soft smell. Stays on for hours. Suits colder winter wether very well.  8/10 , nice bottle as well."", ""Michael by Michael Kors is a rich elegant and utterly sophisticated scent for any gentleman of discerning style and taste. Hitting notes of leather, tobacco, and plum it has the feel of tony aristocratic mahogany paneled New York men's clubs, or a brisk walk to the boathouse in Central Park in the golden glow of a late afternoon in autumn. Certainly not for everyone, least of all a kid, this is strictly for a man who knows just who he is and where he is going. Five Gold Stars *****"", ""Michael Kors for Men is probably the most comfortable masculine out there. What I mean is, it has coziness and warmth - it just doesn't work at the gym or clubbing. It's like relaxing by the fire on a cold winter night. It's like your favorite blanket. A warm, rich, honeyed tobacco smell with fruits (sort of a cherry aroma) and a little bit of leather create a fragrance to represent relaxation and comfort. It might work on a cold winter day if you're moving around, but otherwise Michael Kors for Men is a fragrance for relaxing at home or somewhere with family, like Thanksgiving dinner. And really, there's nothing wrong with that. It's warm and inviting and lasts a while. The drydown is spectacular, and makes me think of Christmas or something. Now, one more thing - there's a suede-like note in there that, uncannily, reminds me of the fruited suede of Donna Karan's great DK Men (also called Fuel). DK Men is my favorite leather scent, and I can't help but feel somewhat reminded in Michael Kors for Men. I wouldn't say Michael Kors for Men is a suitable alternative to DK Fuel (nothing is), but it's almost as if the rebellious biker in DK Fuel came home, took off his leather, and relaxed in his robe with a pipe. I'll be rocking this stuff when winter rolls around."", 'One of the ""richest"" scents I have ever smelled in terms of olfactive pyramid and its result on the skin. I must say this comparing with those colognes I see with lots of ingredients in their composition, in which the result is completely linear and simple, to the point of asking myself: “What about those notes A, B, and C that are here, in the pyramid?” In Michael for Men, this is different. It’s about one of those colognes that you can perfectly identify the existent notes and how they work. On my skin, the start is divinely spicy, with a wonderful and soft cinnamon, well blended with the star anise and beautiful notes of coriander and cardamom. The rest (bergamot, tarragon, etc.) I can’t feel with evidence. Its evolution has real notes of creamy tobacco, incense and, the comfortable part of this scent, with the suede. The base is hot and sweet at the same time. I feel sandalwood and plum. The notes of dried fruits are there, but I really don’t know the effect they cause.  The result: a sophisticated, elegant, and masculine scent. It is important to remember that this one was made for a division of Givenchy, what allows me to say with confidence: “now I understand the great quality”. To finish my review, I am going to do something that I am not used to doing, which is point the target of this cologne: I can’t imagine an 18-year-old OR a punk OR a tattooed hunk guy with his CK underwear and his tight t-shirts wearing this cologne and having the proper success. This cologne reminds me of professional environments, formal occasions, and, above all things, men with the posture and attitude of gentlemen.  Median projection with superb lasting. 10 stars!', 'Michael for Men (2001) -  A favorite tobacco forward fragrance that doesn\'t smell like anything else out there as it is both retro and modern all at once. Even the 2014 re-issue has a much different composition, while maintaining only a touch of the original\'s backbone. I really enjoy both versions, but reach for the vintage more often especially in cooler weather.  Fortunately, the vintage is still widely available on-line in 1, 2.5, and 4 oz bottles so check it out while you still can. Michael Kors produces a full line for men today, but in 2001 there was only one choice - ""Michael""... and he got it right the first time. 4 stars.', 'Sweet white tobacco, hints of booze, dried fruits reminiscent of apples and apricots, hints of plum, cinnamon, star anise and blonde leather start things off. Sweetness fades a bit going into the mid notes and dry down where warm spices like cardamom, cinnamon and anise plus some patch begin to dominate. Tobacco darkens a bit, suede and sandalwood notes remain in check. Fit for a well dressed gentleman in a business environment and more appropriate for cooler weather. Projection and sillage are quite good, longevity is average. Score 6.5/10', 'Purchased 1 oz blind of this--glad I didn\'t get more. This is actually very nice, for 30 seconds while the top boozy note eclipses the synthetic tobacco scent. I find that many so-called ""tobacco"" colognes do not smell much like tobacco at all. Instead, they have a mixture of compounds that more closely resemble clove oil. This is also true of Cigar by Remy Latour. The rest of the base is a melange of powerful sweet spices (cinnamon, clove, nutmeg), much like a concentrated potpouree. This is blindingly powerful, and IF I wear it I avoid spraying it on my chest, but rather arms and back of head. I don\'t get the dried fruit at all. I had such high hopes for this, and am sadly disappointed. I do not recommend buying this blind unless you are a big fan of faux tobacco scents. (I smoke cigars and a pipe, I know what real tobacco smells like)', 'Smells like off fruit, calms a little once dried and becomes more refined but the damage is done for me.

Dried fruit and incense, which to me always smells woody, so I interpret this as a fruity-woody scent. Nice!  But Pure Malt it ain\'t. I have a bottle of that. Pure Malt is much more complex and better. The deal-breaker arrives as it dries down about a half hour later - then I get that all too common synthetic note that I associate with the inexpensive scents always found in Ross. It\'s sort of a pungent ""yellow"" note. I suppose it\'s used in perfumery to suggest tobacco. Anyway, I dislike it. It says ""I\'m cheap.""  Projection and longevity is about the usual thing, which is to say disappointing.']"

While there are others that are excellent for specific occasions, this Dunhill X-Centric offers up an extremely versatile frag that feels as comfortable in a suit as in jeans and a camp-shirt. The opening is quite unique, actually. A little bit aquatic, but spiked with a warm peppery note. It dries down musky-woody, but not in the same way that every other drugstore frag does. X-Centric maintains is character, It stays more dry than sweet. Stefan has mentioned that X-Centric smells a lot like Bond No.9 Riverside. There are certainly similarities, especially in the drydown. But Riverside has a more citrus opening and is sweeter overall. I purchased a sample of both to compare, and must say I prefer X-Centric. It\'s just a more distinctive scent. The bottle is very attractive, with it\'s flip-down cap. But the atomizer itself is not very good. It tends to squirt kind of weakly instead of giving a good dispersion.

I was excited to hear that there is a company called Perfume Parlour, here in the UK, that supposedly makes good copies of many fragrances, including Zanzibar. The reviews of other scents they produced seemed to be largely very positive, although there was no review of PP\'s version of Zanzibar. On receipt of their version of Zanzibar, I was VERY disappointed it did not even closely resemble it and it didn\'t even smell pleasant!! I was equally disappointed by their response when I said as much. They said ""It is very unlikely that we would have got the scent wrong as we have sold many of the same and not had a single complaint thus far."" What arrogant b*****ds!! They have got it VERY wrong, so don\'t waste your money on them, as you will be sorely disappointed as I was.

I never realized it is so expensive these days. I got it on ebay as a set with a candle for 7$ shipping included probably two years ago. I also never realized it was for men.  Well, I put maybe eight dabs on myself and I pretty much can't smell anything after 2 hours. I am moving back and forth just to catch a whiff and nothing... It smelled generic oriental-spicy when I was putting it on. Very weird. I smell my shampoo, I smell my detergent when I intentionally move but nothing from Zanzibar.

Though good and invinting, it doesn\'t offer anything really unique.  On my skin, it\'s a short-lived fragrance with a gorgeous citrus/peppery opening act that soon becomes a quiet woody drydown. In my opinion, the pepper never really leaves the stage, but you certainly could expect a little bit more from such interesting brand. I don\'t find the bottle to be astoning at all; it\'s actually quite simple: a plain glass rectangle with a tacky red plastic top. Its main problem must be the spray position, which makes things difficult. An average fragrance with moderate to weak staying power and sillage that doesn\'t really offer a new experience.', 'Jeca summed this up perfectly when she described it as like ""African wind"".  Like Africa it conjures up thoughts of dark wood, heat and spices; yet like the wind it\'s sometimes strong and sometimes fleeting. I do really like this one for a change to my usual Summer rotation of aquatics and fresh fruity scents, but I do wish that the overall initial effect of wood, heat and spice lasted a bit longer. P.S. The bottle\'s gorgeous to look at in person, but the shape and position of the nozzle makes it difficult to use!', ""An honest woody/citrus fragrance with some spices thrown in. Nice opening opposed to a faint woody drydown. Overall Zanzibar smells fine but don't expect something particularly artistic or distinctive. Average quality. Weak lasting power.

I think I may like this even better than the Parfum... Too bad Montana does not make these anymore..', ""I wasn't expecting too much from this. Felt it might be overhyped. But I must say, after a slightly brash cheapish initial opening, it very quickly settles down to something rather delightful. I get a lovely mix of ciruses and florals. Soapy as well. It has depth and for the price I'm enjoying it immensely. Not your usual fare at all."", ""With Montana Homme, we may have some confusion, as its bottle is just a few shades lighter than Parfum d'Homme, but what we have here is quite a different direction, and its quite dashing I must say. A radiant citrus opening with a few sprigs of mugwort to bitter it up like an aperitif, but then it gets powdery and feels like Tang if it were made with much more natural citrus flavor. I used to eat Tang powder right out of the jar when I was a kid. It explains a lot. Anyhow, its like the most beautiful Tang powder mixed with nutmeg. And not to fear, my worshippers at the altar of Evernia Prunastri, the oakmoss is here in spades, along with a whole lot of woods, cedar, sandalwood, you decide..."", 'What I’ll say that hasn’t already been said is this: I put three drops on my wrist Tuesday morning, it is now Wednesday night and I can still smell it a bit when I bring my wrist to my nose… the longevity is wild.', 'DrNDJas in his review below nails it pretty good, and the other reviewers have made very valid and observant points as well. I’ll just add that as the fragrance progresses during the wearing it gets more lovely… the powdery “Tang”-like orange note here is part of an interesting & unique opening but is not the dominant note throughout. Recommended 😌', ""DrNDJas is spot-on, so I'm not going to reinvent the wheel here. I'll just underline (like DrNDJas did in the previous comment) that while Montana Parfum d'Homme (red box) is a fantastic masterpiece-level masculine fragrance, here Montana Homme (blue box) is indeed a cheerful and unpretentious Spring/Summer fragrance. Not essential, but very pleasant. Given its price, I have no regrets on my blind buy, that despite being a simple scent, is pretty unique."", ""I own and love Montana Homme Parfum and was intrigued by this lesser-known offering from this house. First thing to know is that although the bottle is identical, Homme has nothing at all to do with Parfum. Whereas the original is aldehydic, leathery, pine, and floral, this one is primarily bitter orange, pepper and cedar. The orange in this case across quite distinctly from most other times I've experienced it in a fragrance: it is dry, almost chalky rather than juicy, similar to the smell of a powered orange drink before adding water. I believe this effect is achieved with the cedar and pepper accord that sits just under the orange/citric notes. I get some bitterness added by artemisia. Do not allow your mind to reflexively wander to comparisons with TDH based on the woody/orange description- it's more cheerful, lighter, and less serious, ideal for cool to warm weather. This is a unique scent that I am glad to add to my collection."", ""I ordered the red boxed Parfum d'Homme and accidentally got sent this with a blue box. I am not upset with that at all! It has become my most reached for fragrance and I get compliments. It is a creamy, slightly sour bitter orange backed by spices and herbs. Performance is good. You will get noticed wearing this since it's quite different and rare. Just bought the red boxed today and while I haven't fully delved into that one I can say that this, the blue one, has more depth to it."", 'Montana Homme is the second(or third if we count the ""Parfum d\'homme light""edition)install in this towering bottle,but there is little resemblance with the past.This frag is a fresh-flowery-powdery one,a bit elegant,a bit sporty,not so unique,but as usual well made by the great Montana house and the performances are great,also a mark of their name!', 'That’s the fourth Montana I purchase and all have been blind buys so far. While the Parfum d’homme (red box) and Carbone left me a good impression, black edition and this one feel more awkward. One thing I must stress for potential buyers: I first tried to get it from an internet site but I received the red box instead. But the picture and the notes listed were definitely for the blue box. So watch out. After a second try I finally received Montana Homme. Though I find it surprisingly not so common, I don’t like it a lot. There’s plenty of orange and lemon for the beginning. But that first blast is very loud and synthetic, and it goes on and on. I patiently wait for the other ingredients to kick in but nothing really happens. I might be able to go through the bottle by layering. I wanted to like it but it feels kind of cheap.', 'YES! Finally! I have been looking all Summer for a clean, linear citrus that i can call my own.  You would think it would be simpler, but alot of the newer ones ive been trying seem desperate to show they have more than just the citrus thing going on. ""I\'m amber too! I\'m green! I\'m woodsy!"" This is not what i am looking for. Montana Homme fits the bill for me, and has the advantage of being less commonly found so i can use it knowing no other guys around are rocking it. While I\'m sure some of you can think of a more accurate interpretation of linear citrus (suggestions welcomed,) the top 3 notes for me out of the gate are white grapefruit, bitter orange, and lemon. The miracle is that while the notes are bright, they are not acrid or sharp in any way. My only complaint is that its longevity is seriously lacking. Multiple sprays and its almost gone in an hour. Seems like they knew that because the sprayer delivers a massive amount with one spray. Ends up working out. --Blue box with bottle shaped cutout center, smoked grey glass with matching plastic cap in \'Tower of Babel\' shape, made in france, parfums Claude Montana, batch code 31111', 'Smells much like Quorum - but a version leaning towards warm/hot weather because of the ramped up lemon. Performance (sillage especially) is very good for several hours. Highly recommended!', ""This review is for Montana Homme in the RED BOX!I love this scent,I love the bitter citrus note mixed with woody scents.This is a masculine scent,I can't imagine a woman would want to wear a frag with such a bitter citrus scent but never say never;this is a for Fall smell to my senses to be worn before and after a good rugby game! I would not blind buy unless its a mini,just to get to know the fragrance.I love the bottle design , also the Montana Homme in the BLUE box is a completely different scent that is sweeter and soapier,but on dry down on MY skin goes pungent and unpleasant as far as I'm concerned!"", 'It is a happiness and well-being potion for men. Smells classic, clean, elegant while complex at the same time. Nothing compares to it. It can be worn for any occasion and at any age : a real magic.', ""Just bought my second bottle today and that too from a small shop i got the first time round!-clean, fresh, lingering scent. Really cheap for the quality..partly because the younger and impressionable generation don't know about this, so let's keep it that way! ;-)"", 'very nice blended classic edt. with a wonderful bergamote-pepper opening than a spicy-iris heart and completly different warm and embracing musk-sandalwood drydown... i can really notice 3 classic phases!!! it can be either a daytime or a nighttime fragrance because it transforms... ok...maybe not groundbreaking milestone... maybe a ""light"" projection but a very decent staying-power!!!', ""Great scent for warm weather. If you already have Cerruti 1881 for men, you will not get much from Montana for men. The differente will be in the opening, when Montana is more citric than Cerruti. In its middle and base notes Montana has 6 notes (out of 10) in common with the middle and base notes of Cerruti. Thus in the drydown both are similar (not identical, because the pine of Cerruti and the amber of Montana holds a difference till the end). Of both I recommend Cerruti because, in my opinion, its complexity, sillage and longevity are superior to Montana's."", ""Superior once again, this is a noble scent. I can't believe when I first received, there is no other scent like it, true as it described the lemony notes but never expected this good. I must say, montana though long gone and I guess teens nowdays are not familiar with the brand as I am back in 90's and reunite the brand once again here in my closet. Montana deserve 10/10"", ""Montana is true classic, chic and prestigious. This is not available in my country now, long time ago it was, the clothing and perfumes found in most stores, now gone. Despite the bottle design which resemble the tower of babel, the content is serious. I'm getting the black edition and homme, I cannot wait. I hope it's just as good as the late parfum d'homme, packaged in red box and green bottle."", 'I find this one very different to the female version, much more green,less barroque,isnt a bad one,but not memorable either, anyway,not a bad one', 'Love this one. A little bit simple and too lemony at first, but this is all about the dry down for me. Dries down to a wonderful, clean, slightly soapy, slightly floral (geranium?) smell. Fresh and beautiful rather than overtly masculine - just enough herbs late on to keep it gently masculine. Definitely a spring/summer fragrance. Subtle but nicely balanced - quietly complex compared to a lot of citrus fragrances. Projects softly after the strong lemon top notes. Longevity is good - 8+ hours on me.  Fresh, subtle and lovely.', 'Marvellous perfume. Funnily enough I got it by mistake. I was sent the wrong perfume. It does not smell masculine at all, it does smell rather feminine. It is in fact a floral perfume. The lemon scent is only in the opening and what remains as that sort of citric perfume is not lemon but geranium, whose smell is very similar to lemon, but without the acidity, in fact it is floral lemon. This perfume is nevertheless sweeter and fresher than geranium on its own, and the herbs are slightly noticeable, but by far the dominant note here, after the lemony opening, is geranium. It is all about this flower. The perfume was even nicer when I was wearing it than smelled directly from my skin. Wearing it sent me sky high. And I do not usually like masculine perfumes. But this one is amazing. Sillage and longevity are also very good.', 'its master piece in world of perfumes', 'Excellent fragrance Very citric and refreshing .

It never really had any bright top notes, but it just smelled ""old"". This is not a blue scent. It is a green scent. The fig and cucumber are the star. Combined with the woodsy notes and musk, it smells exactly like celery and orange juice. I am wearing it right now. At times, it smells rancid and I want to scrub it off. But beneath that musty celery/orange juice vibe is a pleasing mix of fruits that do remind me of what it once was. If made with better ingredients and minor tweaking, this could be amazing. Not sure if it got reformulated or if both batches I got turned bad along the way, but this is now a PASS IMO. It does not last too long and has decent sillage, but I would wear it outside\' it would be better to catch whiffs of it in the wind. I will keep this bottle to spray every now and then for when I want some nostalgia.', 'This is a very tart, citric, sour ""fresh"" fragrance. There isn\'t fruit anything than the sour citrus blasted from the top notes. A mint vibe emerges and we are left with woody feel. If you enjoy citrus fragrances, you might enjoy this. Otherwise, there are plenty of better citrus and fruit juicy fragrances out there like Blue Seduction/Cerruti No 4/D&G Light Blue pour Femme/Versace Eau Fraiche/etc.', 'I was curious about this one because a reviewer suggested it has a drydown similar to an expensive niche scent (and it does have a bit of that quality). When I saw it a a really low price and I needed something to add to my order to get free shipping, I decided to buy a bottle. The fig leaf and mint notes also were a reason for the ""blind buy,"" because that combination sounds like it might be unique (to me). Some have said begins with a strong fruity quality and then becomes very weak. I had the opposite experience, that is, the fruity quality is not too strong and it holds its complexity and is reasonably strong in the drydown. I\'d guess there is some vetiver and woods supplying the structure, and overall it has a dynamic quality, with several elements in play. Unfortunately, the notes aren\'t as articulated as I would like in the drydown. I do find it pleasant and interesting, but it\'s not for those who want a ""young"" and ""fresh"" scent, as it has a bit of a ""dark side."" If this were to be classified as a ""vetiver scent,"" actually, it might be my favorite, though I dislike strong vetiver notes (and don\'t get clear/strong mint nor fig leaf). There is a bit of a ""chemical"" aspect, that is if you find dry, woody type aroma chemicals to be not entirely natural smelling. It\'s not nearly as bad as I have found this quality to be in so many niche scents, though, and I would rather wear this than something like Dune Pour Homme. On the other hand, if I could choose between this and Aramis\' Bermuda Tonic, I\'d choose BT.', 'I have had a bottle of this for a few months now. It\'s a bit baffling for me, and not at all what I expected when I purchased it as a blind buy. I picked it up cheaply at a going-out-of-business sale, expecting an aquatic fragrance suitable for summer. But the blue color and Ocean Pacific label are misleading: this is a very ""green"" scent.  It is a slightly weird combination of vetiver and fig leaf. I thought that I just wasn\'t picking up the intended notes, until my teenaged son smelled it and asked ""Why would anyone make a celery fragrance?"" Exactly the note I was always detecting! My guess is that it has something to do with the fig leaf ingredient (I have no clue what an actual fig leaf smells like) but it might also emanate from the cucumber listed in the note pyramid. To sum up: it is not a bad fragrance, but to my nose (and my son\'s) it is just too weird to wear. Sillage is moderate, and it lasts quite a few hours. The sprayer is unlike any other I have seen either, considering that the spray shoots up from the top of the bottle: hold it vertically and you can get a blast in your eyes.

Rococo for Men is the best kept secret (and I selfishly wonder if I should even spread the word here). A scent that has its focus on black pepper, a green note of what I receive as Boston Ivy, juniper berries, and a fresh ginger note (much like Yves Rocher Eryo, which I reviewed yesterday). This results in a unique accord that feels almost like what I've found in classic older Annick Goutal releases; a nuanced, stark beauty that belies the reputation of Joop! fragrances. A linalool-heavy heart, most likely represented by the freesia note in the pyramid, gives a feel of almost rosewood, while the dry down is a Poivrol (a peppery-wood aromachem) with a mildly sweet ambery accord. Much like What About Adam?, Rococo for Men deviates from the mainstream template of its time, introducing a mid-line designer that pushed the limits of perfume artistry. We can all agree this seldom results in commercial success and an eluded consumer unable to wrap their head around the scent.

It reminds me a little of Bvlgari Blv with the citrus/ginger settling into ambery woods. This has more of a rotten mandarin note which is darker and warmer and the woody notes are remarkably like pencil shavings.

The initial whiff of bright and juicy citruses rounded out with spices like nutmeg immediately made me think of Aventus Absolu. Not that they\'re similar at all, but the way this scent is ""constructed"" so to speak reminded me of the Creed. As the scent dries down it becomes more aromatic, but the citruses are still pretty present. It\'s an extremely likeable and easy to wear fragrance, and it\'s also blended excellently. I\'m very excited to try 1872 Mandarin, I have a sample of that coming in soon. Performance is underwhelming unfortunately. It projects moderately for around 2 hours but sillage is on the light side. Longevity is meh, it\'s been 5 hours since I sprayed it on and it\'s almost completely gone. Iconic Masculine and Timeless have much better longevity, as those managed to last 8 hours on skin. I seem to go nose blind easily to this style of citrus-woody fragrances, so there\'s always the possibility that it might be affecting my experience with longevity.

You’ve just stepped into a Savile Row tailor shop in the late 1800s. Someone offers you Earl Grey. There’s a grandfather clock ticking in the background. You’re not wearing cologne… you’re wearing lineage. The top notes come in crisp and green, with a citrus burst so sharp and clean it feels like you shaved your face with a lemon made of diamonds. We’re talking bergamot, lime, petitgrain—the works. It’s fresh, it’s uplifting, and it absolutely does not belong anywhere near a tracksuit. As it dries down, 1872 reveals layers like a Victorian novel. The heart turns herbal and spicy, with a bit of clove, pepper, and a whisper of neroli and rosemary, all wrapped up in an elegant vetiver base. There’s also a nice touch of cedar and moss—just enough to say, “Yes, I do own a globe bar.” This isn’t for the club. It’s for the boardroom, a jazz lounge, or a mysterious rendezvous involving silk gloves and confidential documents. It’s the smell of a man who irons his pocket squares and knows how to sabre a champagne bottle. Now, let’s talk performance—because at this price point, it better behave. Longevity? Solid 8 to 10 hours. This gentleman doesn’t pop in—he stays for dinner, dessert, and a cigar on the veranda. Projection? Classy but noticeable. You won’t gas anyone out, but they will want to know what you’re wearing. Mass Appeal? Surprisingly high… if you’re around people with taste. It’s refined, grown-up, and smells expensive. Because it is. Scent profile? Fresh citrusy fougère with old-money energy. Final Verdict: Longevity: 9/10 (lasts longer than a royal marriage) Scent: 9.2/10 (a green citrus masterpiece in a tailored suit) Mass Appeal: 7.5/10 (not for Gen Z hypebeasts—but your boss will love it) Projection: 8/10 (gentlemanly presence with zero arrogance) Smells like: James Bond after a meditation retreat and a light citrus brunch.', 'Classic old school citrus fougere in the same realm of Eau Sauvage and Casamorati Fiero.', ""It's a masculine fresh modern fougere. Green, lemony and aftershave comes to mind. Absolutely no way in he'll this smells like female hairspray, the reviewer who said that must be confused. This fragrance has weak longevity and sillage.

This makes EDT look like extrait lol - but it smells awesome. Still worth a buy - just drown yourself in it! haha Edit: So I bit the bullet and purchased a bottle. What I would say is it's actually stronger than the tester. I wouldn't say longevity is much of an issue as the spray is very pronounced on the real bottle - ie: two sprays made me cough for a sec.

It’s a beautifully smooth and gentle take on a classical aromatic fougere - oozing with class and elegance at every turn. It’s bright, citric and slightly herbal, but manages to perfectly balance any sharpness with just as much smoothness. Citrus is the name of the game here - lime, grapefruit, mandarin and bergamot in perfect harmony, with sweeter touches coming from pineapple in the background. From here, the aromatic herbal side begins to shine; petitgrain, lavender, rosemary and sage in all their glory. There’s a subtle note of fuzzy peach which again adds a fruity sweetness, but also smooths everything out with its creamy nature. This is basically the bulk of the scent profile, there are some woods and florals present but they aren’t hugely detectable. Overall I think this is wonderful - it’s not the most complex or impressive fougere I’ve ever smelled, but it’s simply so satisfying and enjoyable to wear.', 'Great masculine scent, could be perfect for a signature scent. To me, this smelled pretty much identical to New York Intense by Nicolai, so I sold my bottle of 1872 as it came short on longevity.', 'Review based on a recently purchased (June 2024) 50ml bottle. Huge citrus opening that dries down to a beautiful grassy, floral, fruity and woody scent. Lots going on here. Initial projection is huge but it quickly mellows out. This is a gorgeous warm weather scent for any occasion… summer wedding, the office, casual night out, etc. For this style of fragrance, it lasts quite well. Definitely leans masculine but I could see anyone potentially pulling this one off. I wouldn’t consider this a true “barbershop” scent but it does have a bit of that style in the background. But 1872 is also nothing like Polo Green (as mentioned in other reviews) IMO. 1872 is much fresher, more citrusy and lighter than Polo. 1872 is reminiscent of Creed Royal Water and TF Costa Azzura but I much prefer 1872 over either. I don’t find 1872 dated at all as it comes across as more modern to me. 1872 is beautifully made and the recent releases smell/perform as well as older bottles I have tried over the years. Expensive for sure, but $150-ish for 50ml thru discounters isn’t awful for this level of quality IMO. Highly recommended for anyone that is looking for something special and a bit different for the summer.', 'Blind bought this fragrance as I read many reviews going over how the style is similar to the classic barbershop fougere. Always intrigued by the classic timeless styles in fashion I decided to pull the trigger.  Scentwise it’s amazing. Opens up beautiful and citrusy, woody, crisp, zesty and smooth. As it progresses some of the citrus peters out a bit and it is rounded out in to lavender, wood, amber, and floral. It stays consistently woody and citrusy throughout its life, ultimately receding in to a calming musk.  It smells like New York Intense and Royal Water combined with its own uniqueness swirled in. It really is a timeless and classic scent which would be a staple of mine and top 5. Sadly, and surprisingly the performance isn’t as great as I thought it would be. And compared to other CC I own. It starts off nice and strong, but after 4-5hours its sillage and bubble does drop fairly suddenly. This, like I said, surprises me as all the Clive Christians I own are so strong in performance lasting over 10+ hours and usually 24.  But for 6 hours it gets the job done really well.  Overall it’s a glorious scent. But for the cooler months if you’re a fan of this style try Bois Du Portugal.

Shukran Habibi!', 'You’ve probably smelled a similar scent before while getting a haircut at the barbers, and I don’t mean to pass the comparison to a “barbershop” style fragrance. It’s that slightly sweet, dryish, mossy and slightly dirty, wet(isn’t it amazing that a perfume can smell both dry and wet at the same time?), fresh-cut hair smell mixed with the metal of the shears in the hand of the barber. I can’t remember if that came from a hairspray or a soap used, but it’s very similar. It’s very good. I’m happy this scent was made into a long lasting, quality fragrance. It is indeed similar to Acqua Di Gio(but with mostly natural ingredients), and a note comparison will tell you why. Less oceanic, more herbal and natural, and much more refined.', 'A more sophisticated, luxurious polo green. Just get polo green. Really could only see myself wearing this at a special event.', 'This fragrance has a pleasant and stylish smell, with a harmonious blend of green notes that give it freshness and elegance. There is a sense of luxury in its rich aroma, giving the impression of an expensive and sophisticated product. This perfume is a safe blind purchase as it is sure to please many. The only drawback is its longevity (and price, of course), which did not meet my expectations. The fragrance lasts for about three hours, after it becomes barely detectable on the skin. Smell 10/10, bottle 11/10, longevity 6/10 (but I have to say it stays a little longer on your skin than average fresh summer scent), price 2/10. Overall, I rate it 8 out of 10. Upd: I just realised if you want an alternative for better price, buy tom ford costa azzura (100$ for 50 ml), better longevity and smells pretty same', 'It’s dry, green and elegant. In the opening notes, you’re hit with a fresh burst of citrus, grapefruit and petitgrain which resembles freshly cut grass. As it settles, the heart reveals a classic blend of green hues and flowers. It lasts easily through an entire day with moderate to strong sillage. You won’t need to bathe in it, just a couple of spritzes will do. It’s fresh enough for daytime wear but best suited for a summer wedding, a formal dinner or an important meeting where you want to leave an impression. The oakmoss in the drydown adds a dry layer of earthy, forest-like depth, making it feel like you’re wrapped in an old-money gentleman’s club vibe.', 'This is the cologne that you want to wear if you are wearing a suit. It would seem strange when paired with anything casual.', ""This makes you smell like a Mediterranean citrus farmer after a long day grooming your trees. You are covered in leaf clippings and finally relaxing with a fragrant lemonade.  I typically don't like green fragrances but gave this a shot because it was on sale for over $200 off. I must say this is the exception for me. This made me realize I typically dislike green fragrances because they are too sharp, synthetic, fresh and/or aromatic. This is just pure natural smelling green with a citrus touch. Very classy, non-intrusive and the right amount of fresh. Performance was ok, was nearly gone after 8 hours. I'm used to oud fragrances that last forever but 8 seems decent for a green fragrance. I wouldn't pay retail price for this."", ""Clive Christian 1872: A Fragrant Touch of Sophistication for the Discerning Gentleman Clive Christian 1872 isn't just a cologne, it's an olfactory experience. This luxurious fragrance transcends the realm of everyday scents and enters the world of the truly ethereal. Airy Elegance for the Boardroom and Beyond The first impression you get with 1872 is one of crisp sophistication. A blend of citrus notes, particularly bergamot and grapefruit, creates an invigorating and light start. This isn't a heavy, overpowering cologne. Instead, it infuses the air with a subtle elegance that speaks of confidence and quiet power. The heart of the fragrance is where 1872 truly shines. Here, floral notes of lavender and freesia weave their magic, adding a touch of unexpected depth without losing its essential masculinity. The base of cedarwood and sandalwood provides a grounding earthiness, ensuring the scent remains sophisticated throughout the day. Perfect for Power Plays 1872 is the ideal fragrance for the discerning gentleman who appreciates the finer things in life. Whether you're teeing off with a potential client on a sunny afternoon or making a grand entrance at a corporate soiree, this cologne creates an aura of success and accomplishment. It's the perfect accessory for those moments when you need to project confidence and leave a lasting impression. A Note on Performance Clive Christian 1872 is an Eau de Parfum, a fragrance concentration known for its superior longevity. A single spritz in the morning will ensure you smell fresh and sophisticated throughout the day. The sillage, or scent trail, is moderate, ensuring you won't overwhelm the room but will leave a pleasant and intriguing trace in your wake. Luxury Comes at a Cost Be prepared to invest in excellence. Clive Christian 1872 is a premium fragrance, and the price tag reflects that. However, for the discerning gentleman who appreciates quality and olfactory artistry, the cost is a worthy investment. In Conclusion Clive Christian 1872 is more than just a cologne; it's a statement. It's the fragrance of a man who has arrived and isn't afraid to show it. With its ethereal blend of citrus, florals, and woods, 1872 is perfect for the boardroom, the golf course, or anywhere you want to leave a lasting impression of sophistication and success."", 'Classic and the wood is great', ""When I first sprayed 1872 I was immediately reminded of older batches of Bois du Portugal, except 1872 seems to me to be a step up in quality with much more going on. Since I really like Bois du Portugal, this is a love for me. (For those whom BdP smells dated or for old men, have no fear - this is thoroughly modern.) It starts with a bright, tart citrus/pineapple/petitgrain note that hangs around for nearly the whole wearing. As it dries down it stays zesty, fresh, citrusy, grassy, herbal with a mild woody/resinous base. The blending is simply fantastic. It's classy. It's quality. It could be a signature scent. It is very versatile - it could be worn year-round, but works best in spring, summer and fall. You can wear it to the office, to family gatherings, and to church. My only gripe is that the projection leaves a bit to be desired after the first hour or so, but 1872 does cling to me for around 10 hours as a very noticeable skin scent. Those who come into close contact with you will definitely smell it. And, as with all Clive Christian scents, do not pay retail price as you can find these at discounters. 1872 is one of the best cologne style fragrances for men, and among the best fragrances I've ever smelled."", 'Refreshing barbershop type of scent with a lot of citruses with a musky and mossy base underneath.

If you like black phantom and are looking for a green scent, i would definitely get this.', ""1872 For Men by Clive Christian is the undisputed king of citrus freshness, and here's why it reigns supreme in my collection. From the get-go, the top notes hit hard with a symphony of petitgrain, lime, grapefruit, bergamot, lavender, rosemary, peach, pineapple, galbanum, mandarin orange, pepper, and nutmeg. It's not just a fragrance; it's an explosion of citrus vitality that wakes up the senses with an unmistakable masculine punch. As it unfolds, the middle notes bring in the cavalry with clary sage, tagetes, cyclamen, freesia, and jasmine. It's not just about the initial burst; it's a journey that evolves, keeping the freshness alive and dynamic. Now, let's talk about the base – Virginia cedar, musk, olibanum, amber, patchouli, and French labdanum. It's not just a fleeting experience; it's a fragrance that lingers, leaving a trail of sophistication and masculinity. What sets 1872 apart is its ability to balance the crispness of citrus with a complexity that keeps it from being just another fresh scent. It's like a crisp breeze that carries the essence of timeless elegance and bold masculinity. In a world filled with citrus aromatics, 1872 For Men by Clive Christian isn't just a favorite; it's the benchmark. It's the scent that I reach for when I want to make a statement – fresh, masculine, and undeniably refined. It's not just a fragrance; it's a declaration of timeless sophistication that stands tall in the realm of citrus freshness."", 'Very expensive but perfect ✨', ""Smells really good in my opinion, a complex and mature smell. At first I was skeptical but after letting it sit on my skin for 10-20 minutes it started to smell very nice. Only thing I have a issue with now is I'm a younger guy and this is a complex and mature scent so wearing this out or wearing this around women I would hate to get bad feedback just because it's a mature scent. Still love and and most defiantly will be wearing it out especially this upcoming spring. Also might save this for formal settings in the spring and summer time as I go through college to appear more sophisticated. I would recommend to defiantly get a sample and not to blind buy because it is complex but overall a fresh sophisticated scent for the warmer months.. I will say 8.4/10"", 'Starts out very sharp and fresh, almost abrasive. It maintains a citrusy, floral, and soapy character throughout the life of the scent.

I am very impressed with the quality of the fragrance, especially when compared to my more recent 7.5ml travel atomiser. The fragrance is a very complex freshie that has above average performance.

If that’s your thing, this can be your grail. Otherwise, steer clear.', 'Lots of sour citrus to start. Very masculine leaning. Awesome for spring and early summer for sure. More casual in my opinion.

Nothing overwhelming or ""Must Own"". Enjoy!', ""Absolutely beautiful spring/summer fragrance that is very, very close to Creed's Royal Water. This one seems to haver a longer season to be worn, however it disappoints in that it disappears rather quickly. Too quickly for the cost. Thus, the value is not there for me. It would be great for someone who likes to wear multiple fragrances in one day without having to layer."", ""First, I get an overwhelming black pepper with several citrus fruits and petitgrain that blend together into one CITRUS and multiple herb notes into one HERB. After a few minutes the pepper pulls back a little, and the various citrus and green notes begin to appear more clearly, though I keep getting different notes here and there. Then the citrus pulls back a bit, too and the florals and the fruits become more clear, though the petitgrain never really goes away, keeping this masculine. An hour and a half in and the cedar, amber and musk are in full play, and the full drydown still holds the pepper, along with some slightly sweet notes, green notes, powdery florals and musk with the cedar and amber. Not quite barbershop, but also not modern, either. Well crafted and more complex than my nose can really detect. I get about 1-2 feet projection depending on weather -- high heat = more. This lasts about 4 hours, then it scales back to under a foot for me and stays close to the skin for another 4-6 hours for me. It's pretty complex for a warm weather scent, and even on the warmest day I don't find this cloying. I'm not against expensive fragrances -- all fragrances have insane markups. I have multiple Clive Christian fragrances (discounters, not retail), but when it's all said and done, it's hard for me to pull the trigger on any aromatic fragrance at this price point (or anything fresh, or barbershop for that matter), even the price of deeply discounted testers. I will happily use the rest of my sample and would keep this or the three bottle set (1872, X, No.1) if it was gifted to me, but right now I don't see myself paying for this."", ""When this settles down, it smells very close to Royal Water. It is a green fresh spicy scent. It is definitely interesting to smell, or get a whiff every now and then, but I wouldnt want to smell this constantly. Between this one and Creed's Royal Water, I would go for the latter because of the better opening. 7/10"", ""A high quality and classic fresh fragrance with suprisingly complexity/layers for this genre. I honestly wasn't expecting this to reinvent the wheel, but the way they built this and how it presents itself on skin shows skill. Citrus and petigrain with flashes of fresh fruit, flashes of fresh florals, flashes of spices and lavender, sitting on a base of musk, woods, etc. Excellent 👌 Here's the problem with this and others from the house in my experience; they are all overpriced. The ingredients themselves are great, but we're not talking about super expensive materials like real oud etc, and they use the same aroma chemicals that cheaper perfumes use. Clive Christian has a reputation of being expensive for the sake of being expensive. I found performance to be average on my skin, and a little better than average on my clothes. 400 is way too much to ask for 50ml. If I find a heavily discounted genuine bottle on the secondary market, I'd grab this one for maybe 100-130 tops.  Geza Schoen really brought the heat when he built 1872, but this isn't worth selling a kidney 🤑 If you can find it for a great price, you'll be happy.  Scent 8.8/10 Performance 6/10"", ""Nice.

I sleep better at night knowing that fools are willing to part with a king’s random for what is a mediocre (not bad at all) perfume. Its a form of income redistribution. Please expand the marketing budget and double the price and sales will probably quadruple. Perhaps some Sowarovski embellishments will lift the bottom line a tad more?', ""This opens with a spicy verdant blast, which may feel old school to many. I can pick out lime, grapefruit, galbanum, pepper, nutmeg, and cardamom. This explains the old school vibe, rich and diverse. As it develops, dark floral and herbal notes appear including a very dry lavender, sage, cloves, cyclamen and turmeric. The effect is earthy, only slightly sweet, more like a dried potpourri. The base is a clean musk with touches of incense and patchouli, I'd argue sandalwood, leather and vetiver too. The twist is a lack of any animal notes, which typically support this type of composition in the old school fragrances. The overall impression I get from this in the open is very reminiscent of the Egyptian musk oil girls wore in the 90's. Not quite as hippie as the patchouli oils of the time and a conundrum of slightly sweet, spicy, resins, herbs, and floral wrapped in a warm musk. The drydown is peppery and spicy with a distinct clove note and the musk linger, only slightly sweet and powdery. Plenty of overlap with L for men, which is more dry and woody in comparison."", ""Starts simply amazing, this is one of the perfumes that you'd fall in love while trying in the store then buy. And then maybe regret.  Because after like an hour goes by, the great citrus-green opening starts to fade down dramatically and for my taste, an unnecessarily lot of floral aspects start to emerge, changing the vibe of the feel. This is also when it loses a great deal of strength and become a kind skin scent. Despite changing focus from the fantastic opening, overall liked 1872 for men but with this price, it's not a buy for me."", 'Very similar to Amouage Portrayal. Portrayal is same smell but with added bits of powdery sweetness. 1872 is more masculine. Amouage gives you more juice with better performance.

The price point made me hesitate on a full bottle, but wow, this perfume is amazing! Much better in the FB than the sample. Very fresh, green, citrus, slightly floral, and a lovely woody base. The performance and durability is above average. 1872 performs as you would desire from a sophisticated classy scent. Immediately received two compliments within a couple hours of my first wearing. It's not like any other fragrance in my collection. So beautiful! So refreshing! My 17 year old son loves wearing 1872 and says it's his favorite from my collection.

(The price was a bit lower than one 50 ml bottle of 1872) That is perfect for someone like me whose life isn't noble enough to warrant everyday use of any of these excellent scents, and because of how little you need to spray and how sparingly you (probably) will use them 10 ml will last a long time."", 'It was long lasting on my skin and I got quite a lot of petigrqin and some fruits, and came across as mature.

At some point I had to really try to understand why that is... See, this fragrance has so many things going on at once - citrus, green notes, woods and even a little bit of spice for good measure. And it's all very strong too... Basically, this perfume will make sure you'll stand out in busy and chaotic circumstances - it is the lead role in a melodramatic play, it is the lead singer of a glam rock band and I realized that most of life's everyday events aren't bombastic enough to warrant this fragrance. That's when it struck me... This is a wedding fragrance.  The bride has a much adorned flashy elegant dress, the groom has this. Pair this with a navy blue suit and wear it to your spring outdoor wedding - you will be a star. And then the special occasion will also justify the price :) ... No, cheaper fragrances don't do the same job this does - not its drama and larger than life sense. But that's also why you won't wear this everyday. Don't buy a big bottle - a small one will do.

I was worried, I find people bag CC when all I have tried or bought has been in fact a stand out and worthy (almost) of its price point and product. Some lambasting the brand - why so much hate? Well, firstly, a scent of in simplistic terms a fresh green citric aromatic is always hard to do without it morphing dramatically into something different and underwhelming and or offering abysmal longevity etc etc. Here, no problems - awesome! A buoyant syrupy sweet slightly tart petit grain accentuates the lime and fruit on top and is absolutely brilliantly bodied out by lavender, flowers, nutmeg etc and all the other base notes in effect themselves extremely hard to discern but basically doing their complimentary support job of providing a long serving lime and citrus fresh perfume. It’s very close to Green Jeans though this has a slight middle skew of light florals where as GJ was about the coriander. So, this would sit on my rare shelf of killer citrus scents like Houbigant Duc D’Vervin L’Extreme, Tres Bien Institute Cologne L’Italien, Jacques Fath Green Water EDP and vintage EDT, acqua Di Parma Colonia Club and Tom Daxons Cologne Absolu. Not one of them the same… in fact I get occasional whiffs that remind me of Houbigant Cologne Intense… Edit: I’m reeling in my suggestion about the dry down… it tends to fade a fair bit between two and five hours to an oily residue and closely resembles Cologne L’Italien and definitely the slightly off putting green tarragon finish of Houbigant Cologne Intense - so not a great performer in longevity but when it does work it’s gorgeous and this does seem to be in the cold. Ironically this means Green Jeans as an EDT last longer!  Can anyone give me another alternative to Green Jeans?', '1872 for Men is a complex citrus lavender scent with notes that are typical of mid-18th Century fragrances that were devised to move fragrance on from what had already been done with classic cologne waters like 4711 original and Jean Marie Farina Extra Vielle. In this case, Clive Christian, a house mostly known for making scents distinguished more by their wild prices than by their stupendous smells, is clearly attempting to create a veneer of historical authenticity for itself by referencing the venerable English luxury fragrance house, The Crown Perfumery, which Christian acquired at the start of its operations. The crown caps on Christian\'s bottles reference this bit of history. So does the year 1872--the year Crown Perfumery began business. This scent is a chypre, in terms of structure, and it is built from natural materials all of which were used by Crown in their first scents. But there were no chypre scents in 1872, so this scent\'s historical patina is fake. The stuff in the bottle, however, is really good. The blending here is among the best you\'ll find anywhere and the ingredient quality is unmatched. This fragrance is what an ultra high end chypre might have smelled like in 1872 (if there was such a thing then) and if early 21st Century perfume trends were in force back then. As such, this fragrance is essentially the most refined, elegant, smooth \'freshie\' money can buy. The citrus opening is exceptional and is one of the few places in this scent where a single note can be picked out of the blend. In this case, that note is lime. Later, a fruity lavender note joins the citruses. Florals, minty and green, come along in the heart of the scent and the base is a musky blend of woods and amber accords with a hint of dirty patchouli. It is all clean, fresh and uplifting and succeeds without reliance on ambroxan or other current aromachemicals. This fragrance is genuinely excellent. Now to the big question: is it worth the exorbitant prices for which 1872 is offered to smell this way. I would say, emphatically, ""no!"" I got my bottle from a discount website, which improves the price/value relationship a bit, but the price of even the small (1.6 oz) bottle was still very high for what you get from 1872. I like this fragrance a lot, but not so much that I feel good about what I spent to buy it. You, or course, may feel differently. Bottom line: 1872 is an elegant, fresh, warm weather, daytime fragrance with exceptional quality that is ultra expensive. If you get a chance, sample 1872. You may love it and decide to bear the cost to have it. But don\'t blind buy 1872 even if you see it deeply discounted, I already made that mistake so you don\'t have to.', 'I like it...Smells fresh. 7.7/10', ""-Reminiscent of men’s hair products.

Interestingly enough it kinda reminds me of Fougere Royal by Houbigant. I think it’s that similar almost powdery aromatic note. However, where the Houbigant is sharp and aromatic, 1872 has those aspects turned down. In place there some lightly floral woodiness which meld with the aromatics to support an almost juicy deep fruitiness. The wood / aromatics / soft hints at florals surround and reign in the fruity aspects which keeps the fragrance from ever escaping elegance.  The overall effect is a modern, wearable, masculine juicy citrus peach fragrance with that’s rooted in classic men’s fragrances. It’s a hard to describe fragrance because of the amount of notes. Obviously, price make this an automatic no buy for most folks. However, with some hunting you can find this at steep discount. You can certainly find decant at reasonable prices and in such a case I’d highly recommend this fragrance. It’s long lasting with moderate to heavy sillage.

It smells like what Benetton Colors smelled like 30 years ago. True story...', 'An authorized CC store decided to quit carrying the brand, and they cut prices in half. Combining with some coupon codes and rewards points, I purchased 4 from the brand (this, No. 1, Rock Rose, and X) for much more relatively reasonable prices because I doubted I\'d ever get an opportunity to get shady eBay-like deals from a real boutique--no worry of authenticity or spoilage. Got a 50 mL for $157.50, normally $350. I feel like that\'s worth mentioning. Onto the presentation! The box is exactly what you\'d expect a bottle with a crown for a cap to come in. Overdone, but neat--just neat enough to where you can\'t throw it away, even though you\'ll never use it again. Now I\'ve got four of them sitting around. What a shame! The bottle itself is really pretty. The details are nicely done, such as the the high-quality sprayer that can really control well how much you want to spray. The cap is really heavy! I imagine it\'s solid brass perhaps? It makes it feel like a luxury product. Inside the cap, the CC logo is engraved, which goes to show the level of detail. The smell is quite good. It\'s very sophisticated and unique. It\'s green, but retains just the perfect level of citrus. It\'s clean, but not really in a soapy way. It\'s fresh, but not super sweet. It draws me in, and every time I\'m ready to 2nd, 3rd, and sometimes 4th sniff because it\'s such an unique and gorgeous blend! It\'s mature, without smelling old man. It smells rich and dense from most of its life on the skin. I\'d have no problem wearing this year round, but it\'s best suited for Spring, Summer, and early Fall--especially Summer. The longevity for me can be a problem occasionally. I live in Mississippi where it\'s been very hot and humid since I bought it (90 degrees F with 80% humidity typically), and most fragrances don\'t do well on skin in these conditions for me. This one has performed above average, though, getting me around 6.5 hours before it\'s just a skin scent. CC promises something like 8-10, which I think is bold of them. On clothes, it lasts much longer--unsure how long, but I could see maybe 10 hours with a decent strength. I typically spray twice on my wrist since I\'ve had a slight longevity issue in the heat, and then once behind the ear. Then the whole drive to work I\'m in heaven! I\'m unsure what the sillage is, but I imagine that before it hits skin scent time, it\'s probably around 4-6 feet or so. You can fill an elevator quickly if you\'re not careful. Compliment-wise, I\'ve not really gotten any, but I rarely do. Most people I\'m around don\'t really comment on things like that. I wear everything from Creed to Clive Christian to Armani Privé and never really get feedback. Doesn\'t really matter to me, though, because I love them enough for everyone put together! Would I buy it at $350? Only if I had to settle on one fragrance, which I think I could settle down with this one, very signature scent and one bottle collection worthy. You won\'t smell like everyone else, and the scent isn\'t so ""out there"" that everyone wonders what\'s going on. Anyhow, at $350, you could make a small collection of other really nice scents. However, if you like this one a lot like I do, it may be worth it! You have to decide. You\'ll quickly realize when you hold and spray this bottle that it\'s on a next level--a real luxury. When this one runs out, if ever for me because I rotate a lot, I\'ll probably just buy a 10 mL directly from CC, which aren\'t too terribly expensive; they\'re $75 which isn\'t a ton more than a 10 mL Tom Ford. 9.5/10 scent, 8/10 longevity, 9/10 sillage.

The supply is low and the demand is high. That means expensive, from what I heard. This site is for fragrance reviews, not bargain advice. I suppose the two can overlap, but perhaps they shouldn’t.

What a puzzlement! That doesn't mean I will rush out to get a bottle. I probably will never buy a bottle. And not because of the price. (After all, I'm willing to shell out major bucks for Creed).  What it comes down to, for me, is that even though I think 1872 is a beauty, it's not me. And I realize now it's not the fresh and natural fruits. (I love the 'fruits' in Aventus, for example). My problem (and this is just that - MY problem) are the flowers. Once the initial (short lived) fresh citrus opening dissipates, the flowers make themselves known and I'm just not a fan of flowers taking a prime spot in a fragrance.  But if you love a sophisticated, deep, light, fresh, citrus/floral fragrance - 1872 for men should go straight to the top of your list."", ""It seems that Clive Christian takes some really famous and valuable offerings and forcely blends them together.

I am not going to deny its over-complexity, but it's way too chaos and unbalanced. Maybe the quality of CC is slightly better than the average of high-end designer, say Hermes and Dior, however you cannot expect much margins. Nothing mindblowing but very pissed for the price it has been made. Rating: 4.0/10"", ""This is incredible! Wow. I can't tell individual notes too well due to the really great blending in this but I think I smell the prominent notes of lime, petitgrain, bergamot, peach, rosemary, and clary sage.

Within minutes I get a sort of soft creaminess in the background which starts to dominate as the citrus softens. Can't really pick out notes (and notes on Fragrantica seem different to those on the official Clive Christian listing?). I just get a creaminess which I can't describe, perhaps the sandalwood? It is certainly not vanilla - just a soft almost whipped feel mixed with the citrus. Either way, to describe the scent is literally as a sweet, citrus and creamy perfume.  I do like this, and so does everyone I asked to smell it however the one MAJOR issue - performance. My skin does not hold fragrances well, but this did not last - I sprayed about 4mls in one go and it was gone within 4 hours whilst sillage was probably barely 2hrs.

Sadly, when the packaging changed in recent months, the price of the 50ml bottle increased overnight by £40 in the UK and the 100ml went up by £75. Now, every time I wear it, I ask myself whether this is special enough to justify paying £350 for 100ml in future and I'm thinking not.

While it doesn\'t come across as dated at all it would feel just as ""at home"" in the 60\'s, 70\'s, and 80\'s. Very dapper, debonair, and confident. 1872 doesn\'t make you feel like a man...., it makes you feel like the man. Bergamot and citrus dominate the top. Slightly Sharp, juicy, and green with a nice bitterness that is rounded off by a beautiful lavender.  It took me a few weeks of wearing before I picked up the pineapple but now I do for sure....which makes it different and adds just the right amount of sweetness (a perfect blend with the patchouli and amber in the base) This one never goes ""too sweet"" or ""too floral"" nor does it go ""too citrus"" or ""too spicy"".

I own 1872 and it truly is like a spicy, less aquatic version of Acqua Di Dio. Fragrances are very subjective as people perceive them differently.

Because it's (almost) all natural, it has a presence and a vibe that most probably have never encountered since just about anything else out there is at least 70% synthetic or more.  It's not for everyone. The opening is bracingly dry and antiseptic - a blast of lime, pepper and pungent rosemary. This is what catches people and makes it seem so immediately old fashioned.  After that , unusual florals come out and finally woods, mosses and spices in the base. This smells a hundred miles deep - layer upon layer of notes.

Bergamot, grapefruit, lime, and mandarin can all be found dotted with spicy accents of black pepper and nutmeg, the effect of which is sparkling and rejuvenating. Bergamot and lime seem to be at center stage, noticeably more prominent and lending a regal tone to the proceedings. Things veer from the citrusy to the aromatic/herbal as petit grain, lavender, rosemary and clary sage become apparent upon drying down. It is here that clary sage\'s green, tea-like scent is bolstered by the inclusion of subtle florals including freesia, cyclamen, jasmine and tagete (marigold). The gentle and slightly sweet florals act as a perfect counterpoint, subduing the richly aromatic citrus, herbs and spices of the opening. Richly green and bitter cistus labdanum and deeply resinous olibanum are accompanied by amber, patchouli, cedar wood and musk, creating a masculine base for the composition to conclude on. Clive Christian\'s utilization of only the best natural ingredients in perfumery is readily apparent when experiencing \'1872\' for Men. The fragrance is highly dynamic and engaging, with the blending of its ingredients superb. One can notice the time and careful attention the perfumer took when composing its architecture, as each note is elegantly balanced by others so as none stand out as cloying or brash. It certainly fits well within the parameters of a classic masculine chypre, having a citrus-laden opening, a middle centered around cistus labdanum, and a musky base. This provides an interesting contrast between the fresh citrus of the top and the woody-musky base. \'1872\' for Men\'s herbaceous and green characteristics fit well during warmer weather. It is notably invigorating to apply when one is battling remaining fresh despite the stifling humidity and heat of summer. As an ""extrait de parfum"" grade formulation, longevity, sillage and projection are all excellent. In summary, \'1872\' for Men is a classic men\'s fragrance which feels elevated by its unique and luxurious ingredients as well as by the deft hand of its creator.

This is a fragrance that preferably worn in the daytime during the spring and can be worn under little chilly evenings and nights during the summer. The only negative thing I have to write about this fragrance is that the Patchouli is too prominent for my nose, and I am unfortunately quite sensitive to this note. If Clive would get the idea to remove this note, I would gladly buy the 1.7oz bottle (I currently have the 1/3oz). I strongly recommend you to try it:)', ""After trying this out at Saks today I could not get out my head how familiar this scent was to me. For hours i thought about it until it finally hit me.

It's very fresh and zingy to start with but settles into a lovely fresh mandarin, lavender and Clary sage summer cologne smell.

The Petit Grain is a classic and the grapefruit note is FANTASTIC in this one (even better than the grapefruit in Terre D\'Hermes Hermes and Bleu De Chanel IMO of course) . I\'m not usually a fan of black pepper (preferring pink pepper), but I MUST SAY the Lavender, Jasmine and Clary sage, gives it that smoothness, slight creaminess and depth.....

This is my honest opinion.', 'Day 2 of owning a bottle of this juice and feel I need to be a little more descriptive. I can understand why some people would say that the longevity of this is quite poor for the price. I think this is due to the powerful and explosive opening which projects well and fills any room.  After 1-2 hours these fireworks do die down quite rapidly and so does the overall projection. This dramatic change could fool the mind of the user to feeling that the frag has just ""gone"". This certainly isn\'t the case.  Over the course of 8 hours, I\'ve asked independent people to give there honest opinion of the scent and its potency on my skin, all of which where very positive. Yes the projection does not hold to the initial radius of the first couple of hours but it still projects adequately after this.  I do tend to go for fresh, citrusy scents, especially through the summer and I know not to expect longevity. My favourite scent this summer has been Acqua di Parma - Arancia di Capri. I did get a 150ml bottle of this in anticipation that it wouldn\'t last on my skin but surprisingly it held very well and in my opinion is one of the nicest summer scents n the market. In the evening I\'ve been waring Creed Aventus, this never fails to attract compliments. I love these two fragrances but 1872 is certainly in a different league. The scent feels so natural. At first there is a burst of exhilarating, awakening ingredients, like colourful brazilian carnival. After dried down, it is so fresh and light, but at the same time is still so sophisticated, with a beautifully synergy of fresh citrus, green & floral and a clean, almost powdery finish.  Is it worth £170 for 50ml? Maybe not, but this juice is absolutely stunning and for a fresh, lighter frag the longevity can not be shunned in my.

Good stuff if you like spicy herbs!', 'Review: 1872 For Men – The Gentleman’s Time Machine (with a Gold-Plated Ticket) Opening Thoughts: Spray this once, and bam!—you’re no longer in your living room. You’ve just stepped into a Savile Row tailor shop in the late 1800s. Someone offers you Earl Grey. There’s a grandfather clock ticking in the background. You’re not wearing cologne… you’re wearing lineage. The top notes come in crisp and green, with a citrus burst so sharp and clean it feels like you shaved your face with a lemon made of diamonds. We’re talking bergamot, lime, petitgrain—the works. It’s fresh, it’s uplifting, and it absolutely does not belong anywhere near a tracksuit. As it dries down, 1872 reveals layers like a Victorian novel. The heart turns herbal and spicy, with a bit of clove, pepper, and a whisper of neroli and rosemary, all wrapped up in an elegant vetiver base. There’s also a nice touch of cedar and moss—just enough to say, “Yes, I do own a globe bar.” This isn’t for the club. It’s for the boardroom, a jazz lounge, or a mysterious rendezvous involving silk gloves and confidential documents. It’s the smell of a man who irons his pocket squares and knows how to sabre a champagne bottle. Now, let’s talk performance—because at this price point, it better behave. Longevity? Solid 8 to 10 hours. This gentleman doesn’t pop in—he stays for dinner, dessert, and a cigar on the veranda. Projection? Classy but noticeable.

This is not a very strong fragrance. This is way more of an aromatic fragrance rather than an woody amber spicy like it shows. I require 5 or 6 sprays and it doesn\'t really last very long.

As you were.', 'This is the most masculine scent I own. Oscar De La Renta Pour Lui is close, but is obviously rougher and much, much less quality. Definitely an old school DNA. Very little sweetness, spicy and dry. I don’t find it suitable for anything except formal occasions, unless your style is very mature. It smells like an 80’s masculine scent, somewhat dated with a little something that makes it unique. That being said I’m glad I have it. I can see myself wearing it to a serious situation. Projection is ok and longevity isn’t great for the price. The ingredient/blend quality is top notch, smooth and classy. I feel it’s too dry for a flirty date scent, and too spicy for casual wear. Possibly a date to an upscale restaurant or concert. I don’t see it being a compliment grabber. If you are under 35-40 it might be too “mature”. Better suited for 40+ and professional imo. Spring and cooler weather it would work well. Probably not dead winter or blazing heat. Day to night, leaning night. Cooler days or a warm evening. Not a huge fan of the opening, but the dry down is excellent. If you’re a fan of old school powerhouses or are like me and have a collection of sweeter/fresher scents and want a black tie juice it might be worth a look. It’s not my preferred scent profile, but having a high quality juice that’s no nonsense and old school classy is no longer on my list of wants.', ""It's not a bad fragrance but it never deserves its price.

The scent of the proletariat with a price point accessible only to the bourgeoisie. Pleasant fragrance though.', 'Today we\'re heading over to one of the most prestigious and expensive fragrance houses on the planet, Clive Christian; known for making the world\'s most expensive perfume. Not this exact fragrance, mind you. I\'m sure it goes without saying, but I have zero experience with Clive Christian fragrances. They aren\'t exactly the type of fragrance you can walk up to the Macy\'s counter and spray a tester of, so I really have no idea what to expect. I\'m hoping, based on the price point, I\'m in for something really special. Let\'s get into it; Scent: The opening is woody, fruity, and spicy. The primary notes I get are Virginia cedar, rhubarb, bergamot, and cinnamon. The strongest of the notes are the Virginia cedar and cinnamon. The Virginia cedar instantly hits my nose off the first spray with a big dose of dry, piney woodiness. It\'s not a processed, lumber-y type of woodiness like some wood notes can be, it\'s much more natural like a fresh-cut cedar tree out in the wilderness. Up next is the cinnamon with its distinct warm spiciness. It\'s not nearly as strong as the cedar, but it\'s definitely there and tickles the nose. This is followed by the rhubarb and bergamot. The rhubarb is an unusual combination of sweet, sour, and green. This is my first time encountering this note in a fragrance, and while I wouldn\'t consider it something groundbreaking it does offer a bit of character to the opening. Lastly, the bergamot lends citric and aromatic tinges in the background. The dry down is woody, ambery, and spicy. The primary notes I get are Virginia cedar, amber, cinnamon, and oak moss. The strongest of the notes are still the Virginia cedar and cinnamon. Both notes carry the same accords from the opening, just smoother and more rounded out. This is followed by the amber and oak moss. The amber has risen to the top to provide its familiar deep and resinous sweetness. Lastly, the oak moss wafts in and out of the background as an inky, slightly earthy note. The iris is also noticeable in the dry down as a soft and powdery note, but it\'s subtle. Performance: Initial projection in the first hour is strong at around 6 feet. Sillage in the first hour is strong as well with an easily noticeable scent trail. After a few hours the projection had died down to about 3-4 feet, but the scent trail was still easily noticeable. The fragrance last until about the 7 hour mark where it became a skin scent. When to wear: I feel like X for Men would be a suitable wear for any season or occasion. It\'s mostly woods, which work well any time. But it has the fruit, greenery, and aromatics to work well in spring/summer, and has the spice and amber to work well in fall/winter. As for occasions, it\'s largely the same. I can see this being worn casually or formally. Anything from a get-together with friends to a wedding, this will feel appropriate. It\'s even a safe pick for the office thanks to its safe and unobtrusive nature. Blind buy: In regards to scent profile, X for Men is a pretty safe blind buy. However, that sticker shock is real; and if you\'re looking for something mind-blowing for the price you may be disappointed. Final verdict: Let\'s go through the experience here. The scent profile of X for Men is fine; woody, spicy, a little sweet, it\'s something easily digestible that anyone can enjoy. The performance is good too, good projection and sillage for the first few hours and lasting for about 7 before becoming a skin scent. Versatility is great as it can be worn pretty much anytime and for any occasion. As stated previously, this is a scent profile anyone can enjoy so mass-appeal is high. All those things combined make for a solid fragrance. However, $580 for a full bottle of this is just absurd. There\'s nothing groundbreaking here, nothing that\'s going to make you say ""Wow, that\'s incredible!"". It\'s a fine fragrance, and if it were any other house it would be priced accordingly. But because it\'s Clive Christian, it\'s pretentiously priced. In the immortal words of Peter Griffin describing The Godfather, ""It insists upon itself"". This is a fragrance for incredibly wealthy people that want to be able to say ""Oh I\'m wearing Clive Christian, a $600 fragrance."" while looking down their nose at you. I mean for God\'s sake one of their fragrance bottles literally has ""The world\'s most expensive perfume"" emblazoned on the front of it. If that doesn\'t give you an idea of what they\'re about, I don\'t know what will. Needless to say, I won\'t be buying a full bottle of this. It was fun to sample and be able to say I\'ve worn Clive Christian, but that\'s where it stops.

As with all CC price is atrocious but I've seen 50ml testers for $120 which is fairly reasonable."", ""Classic Hardcore fougere , Just a cardamom bomb heavily blended with Iris .. no way it doesn't contain cardamom . Highly recommended for Barbershop scent fans . Very strong performance"", 'I’m soooo suprised of this fragrance! Tought it would be very spicy and almost to masculine leaning. However i felt a warmth inside.  If you live in scandinavia, you’ll recongnize the smell. During winter/christmas we drink something called ”glögg”. Clive X smells exaclty like ”glögg” to my nose. Hence the warmth i’m getting! I adore this fragrance, but nothing i’d like to smell like 💐', 'Nothing to rave and nothing to rant about. Basic. boring. Nice smell. Way overpriced.', 'X Masculine is an iconic and undeniably fantastic scent profile in the world of niche men’s perfumery. There’s nothing else that smells quite like it, aside from the ones that have copied it. It sort of smells like fougere meets oriental, but mainly comes through as a warm spicy oriental scent. An enveloping warmth of smooth cardamom and spicy cinnamon takes centre stage, given a sort of fresh spiciness by ginger and bergamot. All of this rests on a rich, woody base of woods, florals and Vetiver. The journey of this scent is a battling dichotomy of zingy freshness, against warming spices - and it’s phenomenal. It’s very much in the same vein as Roja’s Reckless Pour Homme, or perhaps that should be vice versa, considering this came first. However, as Roja usually manages to do so, I find his iteration of this scent profile far superior as it feels smoother and more refined. However the Clive Christian has to be respected for the ingenuity of such a scent profile.', 'Great male Gentleman fragrance , but in my opinion , best alternative is Rosa Salas, imperial.', 'I liked it. surprised to see no Cardamom listed in the notes. I check CC website & found it was the main note at the top. Refined & very well blended as you would expect. Summer day use fragrance & do not understand why people classify it as a winter scent. Performance is average I would say. Longevity 6/7 hours with personal space projection. Feels like a skin scent for most part specially after one hour. As for any luxury item, if you have the money & like to have it then it will be a nice addition to any collection.', 'Nose Note #46 Been wearing it for two days. First I smelled it without looking at the notes and I thought: ""interestingly bitter orange with sprinkles of sugar that reappear occasionally"". But I was surprised that there is no orange. Besides that I had the vaguest impression of it. One more thing is that in the base it feels as generic as it can get - woods+amber and some sweetness. The performance is greatly disappointing. The price is ever more so. The smell is great, but it\'s nothing impressive, nothing memorable...', 'This is a fougere. I have fougere royale and I like it. I used to own Dior Eau Sauvage and hated it. Eau Sauvage is not Dior Sauvage. Hated that too, though. Sauvage Elixir is the only good one IMO. CC X for Men - Heavy cedar and Vetiver, slight bergamot, almost no pineapple, am getting the rhubarb and paprika. It kinda makes my nose want to close up. Not getting much cinnamon or vanilla. It is green and earthy and the jasmine iris are adding pleasant florals, but this is not an iris powdery fragrance - probably just for some lift, which it fails at miserably.  Is this a ""baller fragrance?"" I would say no. Is it good? It\'s alright. It definitely doesn\'t smell of any artificial aeromachemicals. It smells clean and fresh, believe it or not. It\'s like a mix of a Prada clean soapy mixed with a green Vetiver intense and some very slight peppery spices. The notes listed here do not reflect the smell, in my experience. This is more of a summer, daytime scent. It is well blended, but bsolutely do not spend the amount the site is asking for. Be careful of the fakes on eBay and Amazon. Projection 2-3 ft Skin scent almost instantly..  Longevity 4.5 hours.  Age range 32+ To clarify, the CC website sells the 50 and 100ml, and the discovery travel set was sold for a while with 3-10ml bottle variety. I\'m not sure about the 30ml. I have a 100ml bottle. You should really test it before you drop that much money. For a frag under 60 dollars, you can pretty much look at notes and reviews and take the chance knowing the things you like, but more than that requires sampling to see if you like it. Just because something costs a lot doesn\'t necessarily mean it\'s good. This smells good, but is mediocre.', 'I don\'t know what all this nonsense about 30ml all being fake. Just look above and you\'ll see it states : ""Available in Pure Parfum of 30ml, and Eau de parfum of 50 and 100ml."" I don\'t know what the difference is between a \'pure parfum\' and an EDP.  Best described as smooth and understated. No note in particular stands out and everything just melds together in a harmonious fashion. Softly, sweet, spicy clean yet earthy. It is such a shame the projection is so quiet that it is essentially a skin scent. I don\'t need something so loud it announces my presence ahead of me or lingers well after I am gone. But I would like others who are in close proximity(1-2ft) to be able to smell it as well.  This is another fragrance relegated to a might have owned but let down by poor performance. And as others have mentioned the pricing just the final nail in the coffin leaving this for dead.', ""Performance on this is quite weak. It becomes a skin scent almost instantly. Yeah, it smells refined and composed with no harsh edges. Overall it comes across quite clean but not shower gel thanks to some 'earthy' notes. It leans somewhat mature and it kinda does smell like literal money or the canvas from some painting hanging in mansion or museum.  The performance for the price is quite criminal though. They must think they are Creed. Elegant composition wholly let down by subpar performance and exorbitant pricing."", ""Weak sauce. I got one of those fake 30ml then I guess because this has no projection. I need 5 sprays to the same area and it dies down to a skin scent in an hour. Pineapple/rhubarb kinda reminds me of cheap oud/vetivers combos with an inky type aroma. Cinnamon is the most present and there's some indistinguishable white florals in the background. I like the smooth base and it does kinda smell like old paper or maybe even fresh money because of the combo of paper and ink. But again not harsh in any manner. It just feels so subdued and barely there. But otherwise it is money, literally."", 'I prefer Eau Sauvage Parfum over this… they smell alike but X is the woody version. And Eau Sauvage Parfum is the zesty version… both on same profile a middle aged serious man wearing brands like zegna, loro piana, stefano ricci, and co.', ""@drippking there are often fake clive christian fragrances on ebay, but you just have to know what to look out for. Most of my bottles of X have been from ebay, several have been 30ml and they're all authentic. They used to make 30ml, but they are discontinued for awhile now. I know, because i've owned 24 bottles of X in various sizes through the years. It's one of my top fragrances."", 'Wow. This is fantastic. It truly smells like a man with MONEY. Millionaire money. This is a man’s scent. So soy-boys and guys who hangout at Sephora, do not proceed. You will not enjoy and just say something along the lines of “this smells like my granddad!’ - of course.. he probably is a gentleman and has many investments… X is luxurious, rich, classy. Very sophisticated and oozes class. You’d wear this in the fall and winter, cooler weather, when you want to be bold. And leave an impression. A date in a pricey steakhouse, events, Christmas market, lounge, anywhere where you’re dressing to impress. It’s a cinnamon and woody bomb, spiced up in the best way and rounded out really well by the amber; I don’t get much vanilla. Again, this is a scent for a man with hair on his chest, not a boy or a guy wearing the wrong sizing in his jeans or sport coat. It smells like everything Oajan by PdM looks up to and wants to be when it grows up. Someone who wears this will have a very rich taste, be sophisticated, could be a mob boss, has a library with leather bound books, enjoys cognac, has travelled around Europe, got lost at sea and made it back to tell the tale at the local dimly lit pub in Wales', ""Don't trust them 30ml bottles they are totally fake.

An elegant, evocative fragrance, both for special occasions and for everyday wear, in cooler temperature conditions. With a woody heart, polished with cinnamon and amber, a little floral CCX is a remarkable perfume with a signature of its own, distinct and distinguished. Some say that there are many variants of this perfume and that it is not worth the price. Which variants? Maybe Vertus Monarh, but that one is way too sharp, lacking the gentle and comforting character. The essence of sophistication, CCX expresses power, gentleness, mystery and maturity. An extraordinary fragrance for the autumn days, when the leaves start to fall and the days become shorter and cooler in favor of the nights. It is very balanced, imposing but friendly at the same time, for lovers of somewhat more classic perfumes but anchored in the present. Clive Christian X represents one of the perfumes that should not be missing from a man's wardrobe. The price makes it difficult to acquire but not impossible.  As for the people who complain about the very high price, there are dozens of brands that practice the same prices and get a lot of hype, but this one doesn't, why?  Don t spend on ten ordinary fragrances and buy one that is worth it.  After all, it is a luxury product and a brand that is not afraid that it can only be bought by a certain category of people. The same can be said about luxury cars, luxury watches that can only be bought by a certain people. Obviously, CC prices did not reflect the value either, but art is expensive. And CCX is an artistic, tasteful perfume."", ""I like wearing this when I go out or go on a date, sophisticated, masculine, sweet, spicy, sensual. isn't too loud and keep a nice scent bubble."", ""I liked this fragrance Clive Christian X For Men from the first try at Galeries Lafayette, in Berlin, in 2019.

There\'s an accord in X that reminds me of vegetables, cardboard and bitter medicine (maybe campho phenique?). Probably the rhubarb. I simply don\'t like the way it smells. I think the issue is that it\'s too dry. It needs something a touch sweet in the base to round it out. It just smells like medicine on me. Not a fan of this one, which really surprised me as I like most other Clive Christian offerings. Edit: Changed to a like. Either I\'m starting to ""get"" this one now, or my decant had travel shock.

It is very well blended, complex and unique fragrance. It could definitely be a signature fragrance for me. I don\'t see it as an ""amber"" fragrance. It smells very classic chypre. But it doesn\'t smell old fashioned. First impression: base is very nice, dark mossy woods. Cardamom and cinnamon give it an aromatic, warm spicy accord. (Basenotes does list cardomom and ginger in top notes.) The Jasmine is there adding softness, smoothing out any hard edges. The iris is more of a main player than the Jasmine. Like in Frederic Malle""s French Lover, a woody vetiver fragrance, that has a great Florentine Iris that gives it a classy posh air... The paprika gives it a green vegital quality, that\'s a refreshing note to the dry woods. The rubard makes a great accord with the cinnamon for me. The pineapple is not too noticable, which is just right.  There\'s quite a lot of notes, but it doesn\'t smell too busy, as Roja Dove\'s Apex fragrance does at times feel busy. (a similar fragrance) Here all the parts are fittly joined in their proper place and intensity, well blended. PS: I tried wearing this again in late April. The opening 5 minutes was so synthetic and harsh. Like iso E super, Ambroxan, etc .. Very spicy in a peppery way. It smooths out after a while, with some naturals coming through.

A hint of jasmine gracefully lifts the heart, resting upon a delightful base of oakmoss and vetiver. At the forefront, rare and exquisite cardamom, joined by fiery pink pepper, ginger, and bergamot, unite in an explosive symphony of top notes, invigorating the senses instantaneously. Derived from the heart of the Iris flower, a symbol of fortitude, a velvety and luxurious core emerges. Accompanied by hints of violet and cinnamon, these agile notes evoke the vibrant textures of an exotic bazaar. Grounded by the robust essences of vetiver and tree moss, delicately caressed by sweet vanilla, this fragrance harmoniously balances the warm tones of cinnamon, to create a serenely earthy base reminiscent of a dew-kissed morning.

Growing up very poor, I always loved fragrance (and watches but that is another story), however tough to own fragrances when you do not have any money, it is after all a luxury not necessity, although some may argue that. Some reviews I read of this fragrance, I cannot help but wonder if the reviewer gave that fragrance enough wear in enough situations, I can tell you with 100% certainty that fragrances smell different depending on environmental situation. Sitting at my computer testing a fragrance on my arm is ok, but use as a full wearing in trains, walking around a City creating a warmer body temp, in professional environment, and at an event or restaurant, will cause different results. Over the years, and over 300 fragrances tested, they all left something to be desired, all except Clive Christian X. I first tried it from a tester at Neiman Marcus, sprayed on my wrist and started walking, as the scent developed I thought, that is it, that is what I want to smell like. So this review is to say thank you to Geza Schoen, you are ok with me bro! I now layer a couple of sprays of Escentric Molecule 01(another Geza Schoen creation) with CCX, and the result is super long lasting, confidence boosting and just plain magnificent.', ""So you like the idea of a masculine, spicy and incense heavy fragrance, but find Amouage a bit too suffocating and stomach churning? Then try out X for men. Far better blended than anything Amouage has to offer; quite striking with the spices and smokiness, but the rhubarb and pineapple balance it out quite nicely. Coming back to this review a day later, and a day more of owning this scent. I cannot say how thrilled I am with this purchase. Despite not being listed as a note, I'm picking up a tea note that I did not initially. I don't know that I've ever owned a fragrance where I can smell so many different notes yet still perceive it as this well blended. Is it overpriced? Yes of course, it's a Clive Christian. But I got a 50ml for $117, and consider myself lucky for having done so!"", ""A scent that epitomizes both masculinity and elitism. In my quest for a masculine, elite fragrance, I discovered 'X for Men' by Clive Christian, a scent renowned for its luxury and uniqueness. The experience, however, held an unexpected twist. Upon application, the fragrance opens with a pronounced, bitter powdery note, adding a smoky nuance that was more intense than anticipated. This initial impression gives way to a fougère-like character in the later stages, aligning it more with traditional masculine scents. The standout feature of 'X for Men' is undoubtedly its longevity, enduring throughout the day with consistent sophistication. It strikes a balance, suitable for both formal and casual settings, yet sometimes leaves me feeling slightly underdressed, regardless of the occasion. This paradox is a unique statement of the fragrance itself. Catered more towards collectors or admirers of the Clive Christian brand's prestige, it comes with a hefty price tag. While its distinctive powdery aspect may not appeal to all, it holds a certain allure. On a personal note, I would give it a moderate rating based on my taste, but objectively, it merits a much higher rating, a testament to its distinct character and luxurious essence."", 'Not sure about this one 🤔 reminds me of green radox', 'Top note: cardamom  Middle note: oak moss  Heart note: iris', 'Iso e super overdosed with some green dry cedar terpiniol raw materials, combined with eugenol linalool rhubufuran gives that extended grapefruit lili of the valley freshness, ionenes ،simple، strong، elegant but way too overpriced otherwise still a v.good perfume!  8/10', 'The notes mentioned here seem to be wrong. The brand website mentions cardamom as a top note. I am definitely getting a fresh and minty cardamom up top. It reminds me of Vicks VapoRub, but not in a bad way.

It is a freshie, but appropriate for all seasons.', 'Se siente como un aroma actual de crema corporal o desodorante de cosmética masculina aunque se creó en el 2001. Cremosa, ambarada, aterciopelada, cerosa, embriagante, acanelada y con aromas de maderas añejas, sin tonos sintéticos de habatonga y con fondos muy al fondo de aroma floral carnoso. Los tonos musgosos y de piña frescos le dan un apoyo aireando la mezcla densa pero no pesada, que te embuelven suave y refinadamente. Sin estridencias ni proyección fulgurante que quiera llamar la atención, simplemente su aroma se impone al corporal casi fundiéndose en el, sin crear frondosidad desgradable sino que parece aprovecharse de algún tono de agrado. Comprendo que haya personas que dejen de sentirla porque se funde en el ambiente sin imposiciones ni estridencias dándole calidez. Su aroma se adueña de forma suave(y repetiré mucho lo de ""suave"" porque es lo que mejor define a este perfume: suave y fundente).  Personalmente parece que en sus ingredientes estuviera presente el cardamomo, pero no está declarado en su composición.  Aromatiza la ropa con clase y con un muy buen gusto peculiar, agradable y adictivo. No es un aroma a ropa limpia jabonoso actual, pero parece un suavizante misterioso y con una oscuridad cálida  de principio a fin, que produce sensaciones relajantes. (Mi aroma preferido para sentirlo suavemente en las mantas de invierno). Pero el aroma perfecto no existe y por tanto sólo le encuentro un defecto y es que hasta que seca y se asienta, en piel y ropa, se perciven notas y aromas parecidos ligeramente entre el vino y aliño de aceitunas. Este aroma va desapareciendo en el asentado de la fragancia, haciéndola cada vez más cremosa y amaderada con juguetonas notas limpias, que participan con muy buen gusto creando sensaciones de opulencia y clase. Parece una fragancia para disfrutarla sin prisas, de forma comedida, empezando por una salida muy distinta a las actuales citricas que predominan el mercado.  La salida, es oscura y densa con una explosión de todas notas al unísono que se sienten como un cuero fresco empolvado y de una expansión muy contrastada de notas contrarias que acaban por unirse en un agridulce baile brillante, como anunciando el tipo de aroma masculino y maduro que es.  Esta sensación de salida explosiva, es corta y en el secado es cuando según la superficie donde se aplique, es cuando se va descubriendo, un perfume de golosas y suntuosas maderas oscuras aromaticas, acompañadas de fundentes notas de piel cálida. La mezcla se siente cada vez más uniforme tras la primera media hora y cada vez es más dificil identificar los ingredientes que empezaron tan contrastados y que ahora transmiten un aroma en conjunto balanceado al estilo fougere, que con el transcurrir de las horas, se hace más agradable profundo que baja su intensidad puliendo asperezas, bajando en acidez y subiendo en notas ambaradas y terrosas, para descubrir su fondo de notas, rico en matices aromaticos y amaderados, con reminiscentes notas florales sedosas. X FOR MEN Es claramente un perfume muy agradable...Pero caro....incomprensiblemente caro....🤷 Que te hace pregungarte porqué existen estas mezclas de perfume tan caras. Y la solución a esta pregunta es fácil: se paga por exclusividad y un alto precio hace que esté al alcance de pocos, por tanto es exclusivo (la pescadilla que se muerde la cola🤷) Realmente existen mejores y más agradables perfumes con el precio real de coste mas el margen del 50% por menos de 30€. Todos nos dejariamos dar una bofetada si fuese la bofetada más cara de la historia y si nos la diese alguien con fama y prestigio y nos prometiesen tener clase y buen gusto, haciéndonos sentir únicos y por enima del resto. Y eso es por una bofetada.... ¿Qué darias por un perfume que huele medianamente bien?😬 Si has llegado hasta el final de mi reseña y eres de los que les sobra el dinero porque las necedidades las tienes cubiertas..... X for men de Clive Cristian es tu perfume.... 😊 o cualquier otro de Clive, porque no ha hecho un buen perfume sino que hace muchísimos.... para todos los gustos🤷', 'I suppose in 2001, when this scent was released, it was a dark and mysterious, ""silent guy type"" kind of a fragrance. But it\'s 2023, and while it\'s well blended it just smells like a fragrance complimentary for older guys - I\'d say over 40. Wooden and amber notes really dominate here and - at least on my skin - there was no pineapple and barely any hint of cinnamon. Any of the Amouage ""holy trinity"", while not similar in notes, will evoke the idea behind this scent better than X For Men does. So unless you\'re going for most well blended bland and basic perfume it\'s not worth it - can\'t imagine spending so much to use it as daily office wear. It\'s not bad. It\'s just old.', ""Clive Christian X is a full on dark, woody, spice fragrance. The main note in this fragrance is Cassia. Cassia is a Cinnamon. Cinnamon is made from the inner bark. Cassia is the outer Bark. So it smells dark, mysterious, dry, intensely woody, & insanely spicy with Peppery nuances. If Cinnamon conjures images of Holiday Cooking. Cassia conjures images of Old World Autumn. The overcast day, the cool air, dry fallen leaves, damp trees & soil, pine cones, & fresh homemade potpourri.

Very masculine, very rich, complex, and so bottle worthy. I own two bottles of this. Lot of good things about this fragrance.  Clive has been underrated so much by the community; they get looked upon by some in fragcom with disdain, I believe most of it comes from judging them on regard to their pricing. Which is over-the-top. But in this modern day, lot of fragrances (and products) are over-priced. That isnt the issue anymore. It's all about performance, pound per pound. I dont think some people really care about the nuance and quality of scent anymore. Performance is king for them. Projection and longevity. This fragrance has above average performance. I am speaking from one who works in the office. A middle-aged man who is in a profession where the culture and atmosphere is a little on the conservative side. I am not defining things from the lens of a 20 year old college student desperate for attention whenever he walks into a room. It is an amazing fragrance, did I already mention that? Lot of spice and the blend is perfectly done. I wouldnt change a thing about this one.  Day or nite. It is perfect whenever the occasion. Work or a dinner date or a guy's night out. Doesn't matter. But the wearer needs to be an older gentleman, already set in his ways, accomplished, and confident. And knows that attractiveness comes through character. And the constant working on character. That is what I smell in this. Packaging is decent. The bottle is a tad tacky but I like it because it is a familiar look. It is Clive Christian. The 50ml bottles look like chess pieces. You can probably use a bottle as a king in your next game. For the fragrance alone, not considering its price or value, and for what is up my alley, I give this a 9.1."", ""This is an outstanding woody mens fragrance, quality is evident and after 10mls of usage I'm already hunting down another bottle, Geza Shoen has a style and it's a whispy silky iso-e-super gliding through heavy hitting notes , no other fragrance show cases that more than X , this is probably the highest quality cedar I've ever come across and the supporting notes compliment it well, there is pure luxury here in abundance and the wearer will feel special and well dressed using this."", ""Likeable fragrance with some interesting spicy woody nuances, but not a special one or distinctive enough.

This year I got a 5ml sample that was simply labeled “X for men”. Is there difference? Asking ‘cus it seemed so to me between the 2 I tried, the first seeming better and less spicy/peppery. I’ve also seen 2 different bottle labels one w the crown and the other with the lion and 1872. Is this just releasing it w a new label, reformulated etc? So for my this one’s a little confusing. I reached out to Clive Christian and their customer service was horrible. Didn’t answer any of my questions, gave me round around answers, were more concerned when I bought my other bottles from and then didn’t even respond. Any info is appreciated.', 'An update on my previous review is that this particular perfume still floors me with it’s utter beauty. After sampling most of the Niche House’s this is still my number 1.

This fragrance is not only sophisticated and complex but also exudes a sense of class that would make it an excellent choice for bankers, CEOs, or anyone who desires to leave a lasting impression. X for men has a spicy yet elegant scent that is both contemporary and unique. Its luxurious aroma is well-suited for the boardroom, conveying confidence and power to those who wear it. I particularly appreciate how this fragrance manages to be both bold and refined at the same time. Some reviewers may recommend cheaper alternatives, but in my opinion, the quality of X for men is worth the investment. Its carefully crafted blend of notes creates a fantastic fragrance that is perfect for those who demand excellence in every aspect of their lives. In conclusion, X for men is a great choice for anyone who wants to project an image of class and sophistication, particularly in professional settings such as the office or boardroom. Its bold, refined aroma will leave a lasting impression on all who encounter it.', ""I will agree with BerchRabbit on the Swedoft recommendation, but I will add another. Swedoft Rasputin is a more modern take on this. If you like this DNA but you find it to be a bit tired, harsh, dated, etc., go far Rasputin as it's very very close, but slightly smoother and more accessible for modern noses. If you want the absolute closest smelling fragrance to X then go for Monarch by Vertus. A little more expensive than Rasputin (but still way cheaper than X), and it smells about as close to X as possible. I've had all 3 and I would say either Rasputin or Monarch are a better alternative than X based on price, performance, and smell. It just doesn't make sense to go for the Clive Christian unless you want to tell people how you spent half a grand on a fragrance 👍"", 'Save your hard earned money and buy Rasputin by SweDoft instead.

But the scent profile listed above and people’s description make this sound super woodsy/warm spicy and winter-ish in its vibe. It EVENTUALLY gets to that to some extent, but the majority of the scent on my skin is this very sour rhubarb/citrus, fresh spicy scent. It takes at least an hour before any cinnamon becomes noticeable and the woods come in the mid to late drydown. I bought this brand new off of fragrancenet.com so it’s not a knockoff. Maybe the newer bottles have been reformulated? Just seems like a wildly different scent experience than others are describing.

I'm not saying that I don't have others in my collection that deserve this title because there definitely are, but considering the year this was released and the fact that it can already be considered a timeless classic, if I own a fragrance that is a masterpiece this is definitely it! From the slightly sweet, ambery and fruity zing in the opening, to the heavily spiced cedar of the mid to the powdery, iris forward amber and woods in the base, every stage of this fragrance is executed with perfect precision.

I feel luxurious, sophisticated, mysterious and elegant with superb dark vibes while wearing it. Freaking superb scent!', ""I don't know how I feel about this one. It's a smorgasbord of scent, yet it leaves me enjoying whiffs of this for hours on end. This scent remains largely linear for me, which is okay I guess, because the blending is beautifully done. This fragrance makes it hard to render a full account of, as I find it smells opulent yet linear at the same time, so I'm left pondering what exactly it is, even though I enjoy the composition. For me this is a spicy/woody fougere combo that gives off a certain fizzyness - yes, fizzyness (reminds me sort of like a cherry coca-cola) - in the opening that fades back into a spicy/woody mix once again. I enjoy this during the day, although the evening would be a suitable choice too. Dressed up or down I could see it being both, but I just use it for casual colder weather days. Fall/Winter use, as the heat would crank up the heavy aspects of this fragrance making it too cloying. The only downside I have with this is that it is overpriced - I enjoy the fragrance journey as it progresses and evolves telling the story it has to tell, but this remains largely the same. I don't think I would buy a full bottle at the retail prices suggested (500+CAD/48ml taxes incl.), but if it could be found for half that, I would purchase it."", ""X for Men smells for me like a spicy chypre.

This is my favourite part being quite honest. Then it slowly starts drying down to light floral chypre with a fruity twist mixed within. The late drydown (base notes) is still very chypre and woody. The composition itself reminds me of Frapin L'Humaniste because of those juniper berries. It lasts on me a decent amount of time - more than 9 hours and projection is light to moderate - just I like it to be. Being honest, it's the only Clive Christian that fits my taste.

Not for the young crowd & a compliment getter hands down. Lastly, on the smell you get, you get as others have mentioned, spice, wood, rhubarb ( the darkest of them ) with a touch of florals.

Sure it is spice dominant, but not at the expense of the other elements. It is fairly versatile, but more suited for colder weather, although you may notice some differences in the heat that keep it even more interesting.

Oak, cedar, moss, rhubarb, and cinnamon stalks are the main players. I get cloves also as there's something austere, medicinal, and smoky which is an effect cloves can create when accompanied by moss and woods. The composition is superbly blended. Schoen’s craftsmanship is without a question, evident in X. Here he brings contradicting notes such as rhubarb, woods, and spices and makes them play in harmony with such delicacy and sophistication. It’s a fantastic spicy, chypre, with an elegant oak note CC is known for. Monarch by Vertus is similar, but that one gravitates towards labdanum and cypress, and becomes closer to Italian Cypress.

The opening of X MASCULINE showcases cardamom in all its glory bright, fresh and cool.

As the fragrance shifts into the dry down orris, vetiver and vanilla add roundness to the fragrance supporting the spices which feature so heavily in the fragrances initial stages.  There is no doubt in my mind that the finest quality raw materials have been used in X MASCULINE and this is evident as to me, as this screams luxury and for that, I give this a perfect 10/10 🌟  At 20% perfume concentration the performance on X MASCULINE is outstanding.

It’s a lovely smell and quite unusual but I’m not sure if I would say this was a go to. I’ll edit this once I’ve been out on the town with this on.', 'Breathtaking, signature-scent worthy creation from Geza and CC. Unlike anything you have tried until now. At first I was not convinced, the price had me skeptical so I bought a small decant from a Facebook group, wore through it, I was intrigued. I then purchased a 30ml bottle shortly after and it started growing on me. Finished that in 2 months and bought a 100ml immediately after, upon realising there is quite nothing like this, it is a masterpiece.  In a couple of words: cinnamon, airy hot&cold spices, woods, some slight sweetness from amber finishing with smokiness in the base from the vetiver. However, this doesn’t do the scent justice. There are lots of small nuances from the other notes which you pick out the more you wear it. It is simple and mass-appealing enough to be appreciated by anyone at all occasions, yet all it’s extra notes and expert blending add an additional level of complexity, making an unequivocal statement and leaving a distinct impression.  Lasts forever and smells expensive. Moderate silage, it won’t fill a room but it will get you noticed by people around you. A little story: I have a travel atomiser of this and I sprayed it in my friend’s bathroom before a dinnerparty at his parents place this christmas, he said the scent lingered on the walls and basin for almost a week and was quite mesmerised by it. He bought a decant from me shortly after. His parents, despite not knowing the brand, both people of significant financial means and status who I look up to, also complimented me on it when I wore X to their party. This is a testament to the quality and impression X leaves. The price is high, on par and higher than many niche houses. I have many regrets, buying scents from Roja, Creed, Fragrance du Bois, etc. but this one I do not regret for a second.

Not too old school tho"", 'Ok, I’ve been living with CcX now for 3 days and wanted spend some time with it before coming to any conclusions or viewpoint. I had done a fair amount of reading on this prior (as I do with all Frags) and found a (relatively) reasonably priced bottle (30ml Wrapped Box for £85 inc postage from the Bay) and received the next day. On Very first blast my initial impression was a multi faceted floral note quickly followed by the Cinnamon which I found to be dry and bark like with a subtle sweetness (cinnamon and sugar with butter on toast) that is quite realistic. I immediately thought of Comme des Garçons Early Parfum but no way near as peppery or sweet but more a more palatable to my nose. The Cinnamon is the constant in X for me, I do not get any specific fruit notes par se but i do get a fruity vibe on top which is blended well and transitions into a Spiced Wood accord until it falls close to the skin towards its end. I would say longevity is pretty average (3/4hrs) but projection is fairly good as I have been catching whiffs Whilst its surrounding me. I’ll get this on any time of year for special occasions as it really is not cheap. It does have a regal disposition however and lifts your spirits as intended. I like X but is it really worth the extortionate prices and truly be justified? I guess that is really a personal issue, for me, I got it at a fair price point and that is my justification this time... I’ve got food in the fridge. We do tend to measure a lot of things in life in monetary terms and I admit am guilty for this. However, if we listened and were more truthful to ourselves maybe, more often, then we could see through the smoke screens. Truthfully, Our inner satisfaction and enjoyment is not necessarily relative to price, none of us like to be ripped off or mugged even, so we would be by far, much better off, on all levels if we did not mug ourselves. There are some fragrances out there that hit the spot for me in all aspects but not the pocket (all the Encre Noire’s/Cristiano Ronaldo PE etc) for example... if you ain’t no snob yet, these quality fragrances are 1st Class and satisfy me quite frankly, inside and out but don’t break my piggy bank.

It is almost off-putting except for the fact that I know what comes next is soo divinely good.

The drydown of vintage Tsar and the drydow of this scent are very similar."", 'I purchased this for a heavily discounted price - $149 for 30ml - so my review will take into account this price point and not the original price.  X opens with a blast of harsh citrus and heavy, dusty woods. I would consider the opening to be fairly unpleasant and stringent.  The opening on my skin lasts no longer than 3 minutes - and the fragrance noticeably switches direction. I’m pulling a faintly sweet rhubarb note, contrasted with oakmoss and woods. It is very unique - and I quite like it.  As the fragrance continues to mature, the edges become softer and the woods and amber become more pronounced.  I’m drawing a slight resemblance to a mark buxton scent - in that the rhubarb note presents similarly. I can’t recall the scent - potentially devil in disguise - but if you’ve smelled the rhubarb there, it’s a similar presentation in X. My overall thoughts on this fragrance ($149) are that it’s unique, masculine and wearable. I find this to be a confidence inducing scent and I must say, I think the high praise is warranted (though I would probably feel differently if I had paid full price). This smells like nothing in my collection, and I genuinely find it very enjoyable.  This is a love for me.', 'First off, I\'ll admit that I did something that I strongly advise people not to do - blind buy. To make it more emphatic, it\'s the most expensive blind buy I\'ve made to date and there really wasn\'t any of the traditional hype to prompt the buying. I was in a fragrance buying mood and someone I know that has similar tastes to mine had bought it and said that he liked it. That, in addition to reading multiple reviews and a bit under $130, I was able to pick up a 1 oz bottle. My most expensive blind buy turned out to be a big win for me. Clive Christian X for Men is a very classy, clean and fresh fragrance with exceptional versatility that\'s suitable for virtually any occasion, when you just want to smell good. Casual nights out, dates, weddings, funerals, the office - whatever - it\'s great. The only situation where it may not be good is for someone from a younger crowd who\'s still into the clubbing scene and wants ""beast mode"" fragrances that scream out ""smell me"", in an effort to overwhelm those around them. In regard to individual notes at the opening, I have a difficult time discerning them but as the fragrance dries down, I can start to pick them up: cinnamon, a bit of woods and citrus - of which I\'d expect to smell more of the citrus in the top notes.  I\'m assuming the fresh scent of the fragrance is mostly provided by the florals and the cinnamon isn\'t your typical deep or grainy off of the kitchen shelf cinnamon. The cinnamon is much more subdued and blended in a way to where I\'d picture it as a very fine powder that \'s expertly blended. In other words, you\'re not going to smell like you\'ve been rolling in heavy cinnamon.  From what I\'ve seen and written myself, it seems that people write much more glowing and emphatic reviews when they first get a fragrance but the enthusiasm wanes in retrospect. In this case, I truly believe that this is one that I\'ll always have on my shelf. It\'s instantly become the best ""dumb reach"" fragrance that I have and without question, it\'s absolutely perfect for the office,  Projection and longevity are average - about 6 hours or so - but about what I\'d expect from a fragrance of this caliber.  In the end, I liked it so much that I went back and bought the 3.4 oz size. The 1oz size bottle is small and compact enough to make it perfect for traveling.  Normally, I don\'t give numerical x of 10 ratings but I\'m going to do it in this case.

The quality is absolutely incredible. It's like this is super dark and heavy BUT being so light and airy at the same time. It is so weird but it all comes together to make one extremely unique scent.  I've never experienced something so opposite in the same bottle.  The dark and heavy side makes me feel like this is too mature for me (I am 28), but the light and airy side makes my mouth water. Cedar, cinnamon, amber, bergamot, styrax, vetiver, iris.... 10/10 for a superb fragrance way before its time!"", ""It took me a few wears before I even could say what it smells of. It is complex, and various parts come out at different times. The cinnamon-rhubarb thing is what I'd say is the main feature now, and I like it. But sometimes I get just the rhubarb by itself, very clearly, which is gorgeous. At other times it smells soapy, or I get a stale fruity drydown which I associate with a part of Amouage Jubilation that I don't like so much. But, as I said, it changes every time, so it is quite likely that my feeling about it will evolve."", ""This smell is no good for someone young.

But a little research a phone calls, £160 for 90ml from Clive Christian them self’s.  Absolutely love this fragrance, I love catching the smell every now and then. This stuff last a solid day on cloths and 7-8 hours on skin. I feel like it’s a little close to Dior intense, but this is more on the complex side. I wish it was more affordable hence I would make it a daily use, signature fragrance', ""QUESTION: How similar is this to Roja Reckless? I'm in love with that one but not with the price, though Alexandria got a clone of X for Men, so I'm thinking about blindbuying if they're similar. Thank you :)"", 'Nice floral, long lasting scent. 8/10', '10/10', ""An authorized CC store decided to quit carrying the brand, and they cut prices in half. Combining with some coupon codes and rewards points, I purchased 4 from the brand (1872, No. 1, Rock Rose, and X) for much more relatively reasonable prices because I doubted I'd ever get an opportunity to get shady eBay-like deals from a real boutique--no worry of authenticity or spoilage. Got this 50 mL for $132.25, normally $350. I feel like that's worth mentioning. I almost didn't buy it because I liked it least of the other 3, but I figured I'm paying Sephora/Ulta prices for one the most niche and high-end brands out there. Glad I got it; it's unique and standout.  The bottle on this one isn't quite a special looking as the others, but that cap, like the rest of the, is really nice! The sprayer is also on-par with Creed, if not nicer. It's got a lot of control. This is the undoubtedly the most masculine scent that I own. It's also probably the longest lasting and probably highest sillage, too. It's like a cloud of man. Not for the faint of heart. You can't be dainty and easily pull this off. It's likable, and I think fairly versatile for most occasions in small doses. The smell is very woody with an undertone of spice that carries throughout the scent. It's maybe a little oriental. It gets better as the day goes on, becoming smoother and more likable as it develops. It got on one of my watch straps, and it lasted on there kinda as a skin scent for over a week--smelled like one of the best scents I've ever smelled in my life! It's wood, without being oud, which is really good because most people I'm around HATE oud! Would probably do best in the Fall and Winter, but I've worn this a few times this Summer, which is when I purchased it. This is the most potent fragrances I've ever owned, and it just needs a very small amount. My 1.7 oz bottle will last forever. If I ever run out, I'll buy a 10 mL directly from Clive Christian for $75--which is well worth it because you have to be so sparing in using this so you'll go through that over the course of what you'd probably do for a bottle of much larger size for that price. Would I buy it again? Definitely, especially at the steal that I got it. At $350? Honestly, maybe. It's quite unique and would last forever. 10 mL is probably the way to go, though--at least for me. 9/10 scent, 12/10 longevity--lasts forever, 10/10 sillage."", 'Absolutely NO scented water is worth the amount of money these clowns rip the naive public off for!

Having sampled this on skin a couple times, I can say objectively this is a very nice, spicy-woods scent. Labdanum, styrax, and cinnamon blend to make a comfortable warmth in the fragrance which is accented by the sweet woodiness of Virginian Cedar. Of course, this has been done before in similar fashion, spicy woods are nothing new. However, looking at X Masculine it is a very nicely composed scent. This is obviously of a higher quality than something like Ferrari Silver Essence (a VERY quality fragrance for those of you who like smoky spice and woods); it is complex and has dimension and depth. The spice and woods are complimented by a mild tart fruitiness, powdery notes, and a touch of oakmoss.  A quality fragrance, regardless of price.', ""@C-Sauce Glad to hear that.

If we consider him as the main director of this house which many perfumers worked under his supervision, atleast they should have named him as one of the perfumers of this fragrance. This raised some questions around how fragrance encyclopedias get informations about perfumer(s) of certain fragrances.another reason is found when you try his other perfumes on other houses and you would find his signature in CCX.He is a master perfumer in working with oud and oriental and spicy materials. Same issue is visible on Creeds line in fragrantica.they don't name perfumers of many creed's fragrances like Green Irish Tweed,Silver Mountain Water,Virgin Island Water,Aventus,...

You can imagine the texture of the coarse fibres as you crunch into a stalk and shiver from the sour tang. This is rhubarb in high-fidelity gigapixels.

If it’s edgy, angular or trendy you want, look elsewhere. But if you want your scent to ooze class, you can’t go wrong here. (Just hide the tacky bottle from guests.)

It feels luxurious and confident, no-nonsense, yet approachable and ultimately uplifting. I find there are no notes which are particularly dominant or exposed in X but rather it's a unified blend which is made up of all of these elements equally contributing to its whole. It has a timeless quality which smells both traditional and perfectly at ease in a contemporary setting, though perhaps best suited for the over-30 crowd. Projection is both solid and reserved, which is perfect for this kind of scent. It's not supposed to be loud or attention-seeking, yet it's certainly there, and will be noticed by those nearby.

This ia a rich potent juice that exudes refined masculinity and develops beautifully on your skin. It is a cuddly scent that has moderate to strong projection, sillage and longevity.

A fragrance at this price shouldn't share such a prominent note with cheaper fragrances. Secondly, although this lasts a long time, it does not project.

Many have been likening it to 1 of my Niche favorites; Reckless, by Roja but I cannot be inclined to agree. Reckless is simply better with its blend and more refined and smooth. It is also more syrupry-sweet rather than the powdery-sweet of X. Plus points are X is a little sweeter but unlike Aventus for Her, there's no violet to add a 'blue hue' to the sweetness of the pineapple; it's like a thick natural syrup of it here and powdered up a bit later on by the iris. They're sort of the same appeal-wise to me; not too much at all, sort of average but nothing I'd come close to buying!! There are also some spices to add the slightest hint of cooking-green and exotic nature. The Amber is very good here in the drydown, subtly sweet yet gentle but present and assuring. The Quality is not going to trouble the Creeds or Roja too much but it's up there, close. I struggle to find pimento but maybe some oakmoss might become a little intrusive on few and far between wearings in the coldest weather but it's not really an issue.

Jasmine, pineapple, cinnamon, ginger and cardamom combine with orris, vanilla and cedar wood to create a lightly smoky, mossy, addicting effect. The cinnamon is very dry and natural, not candy-ish or cloying, and is a core component of this fragrance. If you don't like cinnamon, you may want to look elsewhere.  It smells nearly identical to Roja Dove Reckless. It sits close to the skin after the first couple of hours and is more of an intimate scent. It is not heavy or dark, and I find it suitable for both warmer as well as cooler climes, and incredibly safe and elegant.  But is it worth $220 an ounce? That's a tough call with so many good choices for less money. I've seen others compare it to Costume National Homme, which costs a fraction of X ... But then again, Roja Dove's Reckless extrait retails for $480.  At the end of the day, I think it is superb and wanted it in my collection.

Biting cardamom, piquant pimento, terpenic juniper berry and spicy ginger are most notable. The quartet harmonize well and tickle ones nose with their vibrancy, while lending an overall exotic and Far East atmosphere. A floral heart emerges amidst this lively opening, featuring indolic jasmine sambac. Its scent is more musky, spicy and mysterious in tone when compared with the more traditionally used jasmine grandiflorum. Here it renders an alluring and sensual quality to the composition. Orris root adds yet another layer to the sultry heart by creating a caressing smoothness with its silky, sweet scent. As the fragrance dries down, a robust woody accord rests in its base. Most notably cedar's woody, linear scent is decorated with warm piercings of cinnamon. The cinnamon so elegantly utilized by the perfumer smells authentic and rustic, less harsh and synthetic. Vetiver and oak moss lend a smokey muskiness while amber and vanilla create an oriental flair. The amber-vanilla fusion in the dry down is subtle, avoiding becoming too powdery, too gourmand, or too resinous.  'X' for Men by Clive Christian is an enigmatic fragrance, one which is deeply masculine and debonair. A myriad of aphrodisiac scents are included within the composition. Vanilla, amber, cinnamon, citrus, jasmine, cedarwood, vetiver and ginger are all considered natural erotic scents and are all featured within the fragrance. Sillage and longevity for 'X' for Men are superb, being still perceptible on skin and clothing even after twenty-four hours post application. Due to the depth and sophistication implied by the scent, I prefer to reserve wearing it for evenings and nights out on the town.

I don\'t detect pineapple at all and it\'s an orris root note, not iris, at the core of this fragrance. Below is the breakdown from a site where I purchased a bottle that appears more accurate since it includes cardamom and orris, both conspicuously missing from the Fragrantica pyramid: Top notes: bergamot, spices, cardamom, ginger, juniper berry Heart notes: sambac oil, jasmine hedione, pimento oil, orris Base notes: amber, vetiver oil, cedarwood, oakmoss, cinnamon, vanilla ********************** I have fallen for this fragrance which seems to grow more regal with each wear. Pardon the touch of melodrama, but I couldn\'t in all honesty state it in a crasser manner... it just has a bearing that is, well, royal. On first impression, I thought it was a beautiful floral spicy perfume that evoked a pleasantly warm and vibrant feeling, but couldn\'t say for certain that it lived up to my grand expectations. That doubt went away in time as it developed into a lush, luxurious symphony of spiced orris and vanillic woods tamed with a flourish of floral sensibility, and has currently mesmerized, enchanted and awed me into declaring it my favourite fragrance. On my skin, it lasts longer than any other in my collection and has excellent projection and sillage for this type of scent. It isn\'t as weapons-grade as some others I own, but that plays in its favour, as it is of a more subtle, elegant character that perhaps truly deserves the regal insignia on its packaging: it doesn\'t wage war on the olfactory senses, but instead romances them with gentle force. That said, I realize that Clive Christian gets some deserved criticism for its boisterous marketing that some may feel borders on gauche, but thankfully the bottle for \'X\' doesn\'t have the lofty ""most expensive"" moniker stamped on it as \'No.1\' does. As for the pricing, yes it\'s bloody expensive, it\'s a luxury item afterall, but given that it\'s an extrait concentration (25% vol.), when comparing it to other niche quality extraits on the market (Guerlain Habit Rouge L\'Extrait costs about 300 Euros for 50ml, Puredistance M retails for $590 for 100ml), it doesn\'t seem as significantly overvalued. I can attest to its superb quality; it\'s the only perfume in my collection that doesn\'t cause burning irritation when sprayed on my sensitive skin right after shaving, a testament to the lower alcohol content and high quality natural ingredients. All in all, I am thoroughly delighted by it, and with 2-3 sprays per use, the bottle should last me a good long while. A wonderful fragrance, can be worn year round but most appropriately for formal occasions. It gets my highest recommendation if price isn\'t an issue. A masterpiece in the realm of modern perfumery.

Unlike anything you have tried until now. At first I was not convinced, the price had me skeptical so I bought a small decant from a Facebook group, wore through it, I was intrigued. I then purchased a 30ml bottle shortly after and it started growing on me. Finished that in 2 months and bought a 100ml immediately after, upon realising there is quite nothing like this, it is a masterpiece.  In a couple of words: cinnamon, airy hot&cold spices, woods, some slight sweetness from amber finishing with smokiness in the base from the vetiver. However, this doesn’t do the scent justice. There are lots of small nuances from the other notes which you pick out the more you wear it. It is simple and mass-appealing enough to be appreciated by anyone at all occasions, yet all it’s extra notes and expert blending add an additional level of complexity, making an unequivocal statement and leaving a distinct impression.  Lasts forever and smells expensive. Moderate silage, it won’t fill a room but it will get you noticed by people around you. A little story: I have a travel atomiser of this and I sprayed it in my friend’s bathroom before a dinnerparty at his parents place this christmas, he said the scent lingered on the walls and basin for almost a week and was quite mesmerised by it. He bought a decant from me shortly after. His parents, despite not knowing the brand, both people of significant financial means and status who I look up to, also complimented me on it when I wore X to their party. This is a testament to the quality and impression X leaves. The price is high, on par and higher than many niche houses. I have many regrets, buying scents from Roja, Creed, Fragrance du Bois, etc. but this one I do not regret for a second.

This is a really solid release by Lalique. I like it! I can see the comparisons to Gucci Pour Homme II. Opens with a crisp refreshing citrus blast over a woody bed of violet and cardamom. As it settles down it dries into a slightly sweet beautiful woody amber with subtle warm spices (that's where I believe some are drawing the Spicebomb comparison). I would say it's almost like a fresh version of l'Occitane's infamous Eau des Baux. Performance is average: I got about 6 hours with 5 sprays around my chest. Projection is good for the first hour and grows more muted by hour 2, giving pleasant wafts for the following 2-3 hours and finishing as a skin scent in the last hour or so. I would say the performance is slightly better than YSL l'Homme as is projection, to give a benchmark that many are familiar with. Not beast mode performance by an means, although when it was released it performance of cheapies wasn't as relevant as it is today. I could see this working well in all 4 seasons except in the extreme heat or cool. As someone else already mentioned, this would be fantastic for layering, I could see this being used in place of something like an Escentric Molecule, pleasant smooth slightly spicy wood is what you are getting for the bulk of its duration. Something like Dior Homme Cologne 2022, Issey Miyake L'eau D'issey Pour Homme, or YSL l'Homme would go great over this and they would perform better together. My final note would be that after a little digging, this was released as both an EDT and an EDP with slightly different notes according to the variation, but they both seem to be very similar. The modern bottles have a 2-D engraving of a horse head and seem to all be in EDP concentration; as far as I can tell, the EDT is no longer in production.  Equus is very pleasant, albeit simple, but it does lack a certain je ne sais quoi. Subjectively, I'd give it a 7.75/10 even though I want to mark it as a love because I'm very biased in favor of Lalique frags."", ""Gucci Pour Homme II meets Spicebomb?!? Sign me up! Just ordered a bottle, can't wait to try it!"", ""A spicy refreshing soft woody fragrance. Composed very well and smoothly blended.

My skin soaks it fairly quickly but on clothes I can smell it all day and projects a little less than a arms length. Makes for a perfect wear for an outdoors lunch date in the warm and cool weather. I envision an older retired man on a yacht or pleasure boat in the Mediterranean enjoying ice cold vanilla mojito when I smell this even though the fragrance doesn't have mint or vanilla in it. It just reminds me of mint that's been mulled in sugar and vanilla. A great fragrance. Mid 20s and up. 8/10"", ""Bought this hoping there would a resemblance to Gucci Pour Homme II. It's been years since i owned GPHII, but this is most definetly not how i remember it. Instead, once you get past the rather fresh opening this smells alot like VR Spice Bomb (Not extreme).

Lol! And yes, the performance. I\'ve for the most part found that with many Laliques, after they\'ve ""macerated"" for a couple months have a vast improvement with performance and even the scent itself, but the performance hasn\'t changed (too much) with Equus. Now, It has improved just a bit, and my opinion has changed bc I\'ve realized that maybe a soft, ""Gentlemanly"" scent certainly has it\'s uses and I suppose it\'s good to have some fragrances with more dialed back performance. I really do like the citrus/Juniper berry opening and dry/woody dry-down and find it quite classy/elegant.  Imo classy-gentlemanly-elegant scents shouldn\'t scream off your skin, plus it is nice to have some fragrances that behave the way Equus does. I do get about 3 to 4 hours on skin before it becomes a pretty faint skin-scent, and it does last a bit longer on clothes of-Course. Equus is great to wear for office, maybe church, interviews and meetings for instance bc it can be considered a professional smelling dna that wont offend others around you especially bc of it\'s intimate sillage. Equus is a very nice, scent that\'s quite versitile bc of it\'s soft/moderate performance. Now Ive read here on Fragrantica from a few folks who say that this new formulation/performance does NOT compare to the older formulations, but I guess I consider myself lucky as I don\'t know what I\'m missing. As for the current formulations, it\'s a nice 7 outta 10 scent imo.', 'This was just 20€ but it smells like money.', 'Wonderful spring/fall barn scent.

It's a like but not a love for me, as I've come to realize I'm not a huge fan of the dominant sequoia which ironically makes it unique.

Overall a great sophisticated manly scent that's great value for it's price."", ""Mostly I get juniper and other wood notes, sweet powder, and cardamom. Not super sweet, rich cardamom like in ysl la nuit, more like cardamom herbal tea. The drydown has some of the mossy patchouli wood quality of LPH lion, which gives it a welcome bit of heft and maturity. Very nice. It really doesn't smell like gucci pour homme 2, which I have owned for many years, but it is in the same family of sweet, powdery wood fragrances with green notes and spice. GPH2 has a pronounced cinnamon note and is much sweeter, with peppermint and a transparent cedar.

Renowned for their glass blowing skills, the company naturally began crafting ornate vessels for their own perfumes.  Equus is a woody unisex-masculine fragrance comparable to Chanel's Sycomore of that house's Exclusifs collection, but at a vastly more affordable price. Unfortunately the new bottle design abandons Lalique's glass making heritage and replaces it with a tacky two dimensional horse engraving. The formula has also been shamefully diluted. I am not sure why Lalique decided to diminish their brand when middle eastern competitors (plagiarist thieving clone companies) are issuing releases in increasingly elegant bottles. Some executive should probably be let go for this scandal. Critiques aside, for $20 - $30 Equus is still a steal compared to Sycomore.

I’m not saying it’s a clone, but if you think of what Mont Blanc Explorer is to Aventus, that’s kind of how Equus is to Royal Oud in my opinion. It’s fresh and woody, with warm spices.

Can't believe my bottle is already 10 years old and the juice still smells fantastic."", ""What an amazing classy, woody fragrance. A couple months ago, I saw this on FragranceNet for around 30 dollars. And I blind bought it. I was impressed by how high quality this fragrance was for the price. It starts very woody, citrusy and peppery ( Even though black pepper is not listed in the note breakdown ). It dries down to a more woody, slightly less peppery, fresh spicy fragrance.  The performance is pretty good one this fragrance. I get around 7 hours with a medium projection on my skin. I recommend this for all seasons, best during the spring and fall, but you can also wear on summer nights as well. This makes this fragrance extremely versatile for all seasons and occasion. You can wear this casually dressed down, to a graduation, dressed up, running errands, and maybe a party in the day time. You don't have to go too heavy on the sprays too, in my experience I would spray 6-8 times to make it last longer. But you can do as many sprays as you want, this is just my personal preference.  Lastly, this fragrance suits all age groups. If you're a young guy, I could see you rocking this. If you're an older individual, I could also see you rocking this too. If your asking if its a safe blind buy, then yes it is. This is a perfect gift for any age group.

Both are excellent for the price and I enjoy both. Actually and I am my second bottle on both - despite owning tens of fragrances, these two I actually ran out of. Both are just so super great for simple everyday use. Since I never found these similar that comment about similarity made me test thoroughly again. There are similarities in the woodiness in the opening but otherwise I do it find them similar at all. Equus is woody spicy and fresh and great for versatile use. it is classy and great for work, but not playful or sweet. Equus is for classy and serious moments. Str8 ahead goes quickly way more aromatic and is way less woody and is a great alternative for citrus freshies but I would not use it for work or when wearing something stylish. I like to use it for the gym mainly. I could use it with jeans and a t-shirt, but not with anything more formal. Neither one is for dates or nights out. The first bottle of Equus is actually the only perfume in my collection that has eventually gone bad. It lasted about 4-5 years but then the smell turned sour and the color of the juice changed. Luckily I only had about a fifth of the bottle left at that point.', ""It's very surprising not to see cedar in the pyramid here, but I guess it must be the sequoia. Regardless, the violet leaf gives this a very green sappy conifer feel, like fresh-cut cedar with a touch of musk in the base. I don't get much in the way of citrus or spice but I guess it's buried in there somewhere. A pleasant, if rather simple, dry coniferous scent that I enjoy very much wearing on occasion, though it can get a little harsh if overapplied."", ""Smells like STR8 Ahead to me, but it's much smoother and a bit softer which is exactly what STR8 Ahead is missing."", 'this can suit anyone any age. its surprisingly sweet like haribo', 'If you wanted to capture the essence of an evergreen forest, an old cabin with exposed beams, and fresh hay, this is it.

This is one that i will have at least 2 bottles for safety. Masculine with a barbershop smell, but a very nice and easy smell. Just amazing.', 'My favourite fragrance so far.Its suitable almost for every occasion.Everyday, office, special occasion, whatever you like except club.Due to expensive smelling it can fit into date category, also because it feels warm spicy.

I think Spicebomb is a teenage perfume 21 at most if we speak in age. But that's just me and I'll be fair and say when you smell it up close it has some resemblance with Gucci PH II which was my signature for a couple of years but it's not that close and you can smell the resemblance only when you put your nose to the place you applied the fragrance but in the air, it smells like Spicebomb but for more mature... well I can't say men but I can't say boys either. I have this picture of well dressed man who can pull this one off and won't smell like he's wearing a teenage perfume but maybe I'm wrong so I'll say this one is for 21 to 30 speaking in age.

Performance is good on me but not the strongest.  Another great Lalique quality offering worth having.', ""This is really good quality juice for a very reasonable price. Classy but not overly serious, beautifully blended. But I am amazed that no one else mentions the mint note in this. It cools the skin and sinuses for hours, though first noticeable around the 30 minutes mark. I know it isn't a listed note, but... To me, this is a cousin to Guerlain Homme and Eau Boisee, with the citrus, mint, woods and vetiver. Yes, performance isn't as good as I might wish, but hit your clothing with a bit and respray if you need to. This is excellent workmanship, at least if you are over 30 years old."", 'I smell celery seed heavily & I love it!', ""Current cartoon 🐴 formulation. I'm not familiar with any earlier version but I do know Quorum Silver and happen to come from the countryside. This is indeed akin to some more refined, less spiky, though not necessarily better version of the Quorum. In practice the two are probably interchangeable.  While I can understand why some say that this smells like hamster bedding or wood shavings, I don't really get either. To me this is quite authentically semi-fresh and green (though woody), a little like grass that has yet to dry to hay. It also has a slightly fruity spiciness that makes me think of some old-skool, natural, home-made cola or something similar. It makes me think of galangal or something else rooty, and/or some kind of aromatic (vetiver-like?) grass that someone in Indonesia or Malaysia might use to make tea. It is by no means a super-dry fragrance but anyway, yes, it does smell somewhat like a clean, well-kept stable (devoid of manure and, at the moment in question, horses) on a pleasantly mild day. It's special."", ""Lalique Pour Homme Equus is bottled elegance! I definitely can't imagine younger guys wearing this fragrance, because from his exit until his last breaths, he demands fine clothes, high-design shoes, ultra exclusive places and fine people around, drinking sparkling wine and eating canapés. In me it opens aromatic, with citrus nuances seasoned by spices and that with each movement gain a more velvety touch, the latter manages to remain in the opening, middle and base quietly. Soon, it takes on a more serious look and brings the DNA of finesse that Lalique imprints on her creations, that chypre sensation which has citrus in the middle making the process more airy, close to the skin and why not lasting?! Burning woods are perceptible here and you can't help but feel like you're about to start a millionaire betting race (I've never been in one, physically, but I imagine)! Finally, it ends up being super aromatic, with very pronounced Vetiver roots on a fine leather from a car seat and a few more floral hints, but what most catches my attention here is the sweet touch of the resins that are like a second skin, characterizing its farewell like a fine post-shower for a man who definitely knows how to take care of his beauty."", ""It seems to me like spice bomb leau version. Top citrus really quickly changes to woody skin scent. So it's may ok for summer season"", 'I have the EDP version. This starts off with a peppery, citrus opening and quickly gets woody.

When I 1st tried, I legit thought somebody was cooking a steak with bloody amount of peppers dumped No joke. This smells like the spices sold in Walmart and u bring your nose close into the bottle It starts with subtle citrus notes quickly disappears into cardamom with the support of pepper and then vetiver kicks in. That\'s it.  This is an experimental fragrances rather than a cologne. It\'s like ""What if a pepper could turn into a fragrance?"" thoughts substantiated into reality. I can hardly even think of ANYONE who would try wearing peppers all over him No for me', 'It is great :) it is really similiar to Cologne Florida Water which my barber uses.', 'Just received this one, D0D22, 2022 batch. Blind Buy that I finally decided to take a plunge on due to alot of glowing and helpful reviews (Rowan Walters and Alphairone stamps of approval always get my attention).  Word of warning, I was hoping to receive the old indented bottle, as I just like the aesthetics more - I ordered off a discounter on ebay for $30 and the old indented horse bottle was pictured, however I received the new etched style. Unless you have confirmation otherwise, you\'ll likely receive the new style. Totally fine, as I don\'t display my bottles, but the etching does seem a little cheap in comparison. Moving on.  From one spray to the wrist: opens up with fresh citruses, and a really nice, ever so slightly sour juniper (perhaps bolstered by a subdued violet note?). Quickly transitions to cedar/woods & spice, with a touch of pepperiness. The woody and cedar notes in this are definitely there from the jump, and much nicer and more present compared to others I have encountered (looking at you Quorum Silver). There is nothing sharp, synthetic, or cloying in this one, which was my main gripe with Quorum Silver. That one had a nice cedary base with spice, and I loved the overall profile, but it just had a single note in the top/heart that would just dig into my nostrils and ruin the experience. Nothing but smoothness from Equus in comparison, although performance does seem slightly more shy.  Initial vibe impressions are a great balance of outdoorsy, down to earth wisdom, and refined, tasteful elegance. Quiet, understated, and simple refinement. Not in your face, Equus knows there is an art to subtlety that wins out over those who shout. Although all the notes are traditionally masculine, I could actually see this on working any gender, and is more about personality fit and note preference.  Skews a bit more mature as far as age. If someone under 25 were wearing this you\'d suddenly find yourself referring to them as your ""colleague"" or ""fellow"", rather than ""co-worker"" or ""pal/bud/friend"". However, Equus doesn\'t take itself too seriously, and overall strikes a wonderful balance in scent profile and in tone and overall ambience. I\'m really satisfied with this one so far, and looking forward to repeat wearings and further experiencing the intricacies it has to offer.', ""It's such a beautiful, well-blended masculine scent. The potent woods and resins mixing with the mace is something that is far too rare. It's a welcome change from all the peppers you smell now. It legitimately makes me happy to smell this. I wish there was a higher quality version of this somewhere. Lalique has moved on though and there will never be a surprise parfum of this coming out. The warnings about skin chemistry are also somewhat true. In high heat this can stop being beautiful and become too cedary and astringent, even a touch uric. Unfortunately I picked my bottle up right as they transitioned to the pathetic etched cartoon picture. The collar isn't even attached on my bottle, it was just glued down. Lion also has the same cheap construction but the glass was at least original quality. This was easy to recommend when it was $25 but you really need to be a fan of these older style Laliques to seek it out."", 'Beautiful Bottle.... Beautiful Scent.... I was lucky to find the original indented horse version... This is no slouch so hold back on the sprays just a little as the vetiver is quite pronounced in the far dry down and can be a little sharp... A lovely blend of woods and juniper with vetiver taking over in the vary far dry down... The sequoia defines this... Its such a unique component and so realistic to me at least... A real quality feel to it and the bottle is the nicest I\'ve come across but somewhat let down by the cap which becomes literally ""fall off loose""... Not one to pick up by the cap... The scent stands out from the crowd however and should most certainly be picked up were possible...Just not by the cap... A+', ""A spicy mellow hug of rosewoody nutmeg and cardamom. I just discovered I like to wear it while I watch a late movie or when I work from home. When I am thinking how I get old, it grounds me. It is a bit outdated already, which means it doesn't engage your brain so much, leaving more space for you. Yet dull it is not. What it brings is assurance. An olfactory hum for the evenings."", 'A prequel to Encre Noire. As in the cinema a saga often sees the birth of very high level ""spin offs"" (see ""Annabelle"" in ""The Conjuring""), Equus is the spin off of the sunny side of Encre Noire. Don\'t use it in winter, you\'ll kill it. Use it when it\'s hot and your body temperature rises a lot. Virile, magnetic, it gives the idea of an earthy and humid herbaceous with flashes of warm light filtering from the branches of the trees. Recently revisited, the bottle is now much prettier, with a decidedly more expressive and slightly thoughtful horse, and the fragrance has more pungent and herbaceous notes, with an even more pronounced woody base. Perhaps the best Lalique perfume, even better than Encre Noire.', ""Citrus, Aromatics & Herbal, Spices with Woods & Vetiver. The Leather is pretty muted in the opening but comes out as it starts to dry down. The Citruses don't stick around all that long at which point it goes more Spicy, Aromatic & Woody. The Violet Leaf does give it a little bit of a Petrol quality. On the far dry down, I get a good dose of ISO E Super which gives this a little bit of a Hamster Cage Shavings vibe, but not in a bad way. Pretty simple but also complex at the same time. This is not a heavy projector or a strong fragrance. It's pretty subtle and understated.  I got a vintage bottle for $35, so the quality is much better than the price tag as with most Lalique fragrances from discounters. I have heard that the newer design doesn't perform (horse printed on the bottle vs etched in on the older bottles) but can't really attest to that. This smells a little old school, since it was released 22 years ago, so I'd say 30 and over would appreciate this more than the younger guys."", 'Those citruses in the opening are bright and the woods mixed with the herby sharpness of the juniper almost has a woody ginger type scent. The citruses fade and it becomes a spicy woody scent, with a sightly piney/herbal crispness. The more it dries down, the more warm and woody it smells, but it keeps a crisp and refreshing backbone all the way throughout. A generous price tag for the quality of the blend. This is an all time favorite for me.', ""Spicy woody, warm, properly sweet, and tender. Towards the end stage the woody bitterness is charming. Redwood and Sequoia are prominent. The cardamom and mace really enthralled my heart.  Projection at about an arm's reach. It's introvert and low-profile, with moderate longevity (longevity is much better on fibre). For moderate or cool temperatures in spring and fall (perhaps in winter too). New bottles have cartoon image that looks so cheap…contra the elegance of the bottle design. $35/75ml is just acceptable, considering the poor performance of EDP version, although the performance may be the necessary side effect of its tenderness."", ""This smells really nice, fresh, and woodsy. It is strong. I got it mainly for the strong juniper note. This is definitely masculine and not anything I'd ever wear out in public or even often at home LOL. Juniper brings me happiness though :)"", ""I must say that I am always dazzled by this number from the sensibly-priced house of Lalique. I have the EDP, and when I apply it, there's a nice rush of citrus and pepper on a bed of fresh juniper wood shavings. It feels rural, countryside, woodsy as all outdoors, Woodsy Owl woodsy, Smokey the Bear woodsy, a horse is a horse of course of course woodsy. I want to wear a Pendleton sweater and throw on my Danner boots, jump in a pick up and choose a Christmas tree.  I have the horse head in-relief bottle; apparently the cartoonish etched horse bottles are a bit of a disappointment to others, but that's just conjecture. This just brings me a smile to my face and a spring to my step, right down to its blurry straw bale vetiver and timbersilk base."", ""What a bizarre assessment by 'StaticCentreHalf'. While the quality of the fragrance and whether it appeals may be all that matters to you, it's certainly not the case for everyone. Believe it or not, there exist people who like pretty things; I count myself as one of them. And although I don't feel as strongly about it as Agent Strong, I do, er, strongly feel that the update to the bottle does take away quite a bit."", ""What a bizarre assessment by 'Agent Strong.' An attractive presentation is nice enough hut wholly irrelevant. The quality of the fragrance and whether it appeals is all that matters; and that is superb - enhancing any pretentious claims (well looked up, by the way) to a legacy."", 'Equus is such a superlative masculine fragrance.  Recently gifted a bottle to a very outdoorsy action-man friend who’s extremely difficult to shop for and who hates most men’s colognes because he despises anything that smells like “perfume”. Equus however he now adores. Probably because his wife told him it was “sexy in a lumberjack kinda way” yet unpretentious and down to earth.  Equus is one of my favourite woodsy frags. Makes me think of mahogany and freshly marquetry.  Equus could of course just as easily be worn by a woman - after all Bois des Iles, Samsara and Fémininité du Bois all shattered the convention of woods being masculine.', ""Bright woody citrus, tart, dry, and aromatic. For 30$ it feels acceptable, however it falls apart on my skin fairly quickly to reveals some woody base notes and some clean, linen like musk with moderate longevity as a skin scent. Not a life changing fragrance, but if you are looking for a fresh, bright woody casual scent this won't disappoint."", ""I've had a bottle of this ever since it was launched. My take on this is that it smells medicinal and dries down to a balm-like effect (the vetiver comes through though). I understand how this is polarizing, but to me it's a love, although admittedly not something I would wear often. Moderate performance, but I think if anyone tried to make it stronger it would lose it's delicate balance. Some perfumes are like that. Coppermann also created Bois d'Iris (Van Cleef), which has a similar delicate balance (different notes of course), and which is a favourite of mine. Hers is a very refined taste."", 'I get fresh spicy pencil shavings', 'On first impression this is a basic fresh woody fragrance. I mostly get citrus, light floral and cedar. It’s nice.

I watched a reviewyoutube on Marco 4 U Perfumes and decided to order it ,I am so happy, 30 box for this quality fragrance!', 'This is a bit of a one dimensional sequoia scent, but it is very well done and unique in its detailed recreation of this particular wood. It is a go-to cold weather casual scent for me—great for flannel shirts, heavy wool sweaters, etc. Very masculine, tasteful, understated. Great value as with most of the Lalique line', 'Purchased blind from a discounter in EDT concentration - based on my experience with Lalique Lion I expect the EDT to have more citrusy brightness and less Iso E Super. Happily the bottle has the horse head in relief, not the newer etched bottle. And it leaves me headache free so the EDT gamble pays out.  Extremely green, slightly sour juniper over pencil shavings and spices. The green and herbal gourmand notes have a savoury quality that can be a little off putting over time. I spray it on my wrists and not my chest. The cedar/juniper/nutmeg gives me strong deja vu for some 2000s Burberry scents, but nicheified here, less identifiable as “cologne”.  The niche-y uniqueness is de rigueur for Lalique. Among their masculines this is a riskier blind buy than the easy-pleasing Lion and Hommage, but ahead of the Encre Noire’s. A springtime forest hike in the Pacific Northwest. Natural, youthful, masculine. Update: I also hiiighly recommend trying this before spending the $$ on Byredo’s Eleventh Hour…', ""I describe Equus as a walk through a high-end horse stable, with just fresh hay and no horses, but idealized with a sprinkle of sugar dust. Also that it's a more affordable, everyday-wear sport version of Creed Royal Oud. So when the new King is coronated he wears Royal Oud. The next day when the King makes his appearance at the polo match, or equestrian show, he wears Lalique Pour Homme Equus. I like Equus better than Encre Noir. And Equus has very little similarity to Oscar for Men (1999), which is a very underrated, spicy citrus fragrance that, in addition to not being boring, was a precursor to both later releases of David Beckham Instinct and Terre d'Hermes.  I have the 3-dimensional etched glass bottles of all three Lalique Pour Homme fragrances."", 'It takes quite a few, few sprays to get any action outta this stuff.. Love the cedar(ish) woods. That is what its all about.  Released around the same time, this reminds me a lot like Oscar for Men, Oscar de Larenta 1999 (the one in frosted bottle) ...which was about the most boring, office-safe fragrance I ever did own. The Equus has more wood notes though. Still searching for a CeDaR-BoMb with some major durability  ---this newer reformulation of Equus is downright terrible. I used a whole bottle in under a month. Conclusion: I have decanted an entire bottle and added cedarwood oil, lemon, cardamom and a few drops of mace. It lasts over a few hours now and still smells the same.', ""To my nose this has some shared DNA with Lalique Pour Homme (lion) EDP. It has a sparkly zing in its opening that is very interesting. It's targeted to younger men in compare to Lion EDP. I personally prefer the lion; it has a deeper character in it that it doesn't feel as strong in this one. Don't get me wrong, this is a great fragrance. Also, the sequoia note in this is very interesting; not to mention also very unique. Overall, it's an awesome release and highly recommended. P.S. it has some similarities to Bvlgari Man in Black in the air to my nose."", ""I love Quorum Silver and TDH so I figured I would like this one. So nice.

I will wear it in the Spring and Fall with great joy."", 'I have new bottle of this with horse head painted over the bottle. I got this as a promotion offer for another order for £12 so I took it. Now what I am really surprised of is the fact that no one listed or mentioned that this is nearly 1:1 copy of Armani eau de Cedre, or should I say Armani is copy of Equus as Lalique was first. When I got this and first sprayed on my forearm I said: ""This is Eau de Cedre"". I also have original Gucci pour homme II (also I). I can get why some people see some similarities because of tea and violet leaf, but that\'s it. Dry down is completely different to my nose. Even take a look at the notes. 1 Head Armani: Bergamot, lemon, sage Equus: Bergamot, lemon, citron 2 Middle Armani: Violet leaf, cardamom, cumin Equus: Violet leaf, cardamom, nutmeg, mace, juniper, Brazilian redwood 3 Base Armani: Black tea, cedar essence, suede, woody notes Equus: Sequoia, vetiver, benzoin, amyris, leather, musk And these actually reflect perfectly how I smell them. Both open with citrussy fresh vibe but Armani has minty airy vibe of sage, where Equus has citrus mixed with juniper. After a while Armani is still lighter and you can smell the cardamom aromatic vibe, with sweet vibe of cumin. Equus is even more aromatic with added more spicy warmth from nutmeg and mace and resin/amber feel like from juniper and redwood (juniper is still strong at this stage). Now dry down is woody and aromatic in both. Armani is more green woods because of black tea. Cedar essence note gives really strong pungent vibe of resin conifers. Sequoia with benzoin and amyris gives nearly same experience. Vetiver here gives little bit earthy feeling but also green grassy like. Armani is smoothed out by some woody notes with suede on later dry down. Equus has leather with musk. This is how I find suede: it\'s leather note with white musk added for softer vibe. Overall these are very, very close in terms of vibe however Armani is much more well blended and last longer. It\'s one of my favourite scents for spring and summer as I am not big fan of citrussy freshies. It\'s also much lighter scent and more uplifting. I would say it\'s more herbal/aromatic and woody where Equus is more woody spicy/aromatic. I recommend to check anyone who has them both.', ""Even though the bottle was depictured as the older one with the relief horse, I received the newer one with the flat motif. People say there was a reformulation as well, so my review is for the newer version.  Equus pour Homme is a fresh, outgoing scent, but not harsh. It has a green vibe, herbal and fruity, without going sweet. The opening is quite citrussy, but the drydown shines with juniper, cardamom and notes of wood and vetiver.The lemon is still there, but it's not dominating the fragrance anymore.  It evokes pictures of strolling across the pasture on a warm summer evening. The sun has been shining all day and now the vegetation exudes all its wonderful scents. Even though, I have these pictures of nature in my mind, Equus is sophisticated, very pleasant and good quality. I can see this being a good fit in any kind of situation. I bought the EdP for my partner, but might just be reaching for it from time to time. I'm not normally into male scents for myself and in my perception this is unmistakably one, but I just like its vibe so much.

It is sweet and fresh at the same time. The scent stays close to the skin (is intimate), performance is the worst thing about this fragrance. But the quality is outstanding. It is a calming, self-soothing scent that gives a Midsummer vibe. I can see why people mention the country side – it smells like that.', ""An awesome classy fresh yet woody spicy fragrance in fact that's an understatement it is a truly regal scent.The spices mix with the vibrant luminous citruses to give off an almost fizz or effervescence and in combination with the strong woods gives a aristocratic presence.Apparently it is similar to Creeds Spice and Wood which I am not sure of but I know one thing this is a quality scent."", ""This was a real disappointment. I'm guessing this was recently reformulated because I got really terrible performance which my bottle which kind of ruined the fragrance for me. I'm not even a guy that cares too much about performance but when you only get 2-3 hours of longevity and pretty much no projection of scent you actually like it's disappointing, to say the least.  The scent itself was also kind of let down but only because I had really high expectations based on reviews I saw said that it smelled like a butsudan. Sorry to say but the newest batches don't come close to that kind of rich woodsy smell. I actually really enjoy the scent as a whole but I guess my expectations were way too high to be impressed on the initial spray.  The opening however I'm not a huge fan of as I got mostly hay and black pepper kind of smell. It quickly dried down to be more green and the dry down is fantastic on this scent. I find this to be a casual spring-fall scent. A scent you wear when you don't feel like wearing a scent as it is really intimate and earthy smelling. I haven't worn this in warm and hot weather yet so hopefully, the warmer weather helps the performance. The scent itself I would give a 7 or 8/10 but the performance is like a 2/10 making it a 5/10 overall. Pretty disappointed. I'll still wear it though."", ""Unpopular Opinion: I have both the older Engraved Horse EDP, and also the newer Cartoon Horse EDP, and I like the scent of the newer version much better.

It's fresh, grassy, hay-like and herbal, I can smell the citron cardamom and mace, and I can detect the vetiver giving a good base. I think there's leather too but it's the idea of leather, not in-your-face, just enough to give this a classic equus vibe like other perfumes in this genre but not over the top. Somewhere horse tack has been but not the horse itself-- just a little animalic. Enough musk underneath to keep it interesting, too. It's not your usual men's cologne, I dare say this isn't going to be popular with the usual fruity young men's crowd that's popular these days. I keep going back to my wrist for more, it's delightful. My only demerit is for the tacky and cheap bottle-- they have really downgraded the presentation on this!

It's a bit more of a sharper woodiness. It doesn't have a great strength, and it is moderately priced. It is unique and a nice change from the typical blue or citrus men's colognes.

If Lalique Encre Noire is dark, rainy nights in a bottle, Lalique Equus is the opposite, sunny days and joy in a bottle"", ""A perfect autumnal fragrance. A little citrus to keep it bright and fresh, and a lot of woods to keep it hearty and cozy. There's a bit of sweetness in it too to keep it a bit on the sexy side. A little more modern than Lion. I honestly love the scent, but it's longevity is a huge short coming. I need to reapply every 4 hours, which for the price isn't a deal breaker. I highly recommend, just don't be afraid to go heavy and reapply as needed."", 'Equus smells (a lot) like a butsudan, the household shrine you find in Japanese homes and triggers flashbacks of cedar, mahogany, red sandalwood, and Palisander rosewood, even though none of these are present. Juniper, redwood, sequoia and amyris (aka ""West Indian sandalwood"") are the actual woods in this, with vetiver and spiced with cardamom, nutmeg and mace, on a resinous foundation of styrax. Fairly linear but if you enjoy woody fragrances this is intoxicating.  The new bottle looks cheap and nasty compared to the original whose horse looked three dimensional, and closer in style to the frosted crystal glasswork for which Lalique is famous. Presumably a cost-cutting measure, since the original bottles must have been expensive to produce - and in commercial perfumery bottles generally cost more to manufacture than their contents. Quite possibly the ultimate woody fragrance - Equus feels more wondrously woody than Wonderwood. A legend that is rightly regarded as a modern classic men’s fragrance.', ""Blind buy based on reviews (thank you!). Blown away by how brilliantly unique this beautiful fragrance is. Initially and very quickly you pick up on the sharp vetiver and sequoia notes dancing with the citrus. It then begins settling down into a spicier, more grounded, even earthier tone. As it calms it gets a bit boozier. Think spiced rums with orange peel - but it isn't soft. It maintains an edge, like a squeeze of lime was thrown in for good measure and the rum you chose was the spiciest they had. As it begins to dry down you start getting more of the cardamom, musk and benzoin with that citrus layer softening.  Longevity is fairly good, lasts most of the day but it does soften quickly. I see this being a go to for spring and autumn, or balmy summer nights to give a bit more of a blast for people sniffing me. Unique, beautiful and a new ongoing one for my collection."", 'It opens with a lemon or tangerine peel near the fireplace. Edgy and a bit smoky. Later you can distinguish the different lighter additives like juniper or violet. At the most it stays woody with burned leathery nuance. It is a nice scent , very dependent on the weather conditions. Good one! At least man pays more for less in the bottle nowadays!!!', 'I adore Equus on a cold Autumn morning when the sillage mixes with the scent of the new day and the smell burning wood stoves wafting through the air. Equus has the ability on me to bring to mind all the wonderful little details of the season that might otherwise go unnoticed in the daily grind.  I have had my bottle (EdP) for almost four years and it just keeps getting better with each passing year, such a beautiful fragrance and a steal at the price you can get it for.', ""Best fragrance I've ever smelled. No joke! I finaly found my signature fragrance!!"", 'I quite like Lalique Pour Homme so blind bought this one. Similar but more of a new leather and tobacco aroma that offers enough to be well worth buying even if you already have Pour Homme. Not an overly strong lasting scent but very nice.', 'If you ever opened a new pack of cigarettes and took a whiff of it, then you are close to knowing how Equus smells. This however is surrounded by citrus and slight sweetness. Tobacco scent without tobacco note. Excellent. Projection is weak after 2 hours; but stays long time (EDP).', 'WOW!! This is full on completely love at first sniff! I find it difficult to pick out specific notes. Though I get a fresh hay-ish note which goes with the horse theme. It is a super smooth fresh-like and elegant fragrance that you would expect from a mature, well off man dressed up in full riding outfit in the stables. Reminds me of a mellowed down smooth Spicebomb. Blind bought as a result of the reviews here, the intruiging equestrian connotation as well as the fantastic horse head engraving on the bottle.', ""This is for the EDP version. Nice dusty citrus...nutmeg...juniper/violet/cardamom.....and the redwood and mace gives it a kick Love at first sniff.....YES!! I slept on this one for fat too long,glad I finally grabbed this one. I do get vibes of Gucci II and also Quorum Silver.....but this goes in it's own direction for sure. Classy....elegant...refined. Easy to like....easy to wear.....GEM. Decent performance on my skin....so far. LOVE !!!!!!!!"", 'Okay, I get the hamster bedding reference that some people mention. But wait 15 mins (after the wet opening) and you will be drawn into a more rich and deep wood-note. One of the reviews below said that they smell a similarity between this and Gucci Guilty Absolute. I kind-of see that, but I feel they are not redundant, and worthy of separate purchases.  That being said, If you own neither Equus EDP or GGA, I would go for the Gucci Guilty Absolute over Equus.', 'هذا العطر قد لا يعجب الكثيرين وانا منهم، حقيقة الرائحة غريبة ومختلفة ولكن ليس بصورة ايجابية، فيه رائحة في العطر مزعجة..  العطر كلاسيكي واصداره في ٢٠٠١، مختلف عن اخوه الآخر رأس الأسد، العطر الآخر حمضي كلاسيكي، هذا مختلف تماماً عن الآخر.. فقط اللي احب أقوله وأكد عليه، جرب العطر قد لا يعجبك واياني واياك تشتريه عمياني، حتى لو سعره رخيص أراه لا يستحق وجهة نظري المتواضعة.. اللهم هل بلغت؟ اللهم فأشهد..', 'EDT is a very nice woody scent, lots of cedar-like depth, slight natural sweetness that is dry and not cloying. Slight tobacco note in the opening, dry down has a surprising coolness to it despite remaining in the cedar realm (although the note is likely the sequoia.) I have the EDT and the EDP. EDT is nice for spring, will have to see how it will do in summer, but it is overall an airier and cooler version, versus the EDP which is richer and warmer. EDP might be better in winter, but I will have to wait to try that out. Overall unique- I’ve not smelled anything similar aside from actual wood shavings. I do not get hamster with this aside from hamster cages using wood shavings; nothing rodent-like about the fragrance itself. (I don’t get any similarity with my Bois de Vetiver unfortunately!)', 'This smells EXACTLY like Karl Lagerfeld Bois de Vetiver, but a tad less sweet. It is a bit more closer to the skin and a bit more smooth. If this one is a bit too smooth/subtle for your taste, try Karl Lagerfeld Bois de Vetiver. You will be pleasantly surprised.', ""This was a blind buy since I love oriental woody and spicy woody fragrances, and I'm quite the fan of mahogany. It certainly didn't disappoint, it's similar to Hugo Boss BOSS Bottled, quite similar quite spicy and woody. Gorgeous fragrance very happy with it, if your thinking about it then don't just buy it. The citrus top works in well and the spices aren't sickling either well balanced and quite classy. And the woodiness is there also super good."", ""Oh yes. One of those scents that takes you somewhere when you take a whiff. The rain has just stopped, the ground is damp and I am walking through haystacks with the sound of cows and chickens nearby... This stuff is amazing! Also - I got the EDP, and the bottle is still engraved with that depth into the bottle, it's beautiful."", ""At long last, something has filled the Gucci Pour Homme II shaped hole in my heart, and I'm overjoyed. Unfortunately, Equus is missing that addictive black tea note from GPHII, as well as a bit of the cinnamon smoothness, but the resemblance is still striking. A homerun from Lalique, typical solid quality considering the price. Also, the bottle is gorgeous! Love the engraving."", 'Amazing! So different than other fragrances around. Lalique never disappoint! Fist time i thought i EDT is better than EDP. After giving some more time on the EDP, i start liking it more! Anyone should try this for spring.', ""I blind bought this based on the note breakdown after buying Encre Noire and Encre Noire Sport and being really impressed by the brand. After wearing Equus a couple of times, I bought 2 more backup bottles. I love this stuff. To provide some perspective, I'm not a fan of the typical summer citrus scents. They tend to have poor performance and they all smell pretty similar which makes them boring. Basically if you've smelled one you've smelled them all. I'm also not a fan of the modern trend toward sweet fragrances for men. Call me a middle aged old man but to me, men are supposed to smell like woods and leather and smoke and the great outdoors, not bubblegum and grape soda and flowers. Also, the sweet stuff is sort of sickening after a while. But I'm also a fan of Fahrenheit, Kouros, Quorum, One Man Show, Bentley Absolute, Gucci Guilty Absolute, and Bvlgari Man Black Orient. Take that for whatever it's worth. So I was thrilled with Encre Noire Sport. That's a wearable summer option that no one will confuse with a unisex fragrance. When I saw the note breakdown for Equus and an EDP concentration, I had high hopes that this would be another winner from Lalique.  Wow! This is a home run for me. This has become my signature scent for spring, summer, and fall. There is nothing sweet here. Yeah, there's some citrus in the opening but that is NOT what this fragrance is about. And forget about picking out individual notes. It's an experience. It feels like you've just come in from the horse barn after spreading fresh hay in hot weather. It feels like you're walking up a mountain trail just after snow melt in the spring. It feels like fall right before the leaves drop and you're cutting spruce with a chainsaw. It does NOT smell like something your girlfriend or wife will want to borrow. As for performance, It's moderate. I get about 5-6 hours. But projection and sillage drop pretty fast after about an hour. That's fine for me. I don't need beast mode and it makes Equus more wearable. I can always replenish if I want. Quality is super high. There is nothing cheap or synthetic smelling here. At the price you can get this at discounters this is another steal from Lalique."", 'Oh my lord what a wonderful unique hidden gem this is! I managed to get a bottle with the engraved / etched horse and the reviews below have certainly been more accurate than expected.  It has that wonderful semi damp straw / wood smell that you get in a horse stable, I cannot relate to the so called hamster smell as I have never had one.  This would be a splendid Spring scent through and through the citrus opening starts full on but lingers through the mid nicely to the dry down. Rocobar by Hermés smells slightly similar (which is a big compliment) but it does not have the strong citrus and juniper notes that this has, the dry down here is just gorgeous.  I would see this as day time casual wearing fragrance, perfect for smart casually dressed man.  Although it has deeper notes, it manages to stay fresh and clean so very impressed.', ""I love this blend of juniper and cardamon, which reminds me of Hermes d'Voyage. However I understand that my EDP is a pale reformulation of some previous gorgeous fragrance (the colour of which was pinkish comparing to its reformulation).  I mark it as unisex fragrance as I wear masculine woody fragrances. This one is not heavy at all, there is a breeze in it.  In the Baltic online shops you still can get the flacon with an engraved horse head. But on the Lalique site it is already redesigned. What a shame to redesign a perfect classical flacon!! Btw, a metal part of my flacon is defected: it moves freely on the glass part.  Some say, Lalique house was sold :( Too many good things with old traditions are ended by stupid marketing."", 'This one smells very modern even though it is 20 years old!  According to my nose the 2017 Joop\'s masculine release named ""WOW!"" was strongly influenced by this one; they are quite close indeed, but I clearly prefer the latter. The bottle has no longer the head of the horse embossed on the front side (unfortunately) - now it is painted (I know for a fact, I bought mine today) and I am rather disappointed. Someone at Lalique must realise that while the perfume is not unique, the bottle is (or, was) and it is a wrong decision to change the element that characterises this product, the most!', ""Love this green fresh little bit aromatic scent from Equus. The bootle is a glassware masterpiece. Probably my fave juniper notes perfume. It's afforfablr, but i wish it will be last longer on my skin. Only 3 hours performance is my only cfitics."", '...i really did blind-buy this because of that beautiful horse’s head etched into the glass! and being born into a year-of-the-horse just sealed the metaphorical deal! fully expected a common, perhaps wearable vanity fragrance meant only to hold the bottle together...Equus is so much better and more than that...a masculine woodsy spicy oriental fragrance that gives you all that but in an edt concentration just right in texture and weight...', ""I blind bought this several years ago because of the horse etching on the bottle. But I love the fragrance itself, far more than I expected to. It's fresh like a forest, yet spicy. Clean, brisk, wonderful, so unlike anything else I have. Great for waking the senses yet relaxing. One of my favorites. Does not smell like a horse, and I don't associate forest smells like the cedar and spices with horses at all. A horsey smell could be great: leather, hay, molasses, and horse sweat. But this is not like that. Equus is super super fresh and spicy. The bottle is gorgeous and so is the scent. Lalique never disappoints."", ""Amazing fragrance! Elegant, Classy and Sophisticated. The scent is spicy- woody but is not heavy. This perfume has a well-balanced composition . The Sequoia note is dominant in this scent. It opens up with like warm spicy then dry down is musky woody. It smells so good and reminds me of walking through the forest of the Giant Sequoia trees. The art of bottle design is very wonderful. Lalique Equus is suitable for the spring ,fall and winter. I really enjoy it and I love Lalique Pour Homme EQUUS EDT. I'm so glad that I have it in my collection.  TWO THUMBS UP.  Rating : 9 / 10"", ""Spice bomb opening, Issey Miyake L'eau Bleue Pour Homme middle, and Encre Noir dry down."", ""The most prominent component is a mild cedar/redwood scent, but aside from that Equus doesn't hit me with strong individual notes. This is a more gentle blend of scents, that develops and gets richer over time. Though it starts out as a simple dry woody scent, other notes (spice, leather and resins, I guess) emerge over time and make the blend warmer and sweeter. By the end of the day, I feel like I'm ensconced in a comfortable leather club chair by the fire in an Alpine chalet."", 'Walking through an old sequoia forest, surrounded by those massive trees. You are dwarfed by their girth and height. Maybe it rained a day or two before. The floor carpeted with dead fallen pine leaves that feel cushy underfoot. Rays of sunlight that stream through the dense foliage, twinkling off drops of dew. Back at the lodge, you have all the creature comforts of a luxury hotel. It has the Lalique pepper/ make-up box signature that I also get in Lalique White. Easy to wear for a spicy fragrance without being aggressive or overly masculine. Noble but with a little bit of posh.', 'I do have to agree with the ""hamster cage"" opening, but give the juice 15 minutes to relax on your skin, and you will start to really appreciate it! I will definitely make this one a regular starter!', ""EDT new bottle review. Why do they hide this? It's a knockout. By all means get the engraved bottle EDT.

Then I went to their website and it's like the one I bought, the horse is stamped on the back and it looks cheap. I wonder if it was reformulated as well. Does anyone know anything about that? Thanks. This one is similar to Gucci PH II, which is a masterpiece and discontinued. This one is more intense and i smell some smoky/grilled peppers (from sequoia or mahagony idk) similar to Orto Parisi Terroni. Also if you like violet leafs just blind buy it, it's cheap. Edit: Equus is the father of Spicebomb and Bvlgari In Black"", 'Smells like ointment that you use to rub on sore muscles...probably because of the mace note, which give this a very menthol-y aroma.

The pepper in this smells so freshly ground(I love pepper as a note). But what I found interesting was that at times if I put my nose to my arm I wouldn't smell anything but at other times when I was going about my day, I got whiffs of woods and pepper.

This is an instant yes for me. I adore Spicebomb, and this definitely reminds me of that, but my husband also detected some Cowboy Grass in it, which is also another love for me. The reviewer below me mentioned Tonka Imperiale and Spiriteuse by Guerlain- this all just goes to show this is a very very high quality smelling fragrance. This may be the best cheap blind buy I’ve ever made. Also, I really like the bottle.', ""I purchased this perfume (Lalique Equus EDP) for my husband and when he wore it, it reminded me of something between Guerlain Spiritueuse Double Vanille and Tonka Imperiale. Spicy, oriental and unisex. Dries down to a soft, spicy, resinous, warm scent with moderate projection. Better suited to cooler weather in fall/winter. I'll be keeping an eye on this one. Equus has that familiar DNA that I found in other Lalique fragrances. That vetiver/lavender/vanilla/pepper that I sense in Satine, Living and somewhat in Mon Guerlain. If you like that corner of perfumery, then you'll appreciate this one. In the end, I took this from my husband. It's more my style of perfume ;)."", ""Beautiful bottle, looks great with the right lighting around it. As for the fragrance, it's nice, fresh & rural. For me it conjures images of Western Europe in centuries past. Not for everyone but the originality of it (and the bottle) mean it's a permanent member of my collection."", 'I got the EDT. It\'s more airy than I expected and this quality makes it signature-scent worthy and suitable all year-round. The juniper note, which gives a fizzy,gin & tonic smell with berry undertones is actually the most prominent player to my nose. For some reason, this part of the scent causes a small gag-reflex for me. The saving grace was the so-called ""hamster-cage"" smell that others below have mentioned but sadly, it\'s never in the forefront of the EDT. I wish it was because that exotic ""sequoia"" wood smell is so unique and addicting - I hope it\'s more prominent in the EDP. Despite the juniper aspect of this fragrance not agreeing with me, I still know this is another great and unique release from Lalique. Sample both the EDT & EDP and decide which one works for you.

(Emilie Bevierre Coppermann, 2001) Scentrack: Jakatta – The Other World In my opinion Lalique is one of the most underappreciated fragrance houses. Lalique always delivers well-composed imaginative creations for a good price. Just to mention Encre Noire, Hommage a l’Homme, Hommage a l’Homme Voyageur, Perles, Amethyst, Ombre Noire... Yes, performance is sometimes subpar, but no one could deny their timeless beauty and sophistication. Equus is the typical story of Lalique fragrance. Launched too early, nicely polished, reminiscent of a classic era and completely under the radar. It opens with a certain Asian citrus touch that almost immediately transforms in spice cabinet nutmeg and cardamom. This introduction is rounded by juniper with gin qualities and just a hint of green violet leaf. Then gradually morphs in woody phase characterized by the guitar rosewood, subtle vetiver and musk. In the base there is also a touch of gentle powder. The most impressive is the connection between the name and the composition. From the first smell Equus transported me way back in the past, directly in the circus. Although it is clean, polite and well groomed, underneath the surface is a funky animal hidden note, probably by the usage of some woods. Equus is very natural smelling composition. Relaxing as a walk through a peaceful forest on a sunny day. The sun is muted by ancient trees, but still bright enough to enjoy the walk. A composition that came out too early. Later this theme will be relaunched in a denser way inside Spicebomb and Bvlgari Man in Black. It has some qualities of radiant Perles, but still, it is not its male counterpart. A beautiful woodsy fougere that confirms my theory that 2000s were the most creative years for perfumes.

I detected moderate to heavy pepper upon initial sprays that reminded me of Lalique White, though I don't recall pepper being a note listed for Equus. The pepper remains through dry down to skin scent with citrus as a minor player. Like many others, I also sense the hay and cedar upon dry down and skin scent mode. A faint whisper of violet upon deep inhalation. Minimal sillage and projection on my skin. I would absolutely not worry about over spraying this and in all seriousness, that may be required for even minimal projection. Unfortunately, this will be located near the back of my collection due to the overly strong pepper I sense."", ""Lalique Pour Homme Equus is an aromatic gourmand. It opens with a mellow sweet bakery spice, combined with deep woods that add strong character and sophistication. It is a masculine feel-good aroma. The touch of spices is very comforting. I think the equilibrium is prime—in that it feels mature—but isn't dated or entirely vintage in any way. It's a modern mature feeling that it gives off. I do get a subtle resemblance to Spicebomb. It's certainly there, but the fragrance has so much unique quality about it you can't entirely make that relation. Mace is certainly the key player. It has a cinnamon-ish essence—with a hayish character to it. The juniper berries add a bit of tartness to the aroma—it furthers the sophistication in my opinion. Not a bad touch at all. I think Lalique are experts at making fragrances that are simple, yet sweet—and this would definitely be another fancy offering of that sort. Certainly worth every bit of the $20.00 dollars you'll pay for it on the gray market. I can't say that it begins to be worth the $115.00 dollars asked for on the official Lalique website though.

Alone, this would make for a very interesting and polarizing niche fragrance. But what the designer has done here is knock that woodsiness down a couple of pegs and warm it up with just enough spice (nutmeg, mace, cardamom) and benzoin to round its edges nicely. To this, she also added a potent balance of citrus that puts a very clean and natural lemon in the lead for a good while. The result of this alchemy is something that is light, fresh and airy for a wood-forward scent, but that lingers longer than you might think.

Initially sweetish, spicy and cedary, it dries down to a spicy sandalwood that is quite lovely. Smells favorably in quality to Bois de Portugal, though the profile is different.

The cardamom and impression of leather fades and develops into a soft and fresh spiced wood that some hours later - first sprayed at night and still present the next morning - changes into a sweet and balsamic resinous scent. Lalique Equus is definitely for the over-30s and could be worn for most occasions, day or night; noticeable but not obnoxious for the office and intriguing for evening wear or a date. Very few perfumers make non-linear fragrances these days - a perfume that really evolves as you wear it - but I’m glad Lalique is one of them because they do it damned well.', 'Another winner from Lalique! really love this one. find it sufficiently sophisticated and understated that it can work in the office, but the woods and spices scream to be worn outdoors. very well blended and very good longevity on my skin. the citrus evaporates quickly to the aforementioned woods and spices that create a very addictive sillage that makes me continuously sniff my wrist.', ""I have been waiting to try this one, since a lot of people suggested me to try this one when I was looking for a cedar-dominant fragrance (I know this one is sequoia based, but many say it is similar). Well, in my case, I get mostly juniper (which I have found I really dislike, too astringent to my nose) with some spices, I get cinnamon, which reminds me of Spicebomb (could be the nutmeg). Once it dries down, you're left with sweet spices and some woodyness in the background. I get about 4 hours with soft projection, which is fine, since Equus is quite cheap. In the end, this is not for me, smells a bit mature for me and quite cheap. However, if you are a manly man in his 30's-40's, do check it out, it could be a nice day/work scent."", ""Equus is the best spicy woody fragrance I've tried. It feels grown-up. More sophisticated. Somehow less mass-produced. More like a creation from the mind of a talented artisan. Not sure what sequoia smells like, but the combination of woods, leather, violet leaf and spice notes exude quality at every stage. The sillage and longevity seem unremarkable for an EdP. In both respects one can't help but wonder if this is a permanent legacy of IFRA. Heavy application doesn't make an obvious improvement. I would describe it as average in this respect. For comparisons, there are vague suggestions of Gucci PH 2 and surprisingly perhaps Dior Fahrenheit Le Parfum (deep into its dry down) no doubt because they are rich in the commonality of violet leaf which in the case of Equus is a heavenly presence throughout. The bottle has a decent heft with a contrasting frosted horse head emblem recessed within the clear casted glass flacon. It looks classy. The gold crenelated lid appears threaded and heavy but is in fact a light and strong plastic that is removed by a simple pull. Whilst well received when worn, I feel this EdP is compromised by it's sillage and longevity - though I acknowledge the experience of others differs. The scent itself is nothing less than excellent, and the current online price represents good value. Definitely recommendable."", ""Spicy Woody Goodness I'm surprised to find a lot of people complaining about the longevity of this fragrance. Maybe you need to confirm if you have the EDT or EDP because the 75ml EDP bottle I have has brutal longevity. It lasts easily 12+ hours on my skin and clothes. I received this as a gift and didn't expect much but boy was I wrong. I will definitely be buying another bottle for myself soon. My ratings below;  Scent: 8/10 Longevity: 9.5/10 Sillage: 6.5/10 Bottle: 6/10 Compliments: Haven't worn this enough to know."", ""30+ men fragrance. A lot extraordinary things are happening there in the middle notes, there's kind of hard to describe ingredients in this mixture as it smells so good together. It's like why would you say it's juniper, mace, cardamon etc. it's just Lalique Equus. Then comes great Base - with luxurious woody /leathery/soapy musk. I wish it had better performance and sillage. It's kind of delicate unfortunatelly, but everytime you smell yourself - you feel the class. 8.5/10"", ""In the last three days i revisited my Lalique collection and it's fascinating to trace the line from the first Pour Homme (Lion) through Le Faune and Equus to its White culmination (which to me is the best of the four) Equus is reminiscent of White (if not in smell - though there are plenty of similarities) in its therapeutical effect. It is a soothing scent. Yet it does have a transitional character, feels a bit incomplete. It is Two Towers to White's Return of the King. On its own it stands as an atypical spicy woody scent that could have been one of Etro's. A decently nice scent that is comforting and easy to wear. As number three in the line it is the logical and excellent connection of Le Faune with White. ***(**)"", ""This is ok at best but nothing to write home about. It begins with a very nice smelling citrus (bergamot mainly) blend with a faint peppery undertone. But on the drydown (within a few minutes) the scent becomes one of realistic wood accord (I'm guessing this is the sequoia) with sweet nutmeg and violet leaf. The overall impression oddly is of a cappaccino. After a while, it ends up smelling like vanilla-musk but with violet leaf (it's very boring to my nose and I'm not a huge fan). There are some notes I absolutely love in all their incarnations (like neroli) while others I just plain cannot stand if they are too prominent - and violet leaf is one of them. Hence, I'm not a huge fan of this fragrance. Sillage is moderate as is longevity (on the lower end for a eau de parfum). People who love wood colognes will probably like this a lot. But to me it smells like a refined version of Quorum Silver. It's a like, not a love. 3.5/5"", ""I get a peppery sequoia smell out if this, which I love, thought I do wish it were more complex. It has better longevity on me in warm weather (I'm at about hour seven and still getting whafts) and it's got the perfect moderate sillage. This was a blind buy and I'm pretty happy with it TBH."", ""I have no idea why this edp has 4.2 rating. I could give 3/10. Nothing special (one of million-I couldnt recognise what makes it special/different), vety poor/weak smell and changed in to strong spicy after some time. It was blind buy and I regret for this so much... even my friend that likes this kind of parfumes doesn't like it. I asked more men.. and they didn't like it..."", ""I had a sample of the fragrance in EDT, and the performance was very poor, so bought a bottle of EDP.  The performance difference is huge - with 2 sprays sillage and longevity are increased drastically. Someone said this smelled like a chicken salad and mayonnaise sandwich - oddly, this is true. It also smells a bit like crayons, and a bit like pencil shavings - there is a woody/plastic aspect to it but overall it actually smells very natural.  Good for casual wear - an artistic, laid back fragrance. I would not wear to serious occasions - this is too woodsy and rustic.  If you imagine combining the smell of liquorice, cedar and raw tobacco, that's similar to this. It has a lot of similarity with Parfum d'Homme by Montana."", 'An outstanding fragrance...i love it more and more each time i use this one! This is really a very pleasant smell. I only have one bottle and i will have to purchase one more...or i will have to save it with a lot of affection!Lalique made a really well done job. But, unfortunately, has failed a lot to allow the discontinuation of this gem.', ""A very daring fragrance.  For me I get smoke, the dry down of a cedar note and a dry animalisitic note. This fragrance reminds me of a dry, maybe abandoned, ranch that used to have horses or cattle.  I get 4 to 6 hours and projection is moderate light, but the smell is distinctive so I will get more noticed than that.  I cannot think of a appropriate time to wear this besides hiking, camping, or at some replica or presentation for civil war reenactments or the like.

Three hours max.', ""Lovely smooth and slightly sweet woods. Not generic woods - the smells of nature. It's very similar to Carbone de Balmain, but deeper and less dry. This was certainly ahead of the curve for 2001. Really, Lalique can do no wrong in my eyes."", 'I got the chance finally to put my hand this beautiful scent, that I was running after since quiet long time. Dominated by spices (cardamom,nutmeg) and woody notes, I have 3 words to describe it: Classy, Elegant and mature scent. I have 3 Lalique perfumes other than this one, packaging, bottles, caps, juice color ..... are just perfect, which make each one of them an art work, but this one for me is a MASTERPIECE.', 'Very similar to Zara’s Casual Spice. I mean almost identical. The wood notes are there and they linger, I might say, even longer than the Lalique ones! I was actually pleasantly surprised by Zara on this one.', ""It's one of those unusual fragrances that you never smell anything like it before. You are used to the fresh citrus smells from 2000' like Versace Eau Fraiche, Coolwater copycats, heavy classics from the 80', many perfumes beares the same vibe. Equus is not one of them. You won't find anything similar.  For me the scent is fantastic and exquisite. The only thing that bothers me is the performance - longevity and sillage seems to be not satysfying, although this opinion is based only on sample."", 'I live in the Mountain West and know the ""Mountain high-country-classy"" vibe very well and love it. I think DrNDJas\'s review nailed it....lol! Equus also reminds me of the Oregon High Desert where I grew up.  This is just a flat out beautiful fragrance and I can\'t recommend it enough. Grab a bottle the first chance you get.', 'If you’ve ever been to the USA mountain west (Wyoming, Utah, Colorado), there exists a aesthetic of country/rustic posh: grand cabins, lots of natural wood, exposed log beams, expensive hand-made leather boots- think Jackson Hole, Park City, Aspen. This fragrance captures this vibe so well. It’s very woody- cedar up front (sequoia?), loads of it, evoking the favored building material of these places. At certain times when I wear this, the nutmeg and cardamom become prominent, lending depth and warmth to the composition. Just enough leather to toughen it up, but balanced by the violet leaf so it isn’t rugged. Mountain high-country-classy: you wear cowboy boots, but those $2000 hand-stitched pair of Luccheses ain’t ever kicked a pile of cow sh**. Oh, no sir.  Incredible quality, fantastic fragrance by Lalique. My love for this fragrance is rivaled only by my love for my Ford F-150 King Ranch.', 'This is a fantastic classy woody, herbal scent which works exceptionally well in the cooler months. The drydown is incredibly smooth and well balanced, every note seems to sit in the composition perfectly which creates a warm alluring scent. Great longevity and moderate sillage with 2 sprays. Top quality scent which could quite easily justify a much higher price tag.  Impressive stuff from Lalique 8/10', ""Here's my take on the EDP: heavy cedar, some pine, mild spices in the background. Overall, a scent good for the fall and feels like it fits best outdoors. A scent for a hike in the fall foliage in New England or upstate New York.  A few said it smells like a hamster cage. Can't deny the similarities as hamster bedding is often simply wood shavings (and Equus definitely is wood-dominant, especially in the dry down). But that comes off as very negative and this is a pleasant overall scent.  A 7/10 for me. Good buy if you have $30 to spend and want something for the fall that'll be a great match to your Barbour jacket and Chelsea boots."", 'Lalique Pour Homme Equus ... A special serene fragrance that has become something of an escape for me. I visualize an 18th century South American plantation home in a mountainous forest overlooking the ocean. The windows of the expansive mahogany-paneled kitchen are always open, allowing the familiar cardamom, nutmeg, and mace to mingle with the rare forest foliage and exotic woods outside ... as cool ocean breezes weave through formal gardens of boxwood, juniper, and arborvitae. Civilized and unique, yet very natural. I find Equus the most uplifting and pleasing of all Laliques. The downside is this eau-de-parfum does not feel any stronger than most of my EDTs. In some cases ... weaker. I wish I could amplify it because I find myself spraying lots and not much is lasting. Maybe that will change in the cooler months ... hoping so because this beautiful scent is a new favorite.', ""This is a great woody floral musk, and it's one of the best values in the fragrance market, niche quality and composition, very unique and beautiful woods, realistic, yet overall very aromatic. Get the EDP version so it lasts decently. And it's a great Fall fragrance."", ""Horse urine ? Really ? Everyone asking me what it is, this is remarkable smell for such a good price . I don't understand some negative comments about this perfume. I bought this and love from first spray."", ""I have the Encre noir, White and a couple of others from Lalique. Since I love the others and have read everything about this fragrance I blind bought this one. I don't know if this frangance 'simply' is very special. But this one is Definitely not for me."", ""I blind bought Equus for two reasons, I was impressed with Encre Noir, and the price. This EDP was under $30 when I bought it. For that price, I took a chance, I should have bought two bottles. Some fragrances grow on you over time, some stand out right away. This one was love at first sniff. Sure, you can break down the notes and try to decide what's the main note, but why? It smells so good, and it's unique. It's one of the few fragrances I have been complimented on, and once another man asked me what I was wearing and where he could get it.  If you can find a good deal on it, try it."", 'After reading all the comments and since I like Encre Noire I bought the Equus EDP blind - expecting a dry, very masculine scent. Boy was I disappointed - this is a comparatively sweet scent and more on the feminine side of unisex in my opinion (and the opinion of my colleagues). I gave the bottle (which is really nice and heavy) to a coworker, since she liked the scent and could see herself wearing it.', ""Woody, musky horse urine. Essence of horse stable in a pleasant way. I can understand the comparison to Creed's Spice and Wood similarities. Spice and Wood is fresh and somewhat energizing to the senses..... Equus is darker more leathery-like than woody (yet still woody).... and yeah, with the horse urine-like vibe. :) Not bad. If you wear a leather jacket, this is very complimentary. Will give it an extra dimension."", ""Another winner from Lalique. Equus is a spicy, woody fragrance. The sequoia note is very prominent and natural smelling. This is a unique fragrance due to the sequoia base, sets it apart from wood notes you usually encounter like cedar. Longevity is good for me. Projection is on the light side but it's noticeable throughout the day."", ""Unpleasant concoction which smells like a chicken, capsicum and basil salad.  This juice is an absolute travesty. No self-respecting human being should want to smell like this. I imagine there are straight guys who mistakenly believe it could be good/masculine to smell like this, rather than smelling of flowers. Wrong. Women don't want you to smell like savoury rice."", ""The opening is dominated initally by an oil paint and turpentine smell - and the impression of pepper. Whatever citrus is there is understated and is just smoothing off the introduction rather than giving an opening blast. This gives way to mostly vetiver in the heart, and the dry down is woody.  This is a very non-linear scent. It's very complex, very earthy but refined, and I would say very masculine, owing mostly to the prominent vetiver. The evergreen notes are gorgeous - all deep smelling, nothing anywhere near the air freshener piney type. It reminds me of my grandad, who is a painter and a carpenter, and smoked rollups. Oil paints, tobacco, and cut wood from a deep forest."", ""This smells exactly like being on a newly-built cedar deck overlooking a fern-carpeted valley under a pine forest canopy after a rain shower while sipping a gin and tonic from the well-oiled saddle of your recently shampooed horse. Everybody's been there, right? ;) In other words, a really unique scent - if you enjoy fragrances that give you a specific experience, and you think you'd enjoy the experience above, run don't walk to get a bottle of this. I agree with gedlive's comment below - this is an exceptional cedar/woody-aromatic that will reallyshine in cool-to-cold weather, it's an obscenely good deal. Lalique strikes again."", ""To me this smells like trees in a forest mixed with petrol and pepper. It is actually quite sweet and its longevity is 8hrs on my skin.

Overall 8/10"", 'Smells like stale cigarettes. If you are not a smoker then people will think you are if you wear this. Gave me a headache.', ""I've had this one for a few weeks now and I have to say I wasn't a huge fan at first. It has however grown on me. Its a comforting smell that has something to it that seems just slightly feminine to me. for that reason, i don't wear it out very often. That said, it really has grown on me a lot. sometimes I'll just spray just a bit on my wrist before bed."", ""After use this one... whatever is happening = make me crazy amorist ❤❤❤ it  Thank you @mojtaba..

Equus is woody, crisp, fresh, and light.  This is one of the ideal scents you'd want to be wearing as a man on a beautiful summer day. The best way I can describe this scent is to imagine you're walking down a path next to the ocean. There are large trees around and the wind is blowing slightly. It's about 2pm in the afternoon. You're wearing a white cotton collared button down and youre with your woman who's wearing a straw hat, also wearing white. You're just waking, enjoying the landscape, laughing and being; you feel free. That's what equus is to me. Maybe to Lalique it's the feeling of riding a horse and having the wind blow past you and all the scents that are captured in the air. 10/10.. could be worn spring, summer, fall. Summer will be ideal I imagine."", 'I have a bottle with a few sprays missing if anyone is interested in a swap. It smells good, just not for me.', 'Equus is my favorite frag from Lalique. I used to think He Wood Rocky Mountain was comparible to Equus, but now after 200 reviews and mostly a niche collection, I have gotten rid of He Wood, and continue to grow in my appreciation of Equus; the best woody floral I can think of. The woods are very realistic, the amyris, sequoia, and other woody notes, then I get violet leaf and musk. The other notes are nuances, the nutmeg and cardomom add some nice spiciness. Very unique and well blended. If this is getting disscontinued it will be missed, and prices will go up, as we try to get the remaining bottles on ebay... Yes, this reminds me of Creed Spice and Wood that sells for $1,000/ bottle. I did a side by side this morning, comparing Spice and Wood with Equus. Spice and wood may be the best cedar scent in the world, as Creed Boise du Portugal has the best sandalwood. They are most similar because of the stark, realistic woodiness. Spice and wood has a bit of apple and bergamot to brighten the woods and a bit of spice, very simple beautifull fragrance. Equus has that stark woodiness I like in colder weather, yet the composition, with the violet leaf, nutmeg, mace, and some benzoin richness, I think Equus may be the better, more enjoyable scent. Performance and quality are better with Spice and Wood. I would like to get Spice and Wood someday to cap off my collection, maybe when I retire... Rating: 9/10 Merry Christmas. John 3:16', 'Three words...amazing, fantastic, Unique!', 'This one of my favorites from Lalique and if it is discontinued I need to start restocking on it. Awesome fragrance for anytime and any season.', 'DISCONTINUED!! Sadness...', 'Rockstar..!! Different and unique – definitely a “best kept secret” in the fragrance community. The blend of juniper, floral, and woodsy notes of Lalique’s Pour Home Equus is fantastic. I will also add that it is so different/unique, I find it addictive – I am routinely lifting my arm, hoping to catch a lingering hint of this beauty that I sprayed on the cuff of my sleeve. While I am a fan of this fragrance, I am somewhat disappointed in the performance. Equus lasted about 4 hours on me and a bit longer on my clothing. After the first hour, projection dissipates to skin level. Geared more for fall and winter wear, Equus is office safe and will be a crowd pleaser. My final tally for this gem is 4.5 stars out of 5. If performance was greater, this could easily fall into the Top 5 fragrances. Regardless, this juice is good - Equus is modestly priced, smells great, and carries a positive aura about it that says, “life doesn’t have to be perfect to be wonderful”… You will notice the confidence when wearing. Highly recommend adding to any collection. Enjoy your day and happy fragrance hunting…', 'Very wood, and very strong (EDP).

She must me an aline then :D Guy if you want to feel sexy, classy, elegant. It is the ONE!', ""The opening smells like you're in a really nice forest, but not a piney one, with a great cologne on. Love it! And that later it just smells like a really nice forest once the fruits wear off. This is my favorite outdoorsy scent, even better than He Wood Rocky Mountain, IMO. The longevity is pretty good which is great because this IS a smell I like to find on my old clothes. That wonderful tree, sap, juniper smell that is perfectly balanced and enjoyable, comforting, like a big hug from a forest. 8.5/10 overall and 10/10 when I factor in the price. Great value as of now."", 'Lalique Equus is a gift to the lover of dark woody scents like the much-lamented Yves Saint Laurent M7. The bottle is heavy and beautiful with the horse head etched deeply into the back of the glass. From the perfume top I get very little citrus and a huge blast of nutmeg. After a short while, the nutmeg recedes a bit (or perhaps my nose adapts to it) and blends with the other spices and violet leaf and strong dark woody notes to give a beautiful and long-lasting heart. I think ""sequoia"" is a reasonable description of this heart, though don\'t think sequoia or redwood trees yield any commercial oils and I hope that these rare and magnificent trees are not cut down for our vanity. Based on Lalique\'s note list, I suspect the ""sequoia"" is a combination of nutmeg, mace, cedar, and amyris (similar to sandalwood), or perhaps the whole mirage is from combined synthetics. Whatever the composition, it is magnificent and unique to my experience. The spicy notes last a remarkably long time, but eventually they do give way to a milder but still rich cedar and benzoin base, with a bit of musk, leather, and vetiver. The base is very nice, but the unusually long-lasting heart is what shines in this work of art. It feels ferocious, contemplative, tenebrous, radiant, earthy, and pure by turns. If you have admired Yves Saint Laurent M7 or Dior Fahrenheit Absolute or any other dark woody scent, or even think you might admire them, you should sample Lalique Equus.', ""This smells exactly like being on a newly-built cedar deck overlooking a fern-carpeted valley under a pine forest canopy after a rain shower while sipping a gin and tonic from the well-oiled saddle of your recently shampooed horse.

You start enjoying Equus from the moment you open the box, then the bottle and the smell... the mind anticipates and create the illusion that you are already getting the sequoia note (or actually get it, if you have already spray it). That woodsy note is present through all the experience, deserves a full review and provides Equus whit an earthy and balmy odor profile. Yes it's wood, but You know it's a very special one.  Maybe it's me, but in the opening I get a lot of nutmeg and juniper, not the citruses. On the dry down there's no leather or musk note, but the effect is there, the composition get very sensual and some animal, then the citruses and cardamom appear. This is sensual in a very smooth and elegant way. Duration is very good, when you wake up, a little bit of the base is there, not in your wrist, but there it is. Sillage is moderate, but the two fragances I own from Lalique has this thing I really like: hours later a note escape from time to time, you get close to your wrist and nothing, but then again, another note escape. Not for a blind buy, but I strongly recommend the experience. *** Ahora mismo uso LPH Equus y lo que más me gusta es la calidad. Comienzas a disfrutar Equus desde el momento en que abres la caja, luego la botella y el olor... la mente se anticipa y crea la ilusión de que ya estás obteniendo la nota de secuoya (o así es, si ya has utilizado la botella). Esa nota amaderada está presente durante toda la experiencia y merece su propia revisión, al tiempo que le da a Equus un perfil olfativo térreo y balsámico. Sí, es madera, pero sabes que se trata de una muy especial. Quizá sea yo, pero en la apertura percibo mucha nuez moscada y junípero, pero no cítricos. En el secado no hay nota de piel o musk, pero su efecto está ahí. La composición se pone muy sensual y algo animal, entonces aparecen los cítricos y el cardamomo. Es una sensualidad discreta y elegante. La duración es muy buena, cuando despiertas, un poco de la base sigue ahí, no en tu muñeca, pero está ahí. La proyección es moderada, pero las dos fragancias que tengo de Lalique tienen eso que realmente me gusta: horas después una nota escapa de cuando en cuando, te acercas a la muñeca y nada, pero entonces de nuevo, otra nota escapa. No recomiendo una compra a ciegas pero sí y mucho, la experiencia."", ""I blind bought this based on the note breakdown after buying Encre Noire and Encre Noire Sport and being really impressed by the brand. After wearing Equus a couple of times, I bought 2 more backup bottles. I love this stuff. To provide some perspective, I'm not a fan of the typical summer citrus scents. They tend to have poor performance and they all smell pretty similar which makes them boring. Basically if you've smelled one you've smelled them all. I'm also not a fan of the modern trend toward sweet fragrances for men. Call me a middle aged old man but to me, men are supposed to smell like woods and leather and smoke and the great outdoors, not bubblegum and grape soda and flowers. Also, the sweet stuff is sort of sickening after a while. But I'm also a fan of Fahrenheit, Kouros, Quorum, One Man Show, Bentley Absolute, Gucci Guilty Absolute, and Bvlgari Man Black Orient. Take that for whatever it's worth. So I was thrilled with Encre Noire Sport. That's a wearable summer option that no one will confuse with a unisex fragrance. When I saw the note breakdown for Equus and an EDP concentration, I had high hopes that this would be another winner from Lalique.  Wow! This is a home run for me. This has become my signature scent for spring, summer, and fall. There is nothing sweet here. Yeah, there's some citrus in the opening but that is NOT what this fragrance is about. And forget about picking out individual notes. It's an experience. It feels like you've just come in from the horse barn after spreading fresh hay in hot weather. It feels like you're walking up a mountain trail just after snow melt in the spring. It feels like fall right before the leaves drop and you're cutting spruce with a chainsaw. It does NOT smell like something your girlfriend or wife will want to borrow. As for performance, It's moderate. I get about 5-6 hours. But projection and sillage drop pretty fast after about an hour. That's fine for me. I don't need beast mode and it makes Equus more wearable. I can always replenish if I want. Quality is super high. There is nothing cheap or synthetic smelling here. At the price you can get this at discounters this is another steal from Lalique."", ""A very daring fragrance.  For me I get smoke, the dry down of a cedar note and a dry animalisitic note. This fragrance reminds me of a dry, maybe abandoned, ranch that used to have horses or cattle.

Not for me , but the quality is good, like usually for lalique."", 'I\'m going to be one of the many haters of this fragrance, but unfortunately I really dislike it. It reminds me of only ONE thing - HAMSTER CAGE BEDDING! Cedar chips plus urine. I always had hamsters growing up and I just can\'t get past how similar this smells!  However, I will say that I can see why everyone else loves this scent. It smells extremely natural. ""Equus"" is a very fitting name. This is something reminiscent to a horse stall, like Gucci Guilty Absolute, but it goes in a different direction that I personally can\'t appreciate. I wanted to like it too because the sequoia note used is one of my FAVORITE notes! But unfortunately I can\'t appreciate this one at all.  Layers well with Gucci Guilty Absolute, though...  *scratching my chin* ¯|_(ツ)_/¯', ""I have the EDP. I detected moderate to heavy pepper upon initial sprays that reminded me of Lalique White, though I don't recall pepper being a note listed for Equus. The pepper remains through dry down to skin scent with citrus as a minor player. Like many others, I also sense the hay and cedar upon dry down and skin scent mode. A faint whisper of violet upon deep inhalation. Minimal sillage and projection on my skin. I would absolutely not worry about over spraying this and in all seriousness, that may be required for even minimal projection. Unfortunately, this will be located near the back of my collection due to the overly strong pepper I sense."", ""I have been waiting to try this one, since a lot of people suggested me to try this one when I was looking for a cedar-dominant fragrance (I know this one is sequoia based, but many say it is similar). Well, in my case, I get mostly juniper (which I have found I really dislike, too astringent to my nose) with some spices, I get cinnamon, which reminds me of Spicebomb (could be the nutmeg). Once it dries down, you're left with sweet spices and some woodyness in the background. I get about 4 hours with soft projection, which is fine, since Equus is quite cheap. In the end, this is not for me, smells a bit mature for me and quite cheap.

Perfect, mellow fougere, bright bergamot in the opening  What sets this apart is the herbal aspect, and to me it's almost a smooth blend of thyme, bay leaves, maybe cardamom or something? This works so well with coumarin, and the mossy, classic structure of a fougere.  This fragrance is very similar to Invasion Barbare which has this similar herbal note/accord turned up to 11, this is slightly toned down from base to top, but essentially the same and this was the main reason I hadn't bought it because I wanted the MDCI but reality is... it's a little pricey and such but you could definitely own both and find distinctions between them for all their likeness.

Before 2015 its more masculine, its more smells like Invasion Barbare parfum . It was smelled like modern and high quality berber shop fragrance. But after 2015 , in my opinion, formula has changed, more powdery, more amber, more vanilla . Because of this reason , this parfum chracters also changed. Now it s more unisex. It would bee better adding musk and pachuli or guiac wood notes instead of almond and amber. I think the almond is the effect badly parfum balance . You can see this changing , when you read reviews, also parfums rewievs has been changing . Why Histories DP brand did this formula changing.', ""It's a nice unisex scent but it disappears after one hour. Not worth the price."", 'Very sweet and powdery.

It smells nice but has unacceptable longevity and projection which in my experience is par for the course with this house. This is a fantastic introduction to fragrances. Pleasant, light, plays well with others. I usually describe fragrances like this as eminently forgettable. For performance this definitely falls into this category. But the smell. There is a soft powdery muskiness and a hint of citrus to this that brings a level of complexity that I am pleasantly surprised by.', '1725, a fragrance so effortlessly androgynous it transcends the archaic confines of “male” and “female.” Histoires de Parfums crafted this scent as a liberating olfactory experience for those who reject the binary altogether. Lavender and vanilla mingle unapologetically, representing the fluid spectrum of identity, while the almond and amber base notes ground this fragrance in a beautiful state of inclusivity. It’s not “unisex”—a word that reeks of gendered compromise—but rather a bold, nonbinary expression of individuality. Wearing 1725 feels like a subtle act of resistance against outdated norms. It’s a scent for everyone and no one, a wearable protest against the rigid labels some cling to like relics of a less enlightened time. Spritz it on when you’re feeling femme, masc, both, or neither—it will embrace your vibe, no matter where you land on the infinite gender kaleidoscope.', 'My first experience with the House... perfume with a simple construction around Lavender/Licorice/Vanilla, without excitement and moderate performance.', '살짝 매콤하면서 살짝 달달하면서 살짝 파우더리하면서 무난무난한 향수네요', 'Very creamy, gentle lavender. I smell the anise as well but its very gentle and in the background. Reminds me of Initio Rehab but less milky (while still being a very smooth scent).

I rarely wear this out unless I’m going to some type of church service but at home it’s nearly perfect powder notes vanilla and a dry almond. Very nicely done and it also makes a great bed scent. My last outing with this one was for a christening and it worked perfectly', ""The sob story: 1725 was originally marketed for men, however, some homme frags are easily unisex, so had to try. For me unisex perfumes seem to be the way to go in 2023/2024, as I cannot identify with the sugarbombs that are marketed towards women these days. They are getting worse and worse every year: more basic, and sweeter. Spices and woody nuances are mostly absent in women's perfumes. What is more, am yet to find a lasting and femme lavender vanilla. Well lavender is a mostly found in men's stuff. My experience with 1725: 1725 opens deliciously, a mix of spice and citruses, slight ambery glow (unisex here). In the mid-phase I had a bit of a struggle with perception of soap, wood lacquer and powder. I'd say it's quite masculine (liqorice, is that you?). The drydown is more unisex again, more blended but still a bit soapy. 6 hours later, it is a very nice vanilla lavender scent. Probably not buying, the middle couple of hours are a bit challenging, but superenjoyed the intro and the final whispers. In any case, not regretting getting a sample :) Try before you buy :)"", 'Initial impressions so far....fresh powder with vanillic sweetness...not too stuffy...you get some lavender in there too...a nuttiness as well...but to me, the drydown is mainly fresh, airy powder and vanillic, nutty sweetness.  I\'m not sure I would call this a fougere...BUT some below mentioned terms like ""dandified"" or ""powdery dandy fougere"" and mentioned comparisons like Mouchoir de Monsieur or Chanel Boy...I\'ve never smelled the former but do slightly remember testing the latter in store...and yes, it reminds me of Chanel Boy in terms of being in the same category. So I guess this is my first real in-depth exposure to the ""powdery dandy fougere"" category...and I must say, it\'s not too bad. It doesn\'t have a dated smell at all like what is normally associated with fougeres. But for those looking for that strong oakmoss, bitter green, spiciness, etc...you won\'t get that here. Anyway, I need to spend more time with the sample I got...but this is a definite like and may even consider a full bottle.', ""baby powder and vanilla. that's it. 10/10 edit: that's not it. The oakmoss skin scent at the end is very pleasant"", 'Sugar cookie lavender fougere  1725 is a very delightful fragrance yet one that is overly advertised as a barbershop fragrance. It is indeed a fougere along the lines of the powdery dandy fougeres like Chanel Boy or the progenitor of the genderfusion fougere which is Monchoir de Monsieur. As much as the anti-woke airheads below might dislike it, the concept of genderfluidity exists in perfumery since the early 1900s, Caron pour un Homme blends the dry masculine lavender with its delicate feminine vanilla musk base. Guerlain Monchoir de Monsieur blends the feminine Jicky into a more masculine fougere structure. 1725 opens up with a fresh slightly Marseille soap like lavender opening with heaps of nutty coumarin/tonka following it. About 15 minutes in and all the way through the day a powdered sugar cookie dry down sits on my wrist, slightly nutty from the coumarin but predominantly powdery and vanillic.  Anyone can wear it. On me it feels like wearing an intentionally undersized watch, it’s delicate nature highlighting the inherent masculinity of my skin. Similar to AdP Mandorla, for less vanilla and more cleanliness (and overall quality) Chanel Boy comes to mind. Anyone more daring might enjoy the abstract Nicolai New York Intense, which is however a rather large departure.', ""Spicy soapy opening with anise and licorice  Lavender and citrus hints peeking through  Drydown is compeltely woody with creamy sandalwood, amber notes tied together with sweet vanilla There are still remainders of licorice and anise but the lavender and citrus completely disappear It's a lovely scent that I ofter wear before I go to sleep"", 'Definitely androgynous.... Beautiful...', ""I'm already starting to miss the time when the comments here only talked about perfumes, without all the woke bs. there is a very nice word UNISEX which means that the product can be suitable for both men and women, not gender free, not androgynous, not nonbinary, simply UNISEX. people, don't bring your woke infection to this page, no one cares how you feel today, male or female, no one cares how many made up nice sounding words you know, this page is for fragrance enthusiasts and everything related to fragrances, so keep it that way, ok ? :) the smell is wonderful. very mild, as soon as I bought the bottle and smelled the scent, I thought it smelled like a prelude to sex, I don't know why, but after wearing this scent for about a week, I understand that the temptation here is very subtle, airy, this scent doesn't scream, it calmly invites you to come closer, this juice, body heat and light sweat creates something magical that cannot be resisted. if I were a woman and my date would smell like this, I would really only think about making love, really... :D I don't understand how such a correlation between the smell and the name of the perfume is possible :D this smell really doesn't leave any gaps, the women around you will know it clearly why did you came here ;)"", ""I'm amazed that 1725 targeted men since it's perfectly androgynous. The initial burst of citrus, most of which comes from bergamot thins out as soon as licorice and anis sink their spicy tentacles into it and then comes in a powdery lavender (almond plays along well) without suffocating you or clinging to your nostrils, vanilla boosts the totality of the scent but it never blabs and is quite in harmony with others. Now I don't want to lavish 1725 with undeserved praise but to me it's one of the best powdery spicy lavenders around."", 'A lovely playful sweet lavender supported by licorice and a light citrusy vanilla, with some sweet nutty nuance from the almond.

First word that come to mind that.. this is devil in disguise.. 😆 I means.. Think of it, pretending to be polite clean but aromatic note but it is such sweet and alluring. Somewhat reminds me of putain des place (etat) but this is fougere construction. Yeap! I declutter Pegasus after I got this.  This is french perfumery, neat in note, clean in rendition (Feel of White Powdery Wood, Muscone in base) but with that sexy twist. I means we talk about casanova tho. I like it so much.. (Ps. Almond in this provide no nuttiness we don’t talk about bitter almond or heliotrope - almond note when show up in this leans powdery fluffy.) …. I wish for higher quality of something like this.

This fragrance reminds me something, but I can't remember what. Tbh I really regret spending ~$2/2.5 on this sampler. Smells soft spicy, with some larander and vanilla, can't smell any almonds or almond milk. If you want something spicy, reather buy something like Bvlgari Man in Black. Oh i realised what this fragrance reminds me, something like dior homme intense but with spicy notes, or dry down of gentlemen reserve privee but with vanilla, anyway i don't really like it as well like that two fragrances. I don't wear it yet, so can't say anything about performance or does it brings compliments or not. Conclusion: Designer quality in niche, what means overpriced if we compare price and quality."", '1725 is a soft, powdery, and dandy fragrance. Even though it has a touch of sweetness, there is nothing cloying about it. This fragrance is best for transitional seasons during the day.', 'I wish I could make this last longer. What a gorgeous and sophisticated scent. Almost as soapy as I can stand (that place belongs to Xinu Monstera). I would wear in the spring any time, and on cool summer nights.', 'The word “powdery” is thrown around in the fragrance community a lot. Half the time the fragrance feels and smells NOTHING like any sort of powder.  This, by all means, is powdery. More than anything else I have ever come across.  It is a sweet powdery lavender and sandalwood. Not uber syrupy sweet but more “old school” sweet if that makes sense.  The licorice and anisic qualities are far in the background but still serve to give this a slight masculine edge. They are sort of like a good bass drum in music - they are felt more than they are heard. Almond is listed as a note, but it isn’t the artifical almond sweetener kind you find in Hypnotic Poison or PDM Pegasus. Rather, it is a very subtle impression of “nuttiness” to my nose. Again, felt and not heard. I do not get one single iota of citrus but it is still refreshing. It has a (just slightly manly) sweet baby powder vibe to me. Awesome for a day in spring. Overall, I like this. You can pull it off if you are confident and well dressed. Exudes a unique kind of clean. 8.0/10', ""This is undoubtedly one of the best perfumes I own, and I have hundreds. I bought it many years ago and have used it in any situation and during any season. Despite being very subtle and ethereal, it has a strong presence and a defined personality hidden behind an initial impression of a warm, clean, and safe fragrance. It's not a perfume that screams, but you feel it, and it faithfully accompanies you during both summer and winter. I recently finished the bottle, but I'm about to buy another one. I believe that 1725 easily ranks in my top 3 alongside Carnal Flower and Ambre Precieux. I don't know why many associate 1725 with the scent of baby wipes. I dare to hypothesize that it depends largely on the undeniable differences in taste among citizens of the continents of the world. As an Italian, I consider this perfume a masterpiece that speaks softly, a small pearl in a sea of unnecessary noise. Americans, don't hate me: it's like when I choose a restaurant on TripAdvisor and select the option for reviews in my language. Europeans, step forward."", '""Cookie Fougère"" of Licorice, Marzipan & Lavender... This is so good. It\'s quite sweet, and the almond-vanilla has a paste texture that evokes marzipan. I agree with reviewer alphairone below who describes it as ""An anisette cookie fougere, sprinkled lightly with powdered sugar and resting on a hassock of lavender...this barbershop is adjacent to an Italian bakery."" 1725 was composed as a tribute to Casanova, and I could imagine the late Heath Ledger wearing this while filming Casanova (film 2005). The discovery set insert reads: ""Giacomo Girolamo Casanova: a man whose name has come to symbolize seduction. For every Casanova, here is an eau de parfum inviting intense pleasure with amber fern, find woody accords and touches of sparkling Italian bergamot. ""  I get some reminders of Le Male Jean Paul Gaultier & Hypnotic Poison Dior. and for an oversimplified comparison this could be a masculine version of Hypnotic Poison, or in a family of sweet almond-anise scents including Loverdose Diesel, Lolita Lempicka Lolita Lempicka and Hypnotic Poison Dior. It makes sense, since Hypnotic Poison is considered a femme fatale scent, while Casanova is reputed for his notorious amorous adventures. It\'s a love for me. 10/10. Enjoy!', 'I smell lavender way more than licorice or star anise.', 'It smells like baby powder or baby wipes. Not that close to Invasion Barbare either. Feels too precious and soft. Disappointing.', 'On paper - smells like Chanel\'s Boy, minus the fizzy citruses on top. A very clear, crisp lavender, unisex-to-masc fougere. On skin - lavender and anise much more prominent on my skin, but in a very powdery, clean, barely soapy way. Nice! Very put-together and I actually like this a lot more than Chanel\'s Boy.  Scent: 7.5/10 - refreshing and clean, yet unique Perfectly unisex IMO, while there\'s that powdery aspect, I don\'t think it leans ""round"" or ""creamy"" enough to be considered feminine.', ""This is not a fougere, it's mostly lavendery powder and white smelling makeup, with glimpses of light pastel colors. A very nice and pleasant scent, gentle and velvety, projection is appropriate and longevity is great. It's similar to Prada Black and equally good. After all, it seems you don't need to be a macho powerhouse to charm women, at contrary! :D See Rorshach1004's review, it's the best! :) 9/10"", 'This to me smells super similar to Armani Code Colonia which i already have and it has a nice scent profile (nothing mind blowing). Unisex, not leaning to any direction in particular.', 'Spiced lavender and vanilla. Clean scent, something like a laundry pod. Unisex but a little too musky or dense to lean femme, although it’s otherwise a feminine leaning scent if that makes sense. In other words, the balance is off-kilter. Somewhere between a 😐 and a 🙂. Personal preference suggests this is a pass. Not because it’s uninteresting, but because it’s not practically enjoyable.', 'The opening is fresh, soft and warm almond lavender talcum powder smell. Like a man that just left the barbershop & walked into the bakery next door & there’s fresh croissants nearby. Absolutely no citrus in the fragrance. I begin to pick up on a couple of unpleasant notes mixing, Amber, sandalwood & licorice.. which is just a tad scratchy (sandalwood always does this to me). The almond is noticeable & quite a nice twist. Overall it’s a pleasant wearing. Kinda like a mix of Darley, Prada Black & baby powder. Wish the almond/ vanilla was amped up just a touch. Edit: Sometimes on the dry down a few hours later, I get make-up bag vibes (might be the quality of lavender mix).. like a feminine beauty product, just hints at it. It hurts my head after about 1hr. It’s lacking a deeper note to hold it down as more masculine. begins to tilt to the unisex side ever so slightly. Because of this, I like to layer 1725 with actual fougére fragrances, making them powdery & fluffy.. Or w/ something cocoa 🤤.  1725 has made its way in my top 10 for life. good silage so I suggest 1-2 sprays max', ""Baby powder contoured with lavender and perhaps a hint of anise. Quite a sillage--it's tickling my nose from all the way down on my forearm. If you can get past the tickle, up close next to the skin there's a slight hint of something a little more sweetly earthy. It comes and goes and I wonder if I'm imagining it. The cedar perhaps? The amber? I want a bit more of that, I think. I imagine this perfume would mingle wonderfully with one's own 'odeur personelle'. After all, this is by conception an 18th century scent. Perhaps try applying it after a particularly vigorous romp and see where that gets you."", 'After a couple wearings I can say that this opens up similar to Invasion Barbare and dries down similar to the old Dior Homme. But instead of getting the soft creaminess from Iris, it gets it from vanilla and sandalwood. Either way this is absolutely a Casanova fragrance! For a gentle, put together, confident man or woman.', 'Mrrob sums it upp very well, its my go to sleep scent. Every note is so very nicely done, the blend is superb, and it gives a old school yet modern touch, its like a creamy dreamy powdery wonder. I would not even say its that much off a fougere, its in a Leauge off its own. You can ware it in a suit...in the bath..naked...every place is a place to wear this wonderful gem Talking points are the almond and the lavender in this beauty, anis and licorice note is mostly prominent in the opening were it combines w the grape and makes a sour explosion for about a second, then it calmes down and acts smoooth and friendly  Now its time to sleep...two sprays and my pillow will carry my on soft clouds to the dream land..', '1725 Casanova is often considered a Neo fougere I agree that the powder / lavender aspect does give a nod to fougere frags but I feel this is more of an oriental style fragrance as the licorice vanilla and almond become the focus in the dry down. Although vanilla and almond are here I would not say this is a gourmand This definitely gives off a groomed feel but also smells cozy and relaxing and actually makes for a good bed scent. I personally love wearing this one in neutral to cooler months in the morning it can be worn to work out to breakfast even to church as this does have a slight dandy feel to it. Wears well with gray / blue khakis and a crisp white shirt or even a warm sweater in the fall. Ultimately it gives the feeling of joy and of good moments in life.', ""Testing blind this opened with a slightly spicy air with a musky and barely powdery body. There's a hint of animalistic character but as it dries down it loses this and a good portion of it's spicy character, but not completely and lingers around for a good long while as predominantly a soft but intimate powdery fragrance. To me there's a hint of sweetness but it's not really sweet per se. Definitely gives a nod towards its name. Interesting, but not my dig."", ""I've tried this and now own it. Very much like MDCI Invasion Barbare. Very alluring, warm, spicy, heavy anise which I like and licorice nuanced. If you have one, you don't need the other. It's redundant. Longevity is very respectable and sillage equally so. Since the quality is so high, you'll pay!  A very well made fragrance, excellent quality workmanship."", ""I recently picked up a botlle of 1725 Casanova and I'm sorry that I didn't discover it sooner. I love this stuff...it is a licorice and lavender powder puff. I also get the almond and vanilla, but the sweetness here is very light, just a hint. This doesn't veer into cloying-land. I do find this playful and seductive, but at the same time it is grown-up and swank. I can't really think of a time or place that this wouldn't be appropriate. Wearing this makes me feel dapper and dashing...it puts a little pep in my step. Good stuff."", 'I just got it and here are my thoughts. OPENING: Smells completely different than i thought it would, but not in a bad way, but I definitely don´t get any citruses from the opening at all, except a sweet orange note that kind of reminds me of sunscreen, which i am a fan of, but i would honestly prefer something more fresh, like for example the bergamot note in Armani Code. I also smell lavenders and licorice a lot. DRYDOWN: Dry down is beautiful. The vanilla note comes in play and makes everything smoother. It kind of reminds me of baby wipes. I saw some people compare this to Le Male, Armani Code and Invasion Barbare. I don´t know how IB smells but this does not smell like Le Male or Armani Code. Maybe like 15% resemblance to LM and 10% resemblance to Code. Both code and le male are way more fresh and masculine, this on the other hand is creamy and unisex and just something completely different. PERFORMANCE is not bad, but i would appreciate slightly better performance sillage wise, because even though with perfumes like this (sweet and seductive) you probably don´t want to have 10 feet room filling sillage, it still could be slightly better. FINAL THOUGHTS: I really like this one, but i don´t think i am going to buy another bottle just because it´s just not fresh enough for me. I would also definitely call this unisex. I can easily imagine a woman wearing this, even though it might be slightly more masculine leaning. It could easily be used as a signature scent. Edit: After wearing it multiple times i learned to like it even more than before. I would give it like 6 before, but now, after a month, i rate it 8', ""Goes on totally warm powder with odd woody notes, not really masculine at all, but not sweet enough to be feminine. But sooooo not something I like on a man. Just too much lavender powder. As it dries, though, I am loving it a lot. Soft, clean powder more like a lotion than babies. Full dry down has a tang among the soft woody vanilla lavender. Very nice after all. But still not masculine. It’s only unisex for older men. Reminds me a bit of my a cologne my grandfather wore, which I don't love."", ""I do not really know what to say about this fragrance, I really don’t.

Oh well, I decided to buy it, and test it, and my oh my.

I also Ama again doubly shocked that this was released 22 years ago. I am about to be blasphemous and say, Fredric Malle, Carnal Flower, POAL, Must Ravaguer have all been trumped by this. This sits in the classic, unique and so, oh so delightful pedestal all on its own. I am horrendous at describing or painting pictures of how the different notes and accords dance with one another, and so many others have already described in exquisite and artistic detail.

Then the licorice/anise starts to come in and this reminds me of a more unisex, less sweet version of Lolita Lempicka for women (I haven't tried LL Au Masculin).

Charming, not abrupt. The dry down is what makes it so unique; it's soft, welcoming, sensual. Totally unisex.

It's a true delight."", ""Beautiful contemporary fougere that dabbles in spicy, barbershop, and gourmand territories.

Having read about this several times, my interest was piqued when I found a 15 ml bottle on sale recently. Opening with a fleeting citrus this scent goes very quickly into the heart of dusty lavender and dries down on vanilla, amber and just a hint of leather or maybe liquorice. I don't really get any of the mentioned woods or almonds.  Now, I am usually very fine with lavender, as in the fresh spicy Platinum Egoiste or the oriental La Nuit de l'Homme. None the less something in 1725 just doesn't sit right with me. When I spray it on my skin, it comes off... feminine maybe? Don't get me wrong, I'm all about people wearing what they like instead of being directed by the gender instructions from the manufacturer, but this one makes me feel slightly uncomfortable about myself when wearing it out and about. I have a feeling that the mix of lavender with amber and vanilla is what makes this happen. To be honest, this strikes me much more as a unisex than a male perfume. It's a fougere all right, but don't expect it to be your typical male fougere as it lacks the freshness that most feature. The scent that reminds me the most of this one is Caron's Pour un Homme (or even the powderiness of a less leathery version of Midnight in Paris), even if 1725 seems to be richer and generally of a higher quality. Both projection and longevity are rather moderate as 1725 is pretty subtle, not a loud scent in any way. I haven't read into it but if this scent is supposed to represent Casanova, I'd see him as more of a dandy, tease or a charmer rather than a seducer.  Long story short, after testing it several times over a couple of weeks I caved in and gifted it to my girlfriend - on whom it smells delightful, go figure.

Except for Lavender, i don't see many notes that would make this a fougère. And the lavender is not as prominent as some suggest, it goes under the sweet and powdery notes. This is very sweet and powdery, and if didn't know there was lavender in the heart notes, i would have trouble guessing it. And to the comparison with Invasion Barbare, really? There is some slight resemblance that they both have some sweetness and powder (Invasion Barbare far far less, and that also because of the Violet and not licorice and Almond). Invasion Barbare is a fougère with a modern twist, not too sweet and has some green herbal and spicy notes to it. This one however could as well be a unisex or feminine fragrance with the super thick layer of Vanilla, Anise and Almond. No green, herbal or soapy qualities whatsoever.

Anyhow, 1725 is a powdery, dusty fragrance, with a clean, citrus-like licorice accord in the opening, blended among a vanilla-almond base note combination to provide sweet qualities to the mixture, which it is then dialed back by an anise note in the heart. In the mid notes, the anise is mixed with a lavender smell, in which they create an adult, mature, and casual aura to the fragrance. 1725 does contain some sour liquor-like undertones to the composition before the powdery sections, and I get about 7 hours on my skin with moderate projection. Histoires de Parfums has a reputation of creating quality scents, but at the same time, the end result of their base line products have a lackluster depth to them. In this case, 1725 often feels uninteresting, dull, and bland due to the lack of a star accord to make it worthwhile.

There\'s no freshness in this one, at the opposite, vanilla gives some sweetness. For a moment, I thought I had sprayed 1899...

As for comparisons, Casanova does smell like Invasion Barbare - but really only after 90 minutes or so - when (for me) Invasion Barbare becomes uninteresting. I think many who compare haven't done so side by side. The openings are vastly different - IB evolves a great deal whilst 1725 Casanova doesn't change much from its initially spray Casanova openining is completely different to IB - it is very powdery, it lacks the very prominent cardamom of IB and has a different and harsher citrus note whilst the violet leaf also make the openings of the two fragrances to be quite different. The lavender in Casanova also isn't quite as prominent as it is IB. Casanova does have almond, which in later stages may evoke the base vanilla of Invasion Barbare adding to the similarity we smell later on. So broadly speaking - it's really in the late mid notes to base where the two converge. Invasion Barbare is always a step ahead of though. And if money was no issue - I'd buy IB. IB's first 90 mins are lovely. 1725 Casanova is like a slightly sweet mix of baby powder and shaving foam. But if you like it buy it. But I wouldn't. Invasion Barbare is the far superior scent - although I think that too is overhyped and overpriced (despite the quality).  *note - I haven't worn either yet - only back of hand tests. So I will report back on a comparison between the performance of the two*"", ""A perfumed finch from some mythical pleasure garden. Light, sweet, and effortlessly charming.

Not a classic, and I do wish performance were a bit better, BUT....its gorgeous and masculine, but masculine in an interesting way -- there is nothing carnal about this scent. It is akin to the a very refined but dignified (not at all elderly mind you) statesman from Italy or Belgium. And there is something of a quality of antiquity about it, too. A quality of romance and memory. I love when scents can do that. And this does. Its the way the sandalwood and almond rise to the surface at the same moment it seems. The opening is a bit confused but after a few minutes when that almond and sandalwood...and with some of the citrus there...appear, and guid the remaining the evolution here. If i had a complaint it is that following that the vanilla becomes a bit too pronounced. Now, that said, the longevity isnt great. Its ok, but not great. And at these prices it should be better. Projection is low...but its that kind of scent. Up close its just intoxicating. Its like someone reading dante in the original in a tower in Florence. The dry down is elegant, powdery with a clear licorice note. Yes, its a bit of a barbershop scent...but the very most high quality barber in Milan, perhaps. But finally, its not quite a profound scent. Few are. It is however far better than some of the things its been compared to on this thread.

So, what does this mean for the scent? To be honest this is a powdery scent with hints of citrus, almond, and licorice with a bit of lavender and star anise. The opening of this scent is not my favorite, Its is a really powdery opening, think Casanova's powdered wig. The opening, after holding on for olfactory patience, gives way to a fantastic mid. The amber and sandalwood give this scent some muscle, and then we get the licorice and lavender with some hints of almond, lingering citrus, star anise and vanilla. HdP 1725 then shifts from powdery to slightly creamy and a bit gourmandish, which in my opinion saves this scent and renders it really enjoyable and wearable. I think I read into the hype a bit too much with this one. A lot of people say it has a barbershop vibe, which I think is due in part to people reading lavender in the notes. Its is not a barbershop scent per se, but I feel 1725 is a gentleman's scent. Now, this scent is tricky to find an occasion to wear it. Yes, I can get all cliche and say; wear 1725 with a nice suit and tie. But no. I think 1725 is what you wear when like Casanova often did; plot. Yes, have you crossed paths with the love of your life and do not have the courage or the right plan to break the ice?

Here is my take. Casanova 1725 - It almost has the same lavender barber shop scent that Invasion offers but without the harsh blast of lavender that invasion has. This scent is mellow and soft. I get a creamy almond vanilla scent from this. It almost has a powdery smell to it but not in a feminine way. Casanova is an excellent name for this fragrance. You're left wanting more from this scent which is what Casanova was all about. Its like you're drawn to it but if you get to close and figure it out you'll be left dissatisfied. Best advise I can give the wearer of this scent is don't wear it for you, but wear it for the people around you. This becomes a close skin scent after about 4 hours and if you haven't been able to get the girl close enough to you within those 4 hours of 1st application you'll lose her. Casanova was patient but didn't spend too much in one place remember that when wearing this.  *Longevity - Good not great 6-8  *Projection - Good but soft *Year round scent easily worn in the warmer months unlike Invasion Barbare Invasion Barbare - At first sniff I thought it was a little too harsh of a scent. I get a serious blast of lavender. If I was to describe how heavy it starts off - think of Sandalwood by Art of Shaving and mixing in lavender. Its softens with a bit of vanilla but the heavy lavender lingers. Ideally when you walk by a person the draft you will create should make the person smelling you, think...sweet but masculine and distinguished (just left the barbershop) Its like clashing heavy and soft together. Invasion is a great name for this scent because people will feel invaded by you when walking by but very happy that you did. I think this fragrance smells better to the people smelling you than it does to the person wearing it. The lavender blast is a bit too much. Maybe with the right atomizer it will air it out and soften it more. *Longevity - Great!! All day  *Projection - excellent, it will concur and invade *Fall/Winter wearer this at in the colder months, too heavy for the summer"", 'For once I agree with reviewers detection of notes here on Fragrantica.

Sometimes I find the anis/licorice a little too sharp. But when the balance is tilted the other way, I love this fragrance. Pretty linear, the lavender/vanilla is blended, not serial as in Caron puh or Taste of heaven. Unisex they say, but come on. Casanova was amongst the greatest seducers of the charming kind.

If you thought Dior Homme was too feminine, or thought Invasion Barbare was too classic, or, you're just looking for the best of both worlds - I think this is something you'll really enjoy. As far as quality of ingredients go, yes, Invasion Barbare is absolutely best in class. However, I get greater joy wearing 1725. It suits me better as a man in his late 20's.

Masculine and appropriate for any occassion or situation. I would consider it a fall and winter scent because of it sweetness. Honestly I can't see anyone disliking this fragrance but it can be cloying if you wear too much ..A little goes a long way and there is no need to reapply during the day. Over all a well crafted fragrance"", ""Casanova indeed! Dirty lavender, citrus, warm vanilla and a touch of amber.  I know iris is not listed, but i feel like there is a touch of iris in here.  This is what a modern gentleman would wear. It really evokes that sort of feel to it.  I don't understand the connection to Invasion barbare. I think they're completely different.  Slightly disappointed in the projection and silage. It was below average for me. Excellent longevity."", ""Definitely not Invasion Barbare based on a first wearing from a sample bottle direct from PdH. Similar middle character but is much toned down, whereas the top is harsher. Dries down quickly, as noted by a previous review. A very pleasant fougere. Powdery, but well-blended. I wish I had never tried Invasion Barbare, because if I didn't know there was an even better fougere out there, I would have no problem paying the full $125 for a 60mL bottle of 1725. Superb scent I would fully recommend to anyone not willing to pay double for IB. 8/10."", ""I bought yesterday at 75% reduction, wooh, wooh. Put on this morning and had a blast of recognition that I couldn't at first name.... Blew me away when I realized it was all-time fave Invasion Barbare. The nicest possible surprise it is possible to conceive. But it also smells very much like Pour Un Homme, another wonderful smell. And, wonderfully, smells like itself, 1725. One of those great scents that are so very RIGHT in so many ways that you could wear forever. I definitely prefer IB, which is peerless, but who cares?  I paid $51 for 120ml of 1725 while IB is $250 for 60ml. Maybe I've let that cloud my judgement. I doubt it though."", 'nice stuff, I can see why they call it Casanova , to me sort of like the appeal of Antico Caruso.. or along those lines is my first impression. 1725,  very smooth light fragrance that is deceptively masculine. A sweet, alluring gentlemanly fragrance. I can see what appeal from the opposite sex on wearing 1725 The ladies will not see you coming lol,. they never had a chance. Casanova or 1725, which ever suits your fancy but this fragrance will speak for your amorous intentions..other scents announce it loudly , this one is subtle, maybe sneaky is a better word, They will want you to stay awhile..I like it. romance is in the air. Thumbs way up.', 'Chivalry in a bottle. Powdery, sweet, and elegant. Similar to Invasion Barbare? Yes. But not the same. This is a romantic scent best reserved for dates and special occasions. This is what a well groomed gentleman should smell like.', '1725 has an understated beginning that is warm, spicy and sweet, but is nothing particularly spectacular. You think, that was nice, but I don’t see what all the fuss is about. Hang around though, as things get more interesting as the scent develops. After the dry-down it morphs gently into a powdery lavender, with a soapy spice that is really quite pleasant. Again, nothing spectacular, but then it starts to grow on you, and something strange happens. Like the famous lover who is the inspiration behind the scent it has an alluring magnetism that creeps up on you, and before you know where you are you have done something utterly unexpected and fallen in love. Was this deliberate? Perhaps 1725 really is the essence of romantic love in a bottle? You try not to be impressed, but what can you do? You are in love, reality dissipates and you are taken away to a very silly, ephemeral and purposefully deluded place, but there’s nowhere else that you would rather be.', ""Soft Seducer (Sylvie Jourdet, 2001) Bottle Design: Olivia Grandperrin Scentrack: Art of Noise – Love Beat Casanova opens up with the beautiful and brisk grapefruit, accompanied by the anise, and clean, soft and full bodied lavender. Everything is so innocent, fluffy, white and airy. Like a chilly morning in a lavender plantation. White almonds give almost some Amaretto accord. It has the softest and the most expensive barbershop vibe I have ever encountered. Soft, creamy and visually pale. Maybe it's too easy to say for fragrance is beautiful, but it perfectly describes 1725. Absolutely stunning to me. Perfectly balanced and tweaked fragrance. Casanova’s calming sensuality is so alluring. To its drydown Casanova becomes a little bit darker with just a touch of warm amber, creamy vanilla and sandalwood. A semi gourmand unisex barbershop perfection. One of the best, if not the best barbershop fragrance. A true beauty in the classic form, like an Andrea Palladio’s project in a new millennium form. Old charmer in a new era, a seduction at the first sniff. Highly recommended.  Rating: 10/10"", ""Surprising, that's an apt definition - if totally useless. I think I just wasn't prepared for this fragrance. It's a mix between a barbershop lavender cologne, a powdery boudoir fragrance, and a cup of almonds and licorice bonbons. In a way I love it. Yet, it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. A fascinating surprise!"", ""I'd say women can wear 1725 too."", ""You're seven years old. You're in a barber shop, and even though you have no hairs on your face, an old man lathers you up for a shave, and you all laugh as your white foam beard is scraped away.

You've accidentally discovered your mom's makeup products, and you're curious (but repelled) as you smell her foundation powder and those foam puffs she would use to dab it on her face. 1725 by Histoires de Parfums."", '1725 is sharp, masculine, clean and classy. A versatile scent that has become my signature. I can see the similarities between Invasion, but in my opinion they are completely different.  Invasion is little sweeter and more powdery, dry? Its also a bit of a cardamon bomb and can become cloying rather quickly, whereas 1725 is brighter, smoother and does not beg for attention.  Those looking for 10 feet projection and SILLLLAAGGEE grab Invasion. Not saying 1725 does not perform, because it does, but its not all in your face. Overall, both are quality scents. Anyone saying Invasion is superior is basing the review solely on the price tag.', 'Too much lavender and too much powder, evokes an image of a barbershop, a ""big no"" for me...', 'Nice unisex lavender/anice office-safe fragrance... A little bit too safe imo. The blend of lavender/vanilla/almond/anice nearly emulates cinnamon. It\'s a warm frag for Fall days.  That said, while it\'s definitely aromatic, I don\'t see it at all as a fougere... lavender alone is not enough to tell it\'s a fougere. There\'s no freshness in this one, at the opposite, vanilla gives some sweetness. For a moment, I thought I had sprayed 1899... But at this pricepoint, ""nice"" is not enough, and there are no excuses for bad projection. They have to realize at some point that they are competing with houses like Amouage, Tiziana Terenzi and Le Labo, Etat Libre d\'Orange in that price range, that, except for a few exceptions, are playing in a higher league (in terms of scent originality). What saves HdP is their ""alternative"" bottle size offerings, and thus effective pricing (0.5, 2 and 4oz, instead of the more common 1.7 and 3.4oz). All of HdP fragrances are pleasant, but lack audacity (except for ""1740"" and ""Noir Patchouli"" in which there is maybe a little too much). I\'m not a marketing expert, but unless they decide to target exclusively 50+ crowds, they are on the wrong path. That said, the 0.5oz offering around $35 make me think they don\'t want that...  I want to like you guys, but it\'s not easy here... HdP!!! Wake uuuuppppp! Give me something more funky!!', 'What could one possibly criticize about this scent? It smells very nice and has good longevity and some sillage... I guess in my case it simply leaves me cold as if it were one among so many other ""OK"" perfumes I can sample at any perfume shop.  I had my own expectations in general and in particular after sampling the enthralling Marquis de Sade, which is very hard to take (I even got angry at the perfumer one night I found it, simply put, faecal) BUT you can say there is a link between the name and the scent... some sort of search in that one. Here, the opposite. A nice scent that smells like many other and one that never ever I\'d relate to any interesting guy such as Casanova or any other. I won\'t be harsh since the name of perfumes hardly mean anything to me anyways... but in this case the brand caught my attention for its quality and its sort of ""game"" of evocation and unique mixes... well... here I don\'t see that. Or, to be honest, it is not what I imagined it to smell like... this is too Marie-Antoinette... powdery, girly in a commonplace way, nothing short of talcum, clean in just-showered-babies kind ... and perhaps it does evoke palaces and secretive women of that time... but I expected this to be sexy as hell, not bitchy. Masculine, not obviously old grand ma. I mean, no problem with those perfumes... I like them! What I intend to say is: there are many more interesting ways to make a men\'s scent androgynous if that\'s the intention. Many more original and less ""safe"" ways to face these challenges, something I expect from niche and particularly from this brand. Now back to the scent... it smells nice! I wouldn\'t wear it nor buy it though. Creamy vanilla plus a touch of lavender... I\'ve worn better renditions at a quarter of the price. I guess Le Male beats this by far and is indeed ohhhh so carnal! My personal Casanova smell!']"

This is unconscionably overpriced, 50 ml retailing for almost $1,000 converted here in Mexico to smell like a $1 bar of soap with spices is outrageously bad. Even for discounter prices this is still very overpriced for what it is.

Now add to consideration the price, and I struggle to see a rational justification for buying it.

A bit too floral for me (although that's only a personal preference), but also lacks the character of the others, and projection and longevity are average."", 'I ended up blind buying this fragrance and to be honest I didn’t know what to expect but I knew i would either love it or hate it based off of the polarized reviews I read across various review sites and YouTube. There were people claiming it smells grandmotherly and feminine, while others claiming it smelt luxurious and rich.  My bottle arrived yesterday and as always the presentation with Clive Christian is nothing but class, rich elitism. And I’m all for it. The bottle is beautiful and the atomizer and weight is everything you want.  Upon first spray I was immediately captivated. It’s blended to perfection and incredibly smooth. It opens with a pop of nutmeg, wood, spice, all which is held together by the powdery quality which stays throughout its lifespan. As it opens up in to the mid notes the florals enter the scene and it vacillates between yellow and white floral aromatics, with nutmeg and a cinnamon quality slightly present in the background which makes it alluring and devine. You can detect sandalwood as-well but it’s not in-your-face woods. But rather It’s creamy, and super smooth — I guess 50 year old sandalwood really does make a difference!  It is powdery and the florals are present, but what many hate-reviewers leave out of their review is the part about the background spice which makes this fragrance so engaging. It’s not just powder powder powder.. it’s in this order to my nose: Powdery spices, smooth wood, slight spices, floral, spices. All together at once. So if a person is expecting low amounts of powder or florals and just some wood, yea you won’t get that.  This concoction is incredibly classy. Black tie event. Important get together. Wedding fragrance. Anniversary dinner. It’s simply just pure class, as the bottle suggests. It was an instant love for me and I know I’ll just grow to love it more because of its complexity.  Where the grandmother is concerned.. I think people just associate floral with female. And class with old person, in this overly sugar sweet or blue fragrance designer saturated market.  Before buying, while I was reading reviews I was concerned about it being too fem or granny. But be rest assured it is not. It’s powdery and smooth, just very refined. You’ll see.. This is a fragrance for men. Not guys or boys. Men.  The performance is amazing. Solid sillage and longevity is 24+ hours. So no concerns there.  This just edged out my Royal Oud for the number 1 spot of what to wear at black tie events… And for a darker take on it, I imagine spritzing ‘X For Men’ by CC overtop would make this classy beast a bit brooding. I will give that a shot when my bottle arrives! (Generally I’m not a fan of layering since I think it muddles fragrances too much but I will report back) 10/10 — pure class act', 'Absolute love at first sniff.  Damn it, why do I always really like the expensive ones?  No. 1 has a combination of some of my favorite notes in perfumery resulting in a unique, powdery, creamy, woody, floral, clean soapy musk. It is a wonderful example of a powdery accord done well, a slight nod to perfumes from the past, buttery iris, heliotrope for an almost almondy/nutty effect, and creamy, soapy sandalwood. Can’t stop sniffing myself. Just like Roja Dove’s Roja Haute Luxe, this literally made my eyes physically roll into the back of my head the moment I first sprayed it onto my skin. Hedonistic, kaleidoscopic. Much more complex than it appears upon first encounter, incredibly well blended.  I opened a door to go outside about an hour after that first spray and the air rushing out and around me brought the fragrance up to my nose in whiffs of pure anosmic ecstasy, slightly different than what i experience when i put my nose straight up to my skin, so I know this must smell lovely to others in the air. And if not, that’s okay, because I absolutely am infatuated with this stuff, and I wouldn’t care if it makes others happy or not, because it makes me happy.  50ml for $700 is quite expensive, but you can grab 10ml in the $300 traveler set, which comes out to $100 for 10ml. That’s a little better value per ml if you want a small bottle, which is funny because usually with most houses and designers you usually pay more per ml for their smaller bottles. If you think this smells feminine due to the florals, or “grandmotherly” due to the powder, I don’t know what else to tell you. To me, it’s incredibly smooth, modern, clean, fresh, airy, creamy, rich, and woody, and sweet but not that typical cotton candy sweetness. It doesn’t even slightly resemble the type of perfumes (chypres, animalics, rose heavy florals) that usually get that association from younger or naive noses.

Take it as a fact – review the scent, not its price. We all know how much it costs. Yes, it is outrageous. But after all this is not made for people who care about the price anyway, so it’s completely irrelevant.  Now to the scent itself. To me this feels like having a bath full of fresh flowers and expensive essential oils made for you by your servants in your family chateau built in 18th century. You can smell powdery cleanness, citruses and aged sandalwood. Beautiful composition.  How powerful is it? When I first tested it I sprayed just a little on my wrist, not even a full spray and it easily filled the room, then it lasted for like 5 hours and even survived hot shower. 2 sprays is all I need for the whole day. So if you are one of those people who absolutely don’t care about money and enjoy feeling like someone who owns a castle (or you actually own one), get it – you will be thrilled.', 'Although Im a fan of Clive Christian, this is not so good. The floral is not masculine, and also not even a good smelling feminine. It’s like baby powder used to cover up pee when it comes, and it’s been coming for years now.  I keep sniffing it trying to change perspective and it just keeps delivering on the baby powder and pee essence (no, not straight urine, just kinda baked in).', ""To start I'll state the obvious: this is not worth the asking price. But that doesn't mean it's a bad perfume. It's quite a stunning and beautiful fragrance. Clive Christian No. 1 is a lot more than simply a powdery floral; there's a lot more going on here. I get touches of citrus which give it a balanced, airy tartness. I get ambery, musky warmth that gently radiates off the skin. I get very subtle spice and herbal notes in the blend. And the coup de gras - the 50 year old aged sandalwood is simply to die for. It is cozy, warm, radiant and rich.  If all you're used to is department store men's cologne, or you are relatively new to the fragrance world, No. 1 may be perceived as feminine leaning. But to my nose this really does smell like a rich men's perfume. I picture getting dressed up to go to the symphony or wearing this to a wedding. High class juice.  No. 1 uses very high-quality natural ingredients. It smells regal, dense and expensive. It is almost unbelievably well blended. On my wearings, No. 1 sits very close to the skin giving you a golden aura to those standing near you, and it is strong enough to leave a nice scent trail. That being said, the projection is very minimal, and longevity leaves a bit to be desired. (You can detect it on your skin almost all day, but it becomes a skin scent within 3-4 hours on me.) In summary, No.1 has some very strong positives and some minor negatives. Obviously do not pay retail for this ($790 for 50ml as of the time of this review). I was able to find a 50ml bottle for about $200, and to me, this is worth every penny of that."", 'Opening I get powder and a tiny bit of cola, ever so slightly medicinal. After a few hours it’s very floral. It certainly smells quality, just not for me. This one gets a «\xa0meh\xa0»', ""Wore this on a walk to the grocery store today. It smells pleasant in a soft breeze. At almost $800 retail, the assumption ought to be that it will smell pleasant, at the very least, right? However, it doesn't smell that pleasant, especially given what it purports to be: the masculine magnum opus of a high-dollar luxury perfume brand. First, I would never purchase a full bottle of this fragrance, without even taking its price into account. Second, taking its price into account, this fragrance is absolutely laughable. There is nothing about the smell of this fragrance that warrants its price tag. If you are going to make an extremely expensive halo fragrance (literally titled No. 1), it needs to be an absolute home run; this fragrance is barely a bunt. Finally, while I was in the store, I felt so self-conscious and avoided walking near anyone out of fear they might smell me and wonder why a young man is walking around wearing a grandmother's perfume. It's powdery and floral, with sandalwood and vanilla base notes. Think a Chanel No. 5-type fragrance, but slightly more modern and sweeter. I can't imagine a world in which anyone finds this fragrance to be remotely masculine; and for this, once again, to be your masculine MAGNUM OPUS... what was this brand thinking? Bottom line, sample this to say that you have, but not because you might otherwise miss out on a great fragrance. You won't. This is not that."", ""Obtained a 2ml vial of this perfume just to test what's the hype is all about. First impression of the smell: Luxurious. You know it's not one of those cheap perfumes; this belongs to the high society, easily upper class stuff. The potency & richness of the juice can be felt immediately. They don't skimp on the ingredients. Nothing synthetic or 'pharmacy perfume' vibe at all. Chanel-like quality. Secondly, although it's written on the bottle as 'oriental woody', it has a very floral scent. A good mixture of different type of flowers, but I can't pinpoint to any dominating note. I can imagine an elegant elderly woman, either an aristocrat or CEO wearing this on a formal ocassion. Young girls won't wear this; it's too 'mature', 'serious' and 'heavy' for them to carry it. No way this is a nightclub material, especially with that mild powdery drydown. Thirdly, yes you read it right, I mentioned about females. I find it amusing that this is categorised as a perfume for men. Put it on a blind test, I bet 90% of men would think this is a legit feminine profile. Wearing this would not accentuate your masculinity in any way.

Initially it opens quite aromatic with a green artemisia combined with warm spices of nutmeg, cardamom and pimento. This is paired with a strikingly contrasting lime and mandarin which are juicy and tangy. A soft floral heart joins this odd medley of notes - namely orris, ylang and lily-of-the-valley. As the citrus begins to dissipate, the warm spices linger and begin to blend very well with the powdery florals - before a soft, creamy base of sandalwood and sweet tonka bean begins to emerge. This is a beautifully masculine and gentlemanly fragrance which does indeed exude wealth and power, however it’s a fairly strange blend of notes which won’t be for everyone and I really can’t see why this is priced so highly apart from being a publicity stunt.', ""Clive Christian No 1 is truly a magnificent work of art. Like any masterpiece let it speak to you first. I don't get the negative reviews posted here. This is British perfumery at its best and reminds me somehow of the luxurious life of the rich people of the Victorian London. I tried this fragrance first about ten years back at the Clive Christian Dubai Mall boutique and have never been without it since then. My experience at the friendly Clive Christian boutique was amazing. I also saw a rich Shaikh buying Clive Christian No 1 and leave in a hurry. This was then (just as it is now) a hugely popular fragrance.  I have been to a number of nutmeg warehouses where I have crushed and smelled the nutmeg. The spicy smell is very good. The moment I open the box (without even opening the lid of the bottle) I get wafts of intoxicating nutmeg, cardamom and florals. This opens with a heavenly, refined blast of finest cardamom, nutmeg and florals. Nutmeg & florals here remain prominent throughout. Aged Mysore sandalwood adds a great deal of depth to the perfume. Age has brought so many mellowed, aromatic changes in sandalwood as is evident here. This perfume will certainly get compliments for you. One spritz from the bottle on the sleeve and even after a wash it smells like some heavenly powder. Just make sure you buy from a very trusted source Expensive? Yep. Sadly the finest things in life are expensive."", 'I bought this perfume for my husband because of how impressed I was with this scent. I wear it from sometimes when I want to feel extremely powerful and Royal. The price is crazy but the scent is worth having even if it is the 10mls. I remember the first time some guys in my church smelt this perfume. When I applied one spray on one of the guys in the morning, he called me later in the evening to tell me that when he got home and hugged his Mum, she told him he smelt like a wealthy man.  So there you have it. The vibe you get from this perfume is rich dude who is confident to the core of his being.

If I didn't know better, I'd have guessed this was a 1950/1960s creation.  Leans more toward a feminine scent. I wear a lot of unisex fragrances, but I do think this would work much better for a woman. Has a lot of similarities to Chanel No 5. Definitely not worth the price.

I have not smelled this sample again until today and all of a sudden it is so much better than my initial reaction! This is still very much a vintage-smelling fragrance but so well blended. The white florals in this are sweet but not overbearing and everything blends together to create a green/white/citrusy concoction.

I feel there are other fragrances that do this better, such as Enslaved by Roja, or any of the three original recreated fragrances from Grossmith (Phul-Nana, Hasu-no-Hana, Shem El Nessim). Perhaps in 2001 this was ground-breaking though.  Not worth the price by any means.', ""Nice enough scent, overpriced to comical levels. Easy pass IMO, even discounted. For this type of animalic floral scent at a fraction of the price I'd grab Salome instead. At this price, if you're going there, I'd recommend Diaghilev or Spice & Wood over this, for example.

Bye Felicia', 'Inside the sumptuous gold dipped flacon of No. 1 masculine, an exuberant bouquet of aldehydic florals, ambers and spices celebrates a refined classic scent. Citrus-tinged heliotrope and iris combined with the intoxicating ylang-ylang reign the heart of the fragrance veiled in incense smoke. A subtle soapiness and pleasant sweetness carries itself throughout the fragrance.  Rich vetiver, cardamom and various other spices give the scent an intensely green, herbal undertone. The spices and woody backdrop as well as the indolic quality to the floral notes prevent them from being too vibrant.  No. 1 has an inherently vintage character yet to my nose it is still modern-smelling and relevant. The fragrance is unapologetically floral and heady for one that is marketed specifically for men but I quite like that unisex appeal. This scent will most likely not be for every man and requires an open-mindedness. The drydown lends itself to the sensuality of amber, copious amount of powdery musk and smoky sandalwood which round up the whole composition seamlessly with patchouli and a lick of creamy vanilla. I can see myself wearing this decadent scent mainly during the autumn/winter with its distinguished character and outstanding performance.', 'Major props to CC for creating a floral, powdery ""masculine"" scent (such an antiquated concept). The floral notes are quite heady. Plus, the powder factor is huge. On me, this smells a bit like L\'Heure Bleue with a lot of added ylang-ylang and rose or Chanel No. 5 with added heliotrope and more vanilla. It smells luxurious and lasts forever.

Wore it in the heat walking around outdoors shopping and having lunch. Good longevity, didn't seem to have crazy projection but I was sweating so that probably diluted it.  Didn't seem feminine on my skin. This is one I think I would need to spend some time with to get all the facets. Overall I think it's really good but I'm not going to mortgage a kidney for a bottle.

The middle notes are pretty dang apparent at first spray and the first 20ish minutes; however, the base and top notes start showing up after that half hour mark on my skin, and boy is it amazing. I love the complexity of the notes - somehow, they all work just so beautifully well. I implore everyone to at least try a sample spray or two of this. Really, you only need one or two sprays.

Upon spraying it on my first thought was ""Hmm I accidentely got the feminine version"" (since the Original Collection by Clive Christian had a Masculine and Feminine fragrance for every scent). Because it opens up with strong florals. Eventhough the top notes arent florals, the florals are the frontrunners from the start. Especially the Iris and Ylang-Ylang are the main players here, creating this enourmous clean soapy bubble. There are some spices listed and citrusses. The citrusses are only present in the start which give the scent the floral overdose, very supporting in this role. And after these fade, the spice show up. The floral soapy vibe is always present and at the foreground, but you can smell the spices in the back. It almost turns into a fougere type of fragrance. The base notes of sandalwood, amber, vanilla, musk, tonka, vetiver and cedar wood create the warmer, ambery dry down that is still soapy and powdery. Its a unique scent for a man. Unique since there arent many florals marketed towards men. I dont think many will like it though, it requires a special type of taste and and special type of style to pull this off! It will definitely impress those around you though, since this is a power scent!', 'This perfume is just dreadful! It gives me a similar sensation I got from Jaïpur Homme (not that they smell the same) in that it reeks of baby talcum powder with flowers and civet...a man is crazy if he wants to smell like this! Plus, a 50 ml. bottle sells for $600, which is an utter, ludicrous joke. What are they thinking? Conclusion: I\'d rather rub cat\'s pee on my body than wear this abomination. It should be renamed ""No. 1 Scrub-off.""', 'Last year I bought two 10ml bottles for the princely sum of £35 each. Now you can only buy the 50ml bottle for £525. Absolute joke that anyone would dare pay that price.', 'I just spilled half of my vtg sample, so I figured I might as well review it. Opens with a soapy quasi aldehydic LOTV citrus ylang-ylang combo. To give you an idea, if Chanel were to come up with something for the royals, it would probably smell similar to this. It\'s classic, not manly or blue or Fougere, but if a man wears this you just know he is something else. I honestly don\'t think any man can pull this off, as this can come across as grandma-ish, as the materials suggest it would.  If you go and drink a Dom Perignon and your next thought is: ""Did I just pay 400 bucks for a bottle of this?"" then this is not for you. The ingredients are top-notch quality, but they are built in a very refined way. Before the fragrance gives way to its heart, it turns slightly herbal and spicy without popping the bubble of soapiness. Then, you get a big iris/sandalwood/heliotrope, and then some rose. An amber starts to rise right after, and it\'s gorgeous. At this stage, the million bucks man is fully developed. There is something about floral ambers that scream luxury (1888 Xerjoff), and this is a hyper balanced aldehydic floral ambery treat with some woody backbone.  Regarding the price, you can find this in the 200-300 range easily, and compared to so many other luxe frags out there, the price is fair if you\'re purchasing a vintage. I wouldn\'t bother with the newer ones as they already went under L\'Oreal cost-cutting regimes.', ""I have the suspicion this has been reformulated. I bought a full bottle of this back in 2015 that I resold and I recently got a sample of this, and it smells different.  I remember this scent smelling like a million dollar man.

Can anyone confirm?"", ""Update: I've neglected wear this one for a while because I thought it wasn't great for Summer, but I wanted to break it back out. Man, I've missed it! I fell in love all over! THE best longevity of all fragrances I own! Projects great for at least 7 hours in heat, and it's a skin scent (a strong one at that) until you wash it off. Had it on almost 12 hours yesterday, and it was gorgeous all day! Felt like I should've had a pinstripe suit on instead, though. So pretty when first sprayed, although a little mature, but that wood that rolls in after is just wonderful. I never want to be without at least a 10 mL of this in my collection! Luckily, I've got a full bottle. It's so strong that it will last a looooong time because you have to apply so sparingly so you don't knock everyone out. Still 10/10 on every front for me!"", ""At first I wasn't sure. But the dry down it's like extra notes come out. Love it one of my faves. Smells old school distinguished gentlemen type.

Lasts very very long."", ""I've not been terribly impressed with the fragrances I've sampled from this house until this. This calls back to a whole different era in my imagination, a land before aqua scents where fresh was of no concern, and scents were captivating. This blend is magical, piercing the senses with a huge floral opening that smells very genuine, like a rare exotic jungle flower that is large and stands alone, emitting a warm, musky, yet pungent aroma bordering on pheromone. It dries into a most luxurious sandalwood with a slightly soapy or waxy floral note, like the smell of angel trumpet. A touch of tonka engages the wood, and the whole composition borders on too busy with it's epic palette, but holds together the whole way. Utterly elegant and seductive, this seems to me like it would be incredible on a woman's skin, it's very floral for a men's fragrance. Masterpiece."", 'It smells like the highest level of luxury and elegance. A perfect blend of floral,woody, spicy and powdery notes. A bit ""over the top"" floral in the start, but the magic comes in the drydown after 20-30 minutes. A nice, classy attire is required.', 'Got a small, very nicely priced decant. My first impression is Georgio Beverly Hills for Men, circa 1988. That\'s not a bad thing if you remember what it used to smell like (they still make it, modern formulation is a complete fraud). I swear it seems like some of today\'s expensive niche frags are what we used to be able to get at designer prices. Other examples include Original Santal (old Joop) and Beau du Jour (old Drakkar).  Edit (three months later): This stuff is truly fantastic, just the ultimate that I\'ve ever tried. Takes a bit getting used to but the floral opening is so rich it just doesn\'t bother me and of course the dry down is epic. I\'m not impressed by the price, I have no problem calling so many other CC\'s trash and X, while very nice, is not on par with the other two of the CC ""Big Three"" IMO. My point is this lives up to they hype. It performs well and smells divine. I\'ve found multiple decants in the $125-$150 oz range and it\'s worth every penny of that and more...', 'An authorized CC store decided to quit carrying the brand, and they cut prices in half. Combining with some coupon codes and rewards points, I purchased 4 from the brand (1872, No. 1, Rock Rose, and X) for much more relatively reasonable prices because I doubted I\'d ever get an opportunity to get shady eBay-like deals from a real boutique--no worry of authenticity or spoilage. Got this 50 mL for $382.50, normally $850-$865. I feel like that\'s worth mentioning. The box is identical to the others in the original collection, just a gold outer-box. Disappointing for a fragrance that\'s over double the cost. The bottle is a lovely gold glass. Only a slight imperfection at the bottom corner of my bottle--like a dent, which is ridiculous to have at this price. You can only tell if you\'re holding the bottle and looking at the bottom or looking from the right angle when it\'s sat down. This aside, picking up the bottle feels special; I\'m lucky to have this! I heavily debated on buying this, even at the ""good deal"" that I was getting. The first time I tried it, I thought it was straight old lady Chanel No. 5. As it settled in, I was on the fence. Then I tried it again, and this time got a heavily sprayed tester card to put in my car. That sold me. It was just so wonderful that I had that ""Okay, I get it"" moment. NO regrets buying this! Haters of this often likely can\'t afford it, want to talk it down, and probably go into smelling it without an objective nose. If you appreciate nicer things, you\'re going to appreciate this; it smells expensive without a doubt, even if the scent isn\'t quite your cup of tea. This is a scent for a dapper gentleman, which I like to pretend to be. This pairs perfectly with my finest suit, and it adds that perfect next level to stand out. It\'s the perfect amount of floral that ties in so nicely with the woody notes. Then there\'s just a hint of powder that tickles the nose to make this smooth--almost as if it\'s a bridge in the middle to join the floral and woody notes. It just keeps getting better all day. This is my confidence fragrance, which every man needs. Putting this on makes me feel like I need to be stepping into a Ferrari driving into London to broker a large contract, not a Jeep Cherokee heading into Jackson, Mississippi. You come to like the opening, which is granted a tiny bit old lady, but that phase only lasts about 10-40 minutes or so. Then it\'s just the most heavenly cloud of luxurious woody notes with a masculine floral. It\'s not sharp; it\'s suave. I don\'t think anyone could say it stinks. There may be a few people who don\'t like it, but you won\'t get anyone who just plain turns his or her nose up at you--or covers it. You only need a VERY small amount. I spray around a half spray on the wrist and behind the ear, and I\'m good for the day. This is very potent and intoxicating stuff. It\'s good year round I think, but it\'s going to shine best in any season but Summer. Don\'t get me wrong, I still have worn it a lot this Summer without regret and have loved it, but it\'s probably going to be even better when the temperature drops. Longevity is incredible, usually 10-12 hours or longer--often longer. It gets closer to the skin after about 6 hours, and really becomes closer to a skin scent after about 8 or so. I\'ve only had this for the hot and humid MS summer, so I can\'t comment fully on performance yet since my skin eats perfume when it\'s hot. However, it\'s performed very well for the conditions. Is this full bottle worthy? I think so. At $850? If you have the money and appreciate finer things enough and have run out of other fragrances that don\'t have you bored, then yes. Would I buy it at $850? No, I honestly wouldn\'t. Clive Christian directly sells a 10 mL for $95; I\'ll get that if I ever run out. I think that\'s not an awful price for this fragrance--especially since you must use it sparingly.

I am wearing it because it's been on me for Thanksgiving as a friend of mine gave it to me as a gift but I'm going to wrap it up and make it into a Christmas present for a friend. This is not my type of perfume. I hate to write a critically negative review and always find at least one thing to like about a fragrance. But this time there were too many dislikes. First of all the price ranges from 800 and up, and frankly I'd rather smell of an Avon perfume, or Stetson by Coty LOL This fragrance is dull and predictable and it's only merit is the unisex body. The top notes consist of citruses: sharp mandarin orange peel, and grapefruit galore. Fresh and sweet, with paprika mingling with grapefruit & spices of caraway and nutmeg. The scent smells fruity-spicy-floral. The floral heart is composed of rose, lily of the valley, ylang ylang heliotrope and jasmine. These flowers are normally found in women's fragrances. I don't think the flowers are interesting enough nor complex. There is no rose scent or heliotrope. I get mostly ylang ylang and a bit of jasmine. The florals seem to turn into a powder for a little bit.  Before long the masculine notes appear in the dry down which is where the base notes make their appearance. Vetiver, musk, and woodsy notes. This is a somewhat aromatic and woodsy vanilla dry down. But still it's not enough to get me excited. I prefer the dry down to something like Aramis Devin. This is woodsy but the florals and the fruit are the major players. Some men will find this too feminine. For it's price and all the hype, it's not worth it. There are much better frags from quality and expensive houses like CREED KILIAN and TOM FORD. So stick to any of those houses for better fragrances at pricy prices. This stuff is not worth the price or the packaging. This is the opposite of some great drug store fragrances like Emeraude which smell expensive at a cheap price.

Fresh yet indolic with prominent ylang, powdery iris and heliotrope. Gentle musky woods lead the floral bouquet into soft oriental territory. Very much like Roja's Britannia, No1 is a scent for a self-assured and relaxed gentleman who enjoys the more delicate, sweeter, floriental side of perfume art. There is a fine air of Chanel as well and an overall vintage touch telling stories of better times: a bygone age where gentle mannerism was the expression of masculinity and kindness, restrained temperament and generosity of a man were valued as his greatest assets. No1 is not a perfume to show off with; haters would never understand that No1 is not worn to brag but out of respect toward one's company - be it for afternoon tea, or being Best Man. The strength of No1 is just perfect; everpresent like an aura and as reliable a company as one's own shadow.  Very much the perfect scent because it gives back so much."", ""The best way I can describe this is that it smells almost like a unisex or woman's perfume that becomes a man's cologne when it dries down. The opening notes is very floral and smell strongly of jasmine, then when it dries down in an hour or two, it becomes very masculine with the woody notes. Longevity is long lasting and sillage is moderate on me. I'll wear this in the summer where it can dry down faster. It really does smell nice once it dries down, but I don't think it justifies the price. Not something I would buy again."", 'I can truly understand the hate/love relationship that people seem to have for Clive Christian No.1 for men. I used to be one of those haters but now I\'m lover. I don\'t know whether it\'s because my senses have changed or maybe it\'s that I never gave this scent a chance. Personally, I think this scent is misunderstood and it needs to be worn in a certain way. If your reviews/opinions on this scent are based on the first 10 minutes of its development, then you\'re not going to be satisfied. If you wear this on a cold, winter day, or evening, then you\'re probably not going to experience the pinnacle of its peak.  It is true, that the opening of this scent does resemble an ""old grandma perfume"". This scent is expensive ""ridiculously overpriced"". I think because these tend to be two of the most common reviews about No.1, it turns people off. With preconceived perceptions such as those, you\'re almost guaranteed to dislike it before you\'ve even given it a chance. I\'m not going to give you a breakdown of how this smells to me. A scent like this needs to be experienced. The best information I can provide you with is to buy a 1ml sample and try it on during the warm summer months or in warmer hemispheres/climates. I\'ve had women who have smelled this on a test strip and found it to be absolutely repulsing and I\'ve also had the very same women smell it on me and have commented ""OMG what are you wearing, you smell amazing"". Like I said get a sample... Pick a hot day or a tropical environment and wear it. I suggest applying it sparingly because too much will be a little over powering to the wearer. I would say this scent is more fitting for men ages 30-50. Give it a chance. Don\'t be distracted by its price or the first 10 mins of applying.', ""This fragrance represents the absolute disappointment. I don't see it as a worthy buying by all means let alone an overpriced expensive one. The only note that you'd notice is powder and nothing else.  5/10"", 'Excellent smell. I saw that my friends(His name is Mevlüt H.) and I first sniffed. He is a medical student. Very very lazy. He is in a huge debt because of to buy this fragrance. at the moment can not pay. He was planning to sell the kidneys. ""Atheist man should smell like, looks great,"" he said to me. I think that Muslim men should use it.', ""The composition opens with a hesperidic burst utilizing bergamot, lime, and Sicilian mandarin, which are gently mixed with spices of cardamom, nutmeg, caraway, and artemisia. The opening is certainly robust, and dare I say cloying and somewhat off putting initially. Heady florals dominate the second phase of Clive Christian's 'No. 1'. Muguet, rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, iris and heliotrope create a floral bouquet which initially rings very feminine for a male branded fragrance. Within this floral accord it is the exotic and indolent ylang-ylang which pierces through most prominently. Its searing yellow-floral scent is tamed by the powdery heliotrope and iris. In the base cedar, sandalwood, vetiver, amber, tonka bean and vanilla create a warm, sensuality. One is still able to notice the proceeding sweet florals, yet their femininity has been subdued by the musky, woody basenotes. It is here that the fragrance is at its most captivating.  For me, Clive Christian's 'No. 1' is all about contradictions. Here is a masculine fragrance utilizing an abundance of feminine florals. It is at once fresh and hesperidic, and then rich and oriental. Initially clean, powdery and later somewhat dirty and indolic. Unabashedly luxurious and original, I am hard pressed to compare 'No. 1' to any previously experienced fragrance of recent memory. Both elegant and refined, this composition seems perfect to be worn for a special and/or formal occasion. Its sillage, projection, and longevity are superb upon initial application, becoming average after one hour into the dry down. Due to its over reliance of floral heart notes, this can easily be considered unisex and worn by women. Many men may find it too feminine to personally own. I must admit my first reaction to smelling 'No. 1' was not a pleasant one. I found the overly harsh and cloying citrus, floral opening to be garish and obtrusive. With patience, the fragrance magically transformed itself into something quite beautiful after 30-60 minutes. I've learned to never again judge another scent based upon the initial few seconds after it being sprayed. Certainly it must live and breathe upon the skin first, allowing its full splendor to unfurl itself for our senses to adequately behold in its finest.

I dunno, it's all subjective. I have seen some lower priced selections and I have loved them. If something has value, just simply charge what it is worth.

When I sprayed this one on my wrists, I smelled an old-fashioned, classic but definitely a satisfying perfume. Just as I thought it would be. But was it so spectacular that I would pay that price? Definitely not! Would I bought this when it was cheaper? No. Would I even wear this when it was for free? Perhaps.

Now when you brand a perfume as the WORLD\'S MOST EXPENSIVE fragrance, you will almost immediately get haters. Guilty as charged I was one of them, sceptical as ever. Never really gave this fragrance a chance to prove itself in retrospect, until recently when I was strolling in the mail waiting for my lady (eternity by definition), I walked past a shelf of Clive and so thought, what the hell, and picked up No.1 Men, dosed myself a spray expecting nothing more than another disappointment. To my surprise, I was wow-ed.  This fragrance began with a lush of florals that transported me back to the Victorian era. I can almost see the nobles and royals mingling around each another. It is very pleasant and I started smelling myself non-stop. Dashed another spray to my chest and there it is again! Simply beautiful. A gentleman\'s scent truely. When I rejoined with my lady the first thing she said was this, word for word in awe, ""what magic did you spray, because you need more!"" I had another compliment by a stranger as we rode the lift down to the carpark. Then another one as at the ticket booth. By the end of the day, it was clear; this has to be purchased. Mind you I live in Asia, where people don\'t even apologise let alone compliment a stranger, so it was a huge shocker for me to land so many in 1 day, with 3 sprays of No.1. Now I understand the primary concern behind this fragrance; its crazy price. Almost around 12usd/ml. But if you are reading this, this means you are considering, so hear me out: don\'t walk away, there are cheaper options! I bought a tester bottle from UAE for 8usd/ml. Came with cap too. There was another listing for 6usd/ml but the mail was slightly too much for my destination. Bottomline, you can definitely get it cheaper.

The drydown is nice and soft but deep and long lasting as you'd expect. I for one like No.1 because it's very interesting but I'm not crazy about it either.  The unfortunate thing about the price it is another factor that it rules me out of ever buying it. It's above the threshold of what I deem to be exceptable for 50mls of fragrance but it's all relative if you love it and can afford it."", 'I dont know?? Gosh, feed an entire needy country...

This perfume, this house is legendary for having a reputation of being the most exclusive and expensive perfume in all the land. Regal and extravagant in its presentation in a golden Baccarat crystal bottle topped with a five carat diamond it is indeed a very beautiful package fit for a king. It received the 2006 FIFI award for packaging and presentation and deservedly so. Alas I found what comes in that sumptuous bottle to be an empty olfactory experience. The banquet hall is deserted. The king is dead.  It is not a bad scent by any means but simply ordinary and fleeting at best in longevity. On my skin it dies in its youth lasting at most an hour. At these prices heads should roll for not living up to the hype.  The house claims to use the very best and most expensive of ingredients and I am sure they do but these notes do not come together with anything original, memorable or remarkable. The fragrance opens in a citrus and spice blend of lime, Mandarin Orange, grapefruit, and cardamom, nutmeg, artemisia, caraway that comes off to me as a simple orangeade soda pop. This fizzles out within seconds of hitting the skin. The central notes of rose, lily of the valley, iris, ylang-ylang and heliotrope is simply a floral muddle to my nose. It struggles to bloom only do wither into my skin so swiftly as to make it near impossible for me to explore and enjoy what should be happening at this point. There is hardly a dry down where there are supposed to be notes of vanilla, Virginia cedar, vetiver, Tonka bean, musk and sandalwood. My skin very rarely eats a fragrance alive but on every testing of No.1 it swallowed the fragrance in one hungry gulp.  There are other Clive Christian perfumes out there to be explored and I do hope to find one that is more giving and generous than No.1 has proven to be. We shall see if the house of Clive Christian does have a perfume worthy of a king’s ransom. If not, then off with his head!

On the other hand, CC1 for Women is everything and it is so good that I bought it at the spot. I didn't get the full size bottle then as US$850/50ml was really too much to spend on one fragrance but did get the travel set of 10ml each of 1872 and X and No 1 for women for US$250, which is more affordable. As a lover of CC fragrances and happy owner of C for men, X for men, No 1 for women, 1872 for women and X for women, IMO I think No 1 for men is just too 'manly' to my taste. I'm by no mean saying No 1 for men is not a good fragrance as it is just not me. However, I must point out that CC fragrances are made with mostly high quality natural ingredients and they need time to develop on your skin.

I will test it one day when I am out and about and see if I get compliments. To me, for 800 bucks for a FB, there is NO WAY I am ever going to pay that. It's just not that unique. To my nose and experience and reaction to the juice, I found that Gold by Amouage is much better. That's my story and I'm sticking to it. I suppose if you are married to a rock star, or a socialite then you can wear this. Even if I were in that status, there's many more gems out there that smell rich and lovely i.e. Amouage line.

Combining with some coupon codes and rewards points, I purchased 4 from the brand (1872, No. 1, Rock Rose, and X) for much more relatively reasonable prices because I doubted I\'d ever get an opportunity to get shady eBay-like deals from a real boutique--no worry of authenticity or spoilage. Got this 50 mL for $382.50, normally $850-$865. I feel like that\'s worth mentioning. The box is identical to the others in the original collection, just a gold outer-box. Disappointing for a fragrance that\'s over double the cost. The bottle is a lovely gold glass. Only a slight imperfection at the bottom corner of my bottle--like a dent, which is ridiculous to have at this price. You can only tell if you\'re holding the bottle and looking at the bottom or looking from the right angle when it\'s sat down. This aside, picking up the bottle feels special; I\'m lucky to have this! I heavily debated on buying this, even at the ""good deal"" that I was getting. The first time I tried it, I thought it was straight old lady Chanel No. 5. As it settled in, I was on the fence. Then I tried it again, and this time got a heavily sprayed tester card to put in my car. That sold me. It was just so wonderful that I had that ""Okay, I get it"" moment. NO regrets buying this! Haters of this often likely can\'t afford it, want to talk it down, and probably go into smelling it without an objective nose. If you appreciate nicer things, you\'re going to appreciate this; it smells expensive without a doubt, even if the scent isn\'t quite your cup of tea. This is a scent for a dapper gentleman, which I like to pretend to be. This pairs perfectly with my finest suit, and it adds that perfect next level to stand out. It\'s the perfect amount of floral that ties in so nicely with the woody notes. Then there\'s just a hint of powder that tickles the nose to make this smooth--almost as if it\'s a bridge in the middle to join the floral and woody notes. It just keeps getting better all day. This is my confidence fragrance, which every man needs. Putting this on makes me feel like I need to be stepping into a Ferrari driving into London to broker a large contract, not a Jeep Cherokee heading into Jackson, Mississippi. You come to like the opening, which is granted a tiny bit old lady, but that phase only lasts about 10-40 minutes or so. Then it\'s just the most heavenly cloud of luxurious woody notes with a masculine floral. It\'s not sharp; it\'s suave. I don\'t think anyone could say it stinks. There may be a few people who don\'t like it, but you won\'t get anyone who just plain turns his or her nose up at you--or covers it. You only need a VERY small amount. I spray around a half spray on the wrist and behind the ear, and I\'m good for the day. This is very potent and intoxicating stuff. It\'s good year round I think, but it\'s going to shine best in any season but Summer. Don\'t get me wrong, I still have worn it a lot this Summer without regret and have loved it, but it\'s probably going to be even better when the temperature drops. Longevity is incredible, usually 10-12 hours or longer--often longer. It gets closer to the skin after about 6 hours, and really becomes closer to a skin scent after about 8 or so. I\'ve only had this for the hot and humid MS summer, so I can\'t comment fully on performance yet since my skin eats perfume when it\'s hot. However, it\'s performed very well for the conditions. Is this full bottle worthy? I think so. At $850? If you have the money and appreciate finer things enough and have run out of other fragrances that don\'t have you bored, then yes. Would I buy it at $850? No, I honestly wouldn\'t. Clive Christian directly sells a 10 mL for $95; I\'ll get that if I ever run out. I think that\'s not an awful price for this fragrance--especially since you must use it sparingly.

When you wear the perfume of CC for the first time, you don't really like it (it's very different from all other perfumes, where the head notes are very pleasant and you immediately buy them, but after an hour, or even worse: after you've purchased it, you understand that you don't really like the main notes). Like I told here, CC perfumes are really different: you start to love them after you are wearing them at least for 30 min. So, ask for samples and try to wear them for a whole day, then decide if you like them. I'm sure you will!"", 'I won\'t be saying too much about this perfum, out of all my Clive Christian\'s (CC\'s) this is the most disapointing when you take into account it\'s ridiculous price tab, It isn\'t always true you see that ""you get! what you pay for!"".  After dry down No.1 is far too floral for me to be a male fragrance, for me anyway, that said after an hour to 3hrs No.1 is at it\'s best, then quickly fades away far too soon, all in all a bit one dimensional also for my liking with the prominent floral notes employed. I must say It\'s 1872, or ""X"" in the old CC\'s for me or even more so with the new generation of CC\'s, ""V"" or ""C"" have lasting power, that fully excite my senses and more than justify the price tag. ************************************************************************************ Update further to my above review and my personal dislike, my daughter as now taken my No.1 for men and she likes it.  On one hand I am pleased the parfum as gone to good use and not wasted. However I also worry that now she may aquire a taste for it, and thats not good when you take into account N0.1\'s ridiculous price.

The advertising on the bottle is embarrassing... Foolishly snob...', ""Nice enough scent, overpriced to comical levels. Easy pass IMO, even discounted. For this type of animalic floral scent at a fraction of the price I'd grab Salome instead. At this price, if you're going there, I'd recommend Diaghilev or Spice & Wood over this, for example. CC No 1 might've been noteworthy in 2001 but I honestly couldn't care less wearing it today."", ""I was given the travel pack for men as a present and when trying the No1 I was very surprised that this is classed as a Mans scent, this is totally feminine and smells mainly of floral scents. I can't see how any man could pull this off without anyone assuming that they were wearing a unisex or women's perfume.  Maybe i got a fake set, so will be taking a trip down to Harrods and test it there. I would say that you can tell the ingredients used were top notch and the packaging was very classy i don't think you can fake this product so maybe i do have a legit travel set but the scent doesn't work well on my skin."", 'This perfume is just dreadful! It gives me a similar sensation I got from Jaïpur Homme (not that they smell the same) in that it reeks of baby talcum powder with flowers and civet...a man is crazy if he wants to smell like this! Plus, a 50 ml. bottle sells for $600, which is an utter, ludicrous joke. What are they thinking? Conclusion: I\'d rather rub cat\'s pee on my body than wear this abomination. It should be renamed ""No. 1 Scrub-off.""']"

So this is the main trick for me to smell what I actually tasted a couple of times in premium fragrance boutiques to switch my sensory receptors to smell another scent.

Top notes are Eucalyptus, Citruses, Grapefruit and Tangerine; middle notes are Nutmeg and Pepper; base notes are Pine Tree, Cedar, Incense and Vetiver.

The opening notes of juicy citruses, mainly oranges and grapefruit, are accented with a beautifully smooth eucalyptus note. I'm reminded of some walks I've taken in the Northwest California coast, particularly how I felt the first time I did so, where the marine air carries the smell of the eucalyptus trees across your skin in a slightly sticky and salty way. Combined with the wide breadth of citrus notes, there's this feeling of a huge expanse stretched out in front of you. 1828 is making me feel the way I felt during that first walk through a coastal eucalyptus forest - the smell of the trees, the ocean you can hear before you can see it, to finally emerge from the tree line and see the Pacific in front of you. I can't recall the last time I smelled a perfume whose opening felt so enormous, but without clobbering you over the head. For as big as it feels, it's not terribly powerful and overwhelming - just like looking out at the ocean from the shore, you get a sense of enormity and power without having to experience that power in full. It's an absolutely brilliant opening to a perfume.  As these top notes begin to dry down you get this feeling of descent. The perfume begins to close-in on itself and get really tight by projecting earthy seed spice notes of nutmeg and cinnamon, yet it's a black pepper note - slightly fruity, spicy and piquant, round and glass-like - that gives the effect of your environment closing in around you. You're walking into the forest, dense and tight, visibility to nil. Or, you're descending into the bowels of the Earth through a tight cave as Jules Verne would have imagined. But before this becomes a bit overwhelming and unsettling, the perfume moves quickly through these heart notes to bring forth airy and luminescent pine, myrrh, and vetiver. After the experience of the heart notes you really get the feeling of a breath of fresh air and openness with these base notes, like I've just passed through the center of the Earth from the eucalyptus forests of California to come out the other side somewhere in Asia. The vetiver is typical vetiver, a bit wet, salty, swampy, and very green, but the pine and myrrh notes, which lock hand-in-hand incredibly well, are so effervescent and breathable that the vetiver doesn't come across as overtly swampy and close. The pine and myrrh allow the vetiver's more challenging aspects to actually be refreshing rather than cloying. Nothing in the base scratches at you or challenges you; it refreshes you, relaxes you while maintaining the energy of excitement that got you started - your amazing journey is over, now time to reflect.  I am absolutely bowled over by 1828. Every stage is unique yet cohesively stitched together to be exciting and evocative, but never feels less than sophisticated and gentlemanly. Full marks to Sylvie Jourdet for a brilliant composition. At the end of the day, yes, this is another citrus and woody vetiver - one of a million. In that sense it is not anything special. But every single note played by this perfume is pitch perfect, perfectly timed, and of a high-quality timbre. It's that execution that allows me to go on a journey with it, one I would be very happy to repeat."", 'Smells amazing but performance is 1/10', 'I hate gendering scents, but I will say this has the connotations of ""traditionally masculine"" written all over it. Wear whatever smells good on you, but it smells like a classy dad scent to me, which is a vibe that doesn\'t need to be pulled off by actual classy dads.  The blend of citrus, nutmeg, and pepper, make for a lightly citrus spicy opening, which is pretty long lasting. I really don\'t get eucalyptus. I wouldn\'t describe this as camphoric at all. The drydown is extremely smooth. It\'s so well blended than honestly none of the basenotes really stand out. I\'d say it\'s more warm than dry, maybe very very lightly sweet. Definitely not incense-y in the sense of smoky or strong, and the wood notes are subtle and not sharp.  I think this is masterfully balanced, which is something I look for. Also the projection and longevity are better than I expected after reading other reviews.  Scent: 9/10 Longevity: 8/10 Projection: 8/10 Full bottle? I had a sample and bought a 60ml shortly after. Definitely worth it!', 'My first thought upon sniffing this is “Dad would love this!” He probably wouldn’t; I shudder to think what would happen if I actually bought him a $210 bottle of perfume. But the bone-dry abstract cologne opening of 1828 reminds me of something my dad used to wear when I was a kid. And, as such, it gives me an unbelievably powerful scent memory. All’s right with the world, you are being hugged by your Daddy who knows how to do everything, who can draw a horse with realistic musculature and speaks every language in the world and knows things about cars and airplanes… more prosaically, it’s a dry, crisp, gray-green, classically abstract masculine scent chord. Luca Turin calls it “direct, effortless, virile elegance” and he’s right. there’s a sort of late-90’s “hi-tech” radiance about the aromachemicals — it was released in 2001, after all— and some commenters think it smells like cK One. In my book, that’s no bad thing; there’s nothing wrong with clean, crisp aromachemicals if they’re done right, and (say it with me now) The 90s Were Good Actually. a few minutes in, 1828 has a warmer, mellower creamy-spicy brown nuance (the nutmeg?) complementing the dry bitter pale-green opening. and half an hour in, there’s a pale coumarin (tonka?) glow underlying the whole thing…while it still retains its dry crisp freshness and aura of masculine expertise. An hour in, 1828 has landed, in a creamy-spicy (yet still light and radiant) coumarin-nutmeg place, ivory flecked with copper. It reminds me slightly of the cheerful masculine vanilla-tonka note in The Third Man; it’s innocent, honest joy, a guy whistling unselfconsciously in the bright air.', 'I want to like it. There’s a bottle available at a reasonable price…  But… Iso E, pepper, nutmeg, vetivetyl acetate… yawn. Even if made with the best sources available in the hands of an experienced perfumer.  It goes from escape, to Nina Ricci’s Mémoire d’Homme, to ck One, to their own 1725…  Well, I’m trying to control my impulses, cause even with that kind of discount, I don’t think it’s worth the plata… Lord, have mercy upon my collector’s soul.', 'Bought a tester and absolutely love it! A must-have for old-school enthusiasts—regal, distinguished, and top-notch quality. The opening is a beautifully balanced blend of eucalyptus, camphor, and sweet citrus, seamlessly anchored by a subtle yet formidable leather and patchouli base. Definitely signature scent-worthy!', ""A great fougere with lots of pine and woods. Has freah eucalyptus and citruses mixed in, and a big dose of a glorious nutmeg. Has a soapy touch, but not generic soap. All of the ingredients are of high quality and the fragrance is masterly blended. A beautiful Tangerine shows up more throughout the weartime.  Spring, summer and fall fragrance. Daytime wear, but night time capable. Great for work and casual wear, but will easily work for fully formal events too. Classy and very wearable. Probably best suited for men at the age range 30's and up.  Personal score: 7.75/10. A great fougere with a uplifting feel to it. I'd happily wear this, any day, any time.

Green too. If you like Creed Green Irish Tweed you might like this too.', '1828 opens with such a strong citrus note, I could see a three dimensional lemon in my mind. It feels masculine right from the start, with notes of wood and Vétiver in the background of the citrus. Then eucalyptus comes to play, and it gets very aromatic and camphoraceous. It reminds me a bit of a shower steamer you might want to use if you weren’t feeling well at this point, but not in a bad way. Perhaps a bit medicinal but also very bracing and refreshing. And then cardamom comes in and things take a sweet and spicy turn, although citrus is still in the picture. The eucalyptus turns into a deeper and smoother pine, still bracing but not as medicinal. It’s a wonderful pine, green and resinous.  Over time the wood becomes much stronger in the mix and the bracing feeling gets toned down into a smooth sweet wood with a hint of spice. It’s really lovely at this stage, and so different from its open, which is also good but in such a different way. I’m a woman that generally loves a unisex fragrance, but to my taste this is completely masculine. It’s classic but modern, and very beautiful. This is a fun experience in a fragrance, even if it doesn’t sound like your thing I recommend sampling it.', ""In the beginning, very citrusy. Not only citrus but, medicinal in a way. Non-violent. It's somber and smooth. The dry down is heavenly with a consistent incense and vetiver note. The longevity is great, becomes more of a skin scent after a few hours. Not the type of fragrance that blasts people away with projection. It's confident, but doesn't need to shout to be known as so."", 'Citrusy, piney, and fresh. Yeah, I’m digging this.', 'Weird, woody, powdery, dusty. A bit like concrete.', ""1828 is a tribute to Jules Verne, but since Beethoven died in 1828, I'll compare this beautiful perfume to a Beethoven symphony.  Exposition: one of the most beautiful grapefruit notes I have smelled in perfumery. It is so realistic, it actually transported my mind back to a time so far back in my childhood when we used to eat grapefruit (doused in sugar of course) every morning. Main Theme of citrus gives way to the secondary theme of pine and they blend for the remainder of the exposition. Development: Nutmeg joins the swirling themes from the exposition. The warm spice modulates with camphorous eucalyptus into remote keys, far removed from the opening citric harmonies. But the reminder of the citrus never fully fades- there is a sweetness emerging that is both delightful and unexpected. Recapitulation: As the composition comes to a gentle conclusion, we are left with the most beautiful sweet dry down I have come across. Do not think of designer-scent-level syrupy, overwrought sweet accords. This is subtle, gentle, and so incredibly pleasant. It must be the nutmeg and remnants of citrus with a slightly green woodiness. This is an amazing coda to a fragrance masterpiece.  A rare 10/10 for me, I would wish to change nothing about 1828. A gentlemanly perfume of the world. If I could only have one fragrance, this would be a contender! Beautiful."", 'Fougere but not a fougere. Chypre but not a chypre. Opens up fresh, a touch powdery and very green with the head of eucalyptus and citrus.The interplay of eucalyptus, pine, vetiver give off a ""typical"" barbershop smell that encompasses both fougere and chypre in my book. This is soften by warm spiciness of nutmeg and aromatic, floral touch of black pepper. Lasts pretty decent on my skin, with moderate sillage. Thoroughly enjoyed this.', ""A virile, old school fougère minus the lavender; a more palatable and more complex, citrusy version of Amouage's Bracken Man, with pine substituting cypress and some eucalyptus thrown in for good measure.

Edit: 03/12/24 - Okay, so several weeks of sniffing and enjoying my sample I just can't seem to splash out on a bottle. Maybe if it were half the price I would. I really like it, but I don't find it special enough to warrant the rather lofty expense. I nevertheless highly recommend sampling if you like old school. Re-edit: 05/02/24 - Really enjoying this again, and considering buying a bottle! Re-re-edit: 12/27/24 - Bought a tester and loving it! Definitely for old school enthusiasts. Regal, distinguished, great quality. Loving the eucalyptus/camphor/sweet citrus combo in the opening anchored by a subtle but formidable leather/patchouli base. Signature scent worthy!"", ""I am so mindblown by this fragrance. And I can’t for the life of me figure out why most reviewers here believe that women can’t pull it off, because to my nose and on my skin it is perfectly unisex. Histories de Parfums missed the mark deciding not to market this in their officially unisex category. (They’re rare in that they use the categories “for him”, “for her”, and “unisex”.) The citrus top doesn't feel energizing and bright as citrus tops typically do. Instead of the norm, 1828’s citrus is immediately and deeply calming, wrapped up in that soothing eucalyptus, cosy nutmeg, and smooth incense. If I could only use one word to describe 1828, that’s what it would be— smooth. It’s well blended right away. Sweetness (sap?) dancing with evergreen and camphorous aromatics, one of my favorite kinds of perfume magic. I don’t get the grapefruit, and I don’t get fresh orange juice. I get an aged orange tea, and it’s so beautiful. This is quintessentially versatile in both time of day and season. The slight sweetness and deep incense lend 1828 to day or night, winter to spring to summer to fall. As far as value? You can pick up 60mL for around $70. That’s a steal for this quality. I blind bought this, and it was a safe blind buy in my eyes. Even if it doesn’t wow you like it has me, I can’t see anyone finding this unwearable putting aside very rogue skin chemistry. Women who love unisex scents, try this. I don’t think you’ll be disappointed. And to the men— if I smelled this on a man, I’d never be able to take my face out of his neck. Sexy and cosy. Wrapped up in blankets."", ""Tame and clean smelling woody/citrus I was expecting more earthiness and smokiness reading the notes breakdown so I’m a bit disappointed.  Overall a nice scent that has a sharp freshness to it. Honestly for this type of scent profile though I’d rather go with something like Jovoy L'Art de la Guerre"", 'A Tribute to Jules Verne... The discovery set insert reads: ""In honor of the father of literary science fiction, and the ocean that inspired his extraordinary novels of adventure, an aquatic fragrance with fresh citrus notes, and an adventurous aromatic base."" I could imagine Shazad Latif wearing this as he stars as Captain Nemo in Nautilus (2023), based on Jules Verne\'s famous work, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.  I just have a sample that\'s had a chance to age, and the camphor notes are really toned down, and it\'s turned quite sweet, but still gives a citrus aromatic impression, with sweeter woody notes underneath. I don\'t get much of an aquatic vibe but the discovery set insert calls this an ""aromatic aquatic"". I\'m getting a sweeter, slightly leather-y aromatic scent. Enjoy!', ""Opens with a pine note that has a soft leathery nuance, and the mix of nutmeg and pepper make it feel like a very serious fragrance, immediately reminded me of a milder version of Russian Leather by Memo, and scents like Bottega Veneta Pour Homme (and its flankers). But as it stays on skin, a gentle sweetness comes through from the tangerine, a subtly vibrant eucalyptus notes with some soft citrus make this creamier, and blend in beautifully with the green pine note, giving this fragrance a cold character. The vetiver and a somewhat cleanly done incense stay throughout the life of the scent in the background. Overall this is a really nice mature, signature worthy scent, that's done well balancing subtlety and a sense of authoritativeness, refined with some persona. 7.5/10"", 'On paper - eucalyptus prominent on top, then citrus-rounded-vetiver. No incense at all. On my skin - much less eucalyptus (or at least it lifts off my skin very quickly). My skin turns the citruses sweet (which is fine), and interestingly enough I get the incense only on my skin. Less vetiver, though still prominent. Nice! Like a niche version of TDH. Scent: Clean, simple daily scent. Citrus-vetiver with some incense in the base. 8/10 Projection: Soft to average Longevity: Average Polarity: Unisex to masculine', 'This is a clean vetiver fragrance, not in the barbershop genre Whatsoever. Opening is uninteresting, mid is generic.  Overall this Smells mainly of clear & clean vetiver, eucalyptus, and a dash of nutmeg. You get wafts of incense in the mid.  Zero citrus. Not sweet. Minimal wood. NOT in the realm of Russian Leather at all! More like Grey Vetiver! Can be worn year round. Dries down to a smooth soapy clean lite vetiver scent that is Pleasant in the air. First 4hrs Not my cup of tea really, but as a Vetiver fragrance it’s solid, nothing groundbreaking though. The far, far dry down is great.. vetiver fades away a lot leaving The eucalyptus giving off that subtle soapy clean aroma is very calming at bed time 🤤.', 'Smells super sexy on a virile man of a certain age(35+) It\'s ""fresh-green"", woody, with some mild, natural sweetness. For me, it smells like something from Geo F Trumper: handsome, clean and sophisticated. Both longevity and projection are very good.', ""1828 smells handsome and dignified. Echoes of classic barbershop scents are evident, but there is a surprising complexity here: the bracing, almost medicinal camphor of eucalyptus leaf in the top notes, supported by citrus, gives me a rush. A pine accord that follows fuses this effect into the heart of warm, dry, yet smooth nutmeg. This is anchored by something that seems like a peppery elemi, and somewhat smoky woods. It's vivacious and winsome sensibility may not be the sort of challenge a fumehead may crave, but I love the lucid directness of 1828. There are moments that remind me of a pine forest after the rain, and that in and of itself is worth the price of admission."", 'Very mild eucalyptus mist with natural, zesty citric aromas. Stars off a bit pissy but that wears off with time. Refined and elegant. Sandalwood, vanilla, cedar, pine and nutmeg work their way into the nuance, which shines more as the base dulls and fades. Here’s where the scent gets more masculine.  VG.', 'Great slightly sweet tangerine and bright fresh grapefruit opening. But that opens up into a smoky nutmeg with citrus hiding around the edges. Pleasant to sit with. It reminds me of dry forests. Not glaring. Could easily wear this in the office without bothering people but still have something just slightly different. I don\'t get any ""powder"" since it doesn\'t have lavender or iris.', 'Update: I wore this again today after some air got in the bottle and the nutmeg is toned down (yet still evident), and I\'m getting more of the eucalyptus and woods balancing the creamy sweetness. Really enjoyed the whole experience. Still get the eggnog association due to first smelling nutmeg in eggnog as a child... 1828 completely subverted my expectations based on notes...which is often the case, and just reinforces my ""always sample if possible"" rule.  Strangely, the strongest association that came up immediately for me was, of all things...Eggnog. The creamy and nutmeg spiced holiday brew. The single most dominating note I pick up in this is spiced, sweet nutmeg, followed by some very creamy, smooth, almost milky woody type notes. You would almost think sandalwood would be a listed note, not cedar, vetiver and pine.  I do not get strong citrus as I expected (there\'s three different types listed) nor do I get much incense, or other notes popping out at me. It\'s pretty well-blended, and if it were not for the dominant nutmeg I would get more of amorphous smooth creamy blob, lacking any highs or lows. There is one note as it dries down that I perceive as a sharp texture, rather than definable note. It kind of crawls straight up my nose. Perhaps it is the pine/eucalyptus note, or more likely some unnamed aromachem. Hoping this smooths out over time. I wish this had a touch more earthiness, drier wood notes, noticeable incense, and a more prominent eucalyptus. I do think I like 1828, and am hoping with time and air my 15ml travel sprays develops or I start to pick up more of the nuances.  As is, I\'ll tuck this away as a perfect daytime holiday fragrance. Just a bit too creamy, sweet, and smooth for me to use as a daily driver or summertime fragrance.', ""Testing blind, this opened with a fresh and green feeling that lasted about 30-40 minutes, after which it becomes warmer with a hint of smokeniess, and has a familiar vetiver feel. It also reduced to an intimate skin scent within an hour, and although it hung out for a while I'd argue it is difficult to give it a longevity longer than eight hours realistically. Looking at the notes now, I don't feel some are noticable. While some citrus and herbs add to the fresh green feeling at the opening it dries down as mainly the clear vetiver leaning a bit cleaner and green. I can't really notice anything of incense or nutmeg, and it's not nearly as citrus as the number of citrus notes listed suggests. It leans fresh but not really citrus at all, more clean and fresh intimate vetiver after 30-40 minutes. Nice and pleasant but more projection I would desire. Few more wearings after getting another sample. Opening still green but noticing a distinct citrus front with a hint of spice than before."", 'Very nice frag. I get slight hints of hemmimgway in this also', 'Worn side by side with Creed Spice and Wood. This is honestly better, and at a fraction of the cost. This will be in my collection until I die.

It reminds me of my dad's shaving cream, walking in the woods, and feeling expensive $$$ It leans more masculine, but I prefer that in fragrance.  Makes you feel like the chillest version of a femme fatale who just left her lovers penthouse, spritzed on his cologne, and headed to the art gallery she owns. Will always have a bottle of this around!"", ""I really like this one. I've been trying to find some fragrances that are appropriate for the warmer months and daytime wear, and this is a lovely option. The nutmeg keeps the woodiness a little sweet and light as the citrus fades while avoiding the creaminess some woody scents can reach that I enjoy smelling but not wearing. It feels both classic and playful to me. Definitely skews a bit masculine due being at least fougère adjacent (and I suspect the house agrees with me, since it's under their For Him section) but is unisex enough that I think anyone who's fond of the notes could enjoy it.  I don't know if I quite like it enough to get a full bottle or keep it in my collection long term, but I look forward to using the rest of the generous decant of it I have on hand to get a proper feel for it. My partner, who's less of a fragrance enthusiast, also immediately complimented how it smelled it rather than just noting that I was wearing something."", 'What a beautiful, elegant, modern fougere.

Past the immediate opening, this comes off as ""fresh musky"" to my nose. I’m not sure if it\'s really musk or if it’s the camphorous accord coming off musky. This is a very “masculine clean” sort of scent, leaning toward barbershop. This feels classic and seems like a safe all-purpose fragrance without being a “freshie” or “blue”. But this also smells a bit like a deodorant fragrance. Fresh, clean, woodsy, slightly musky, slightly spicy, slightly sweet, slightly medicinal from the camphor.  Very pleasant scent. I enjoy this and would wear this, but I’m not sure I could justify a whole bottle.', ""Sweet aromatic woody citrus. Well done but not my genre.

A perfect achievement. Rating - 9/10', 'On my skin this fragrance is super bright and almost reminiscent of a barbershop in a way. Clean and refreshing. You can definitely pick out the eucalyptus notes, and on the dry down it becomes more woodsy.', 'Opens as a cool breeze with eucalyptus and what I thought was rosemary but is probably nutmeg. I smell very little citrus.  Later a number things happen to it, something sweet along with the breeze.  2nd wear: I quite like it. It\'s like little pellets of different smelling substances all grayish blue, green and turquoise shades. 3rd wear: Yeah, I like it. The eucalyptus is the clou here for me. It stays there for the whole duration and has a quite a unique ""blunt vegetal freshness"". 1828 might not be a huge compliment magnet, but won\'t offend anyone either, and you certainly won\'t smell like average cologne guys. Rounded up to Like because of the uniqueness.', ""I didn't realise this scent was for men when I tried it. Comes on with a strong masculine cologne but quickly lifts. This smells like 'pirate' to me - fresh sea air, rich wood, a touch of sharp green and something smoky. Quite creamy and yet invigorating. It fades quite quickly to a soft skin-scent on me that's mostly wood. I wouldn't buy this, but it definitely invokes an adventurous spirit."", '1828 is so unique! It\'s has to be that eucalyptus note, it sticks out through the entire fragrance profile for all 7+ hours. I hadn\'t smell Terre\'d Hermes, but when I finally did 1828 was an almost perfect match if not superior in all facets. If you read the description of the fragrance on their website it details this as ""smelling like a chest made of high quality woods full of spices from across the seas."" I couldn\'t have said it better myself. I didn\'t like it at first, but it\'s now my signature scent and I\'m very glad I picked up the biggest bottle. 10/10 fragrance.', 'This fragrance was originally named ""1828-Jules Verne"" when HdP premiered it: they originally called their perfumes after famous people and the year they were born, but later dropped the names and just left the years, so now it is just ""1828."" This is confusing, since HdP also carries a fragrance similarly called ""1826,"" which was originally also named after Empress Eugenie and is quite feminine in its notes. So make sure you know which one you\'re getting if you buy this or order a sample. The idea behind naming it after Jules Verne is that it\'s evocative of the fresh fields and pastures new celebrated in his adventure stories, particularly ""Around the World in 80 Days."" This opens with all kinds of different citrus (mostly grapefruit) that is backed up by woods and vetiver, and with nutmeg done absolutely right at the heart of it. It\'s not a fougére, but it\'s quite fresh. This would make an absolutely perfect office fragrance because it smells so clean and open. It has average projection, but it lasts a long time.', 'This smells vintage and modern at the same time. A nice woody/spicy scent with fresh citrus undertone. I like this one.', ""Simply put, if you like barbershop or woody fragrances you'll like this because it blends those two genres. I find it absolutely addictive. I've tried almost everything from the Histories house, and this is still at the top and below that it's 1826, Irreverent, Prolixe, This is not a blue bottle original, 1.3, and 1.5.  It does have a vintage feel, but not super dated. The opening is really well done with citruses and eucalyptus which is not too camphoric, t's perfectly balanced. The drydown is where this really shines. Creamy cedarwood with a bit of spice, pine cade, a transparent incense, and a touch of turpenes. This has been my signature scent lately, and I have a hell of lot of cologne. I even keep a bottle in my office. Leans heavily masculine imo. If you like Creed Spice and Wood, get this.  Scent 10/10 Performance 5/10"", ""I found this one to be a surprise in timing, a play with a pleasant but interminable first act, where following intermission the second serves only to trail off with an ellipsis. It begins with a huge orangey citrus, like satsuma aromatherapy oil. Blended in are green notes with a firm and undefined base. Here it reminds me strongly of the opening of D&G The One, but where that will move on to the warmth of tobacco and amber, this is more austere, and anyhow it's not even remotely finished with the opening. The citruses linger in all their richness for nearly a full 45 minutes, a triumph on its own, and then the lemon top end of nutmeg threads the needle to a more old school drydown, herbaceous with an undercurrent of vetiver and just a wisp of incense. I thought the greenery was thyme at first, but as things cleared up in the drydown it became apparent that that was the eucalyptus, lingering for the length of the composition, from first adding counterpoint to the citrus it finally gets a few lines of its own. A bit of an anticlimax of a drydown all things considered, but graceful. Competent and interesting, even if not something quite as spectacular as a 1740. Gosh, I love this house."", ""I absolutely adore this scent! I lean towards fresh, lean fragrances as I live in a very warm climate, and find this to be perfectly unisex and not at all generic men's cologne as some other reviewers have flagged. Very clean with an interesting undertone, probably the eucalyptus. Lasts a long time on me with minimal sprays."", 'A good spring morning in heaven...... یک صبح خوب بهاری در بهشت...... ا', ""It just smells like generic Man Cologne to me. I've worn it a few times desperately searching for something to like about it, since the notes make it seem right up my alley. Alas, all I get is cheap shaving cream and Eau de My Dad in the 90's."", ""The way this opened, I was thinking this was just going to be another pleasant soapy, citrus, aromatic vetiver fragrance-but I really like the way that this one developed!! This does start out as a soapy citrus and vetiver, and there's something that is a bit distinct, which I'm assuming is the eucalyptus. Then a slightly sweet orange comes in along with the nutmeg and this soooo good! it has a bit of an old-school men's fragrance vibe, which I really love. I actually think it's quite sexy. The dry down to my nose is incense/resins, spices and some woods. I would say this is unisex leaning masculine. I'm a female and I would wear this, and I'd also really enjoy smelling it on a man."", 'This is a very nice unisex fragrance. Opens with airy eucalyptus.

To me it doesn’t smell like a fresh cologne like others have described. I don’t know many perfumes with pine and eucalyptus in but this isn’t what I imagined those notes to smell like.

That being said, I think that if you're looking for a really clean, fresh masculine scent that's *just* a bit more refined than most designer fragrances, this could be a good pick. Smelling this blindly without paying attention to the label, I actually initially thought that it was intended to be a women's perfume- I think it's something about the brightness of the top notes that makes it feel unisex to me, although I'm not usually a big believer in categorizing fragrances by gender in general. Overall, this is really nice, but not super unique, and I feel like you could get something similar at a cheaper price point if all you were going for was a classic cologne scent."", ""A fresh, old-school cologne with some surprising undertones I don't find listed here. Apart from the woods and citrusses (which are not very prominent on my skin) I get hazelnut a few minutes after the initial spray, and then something very creamy in the drydown, almost milky. I like the approach to masculine fragrances of this house - better than their feminine ones from what I've tried so far."", 'Lovely fresh cool and clean masculine fragrance. Eucalyptus, grapefruit, pepper, vetiver and cloves with the first three prominent and tangerine waving its hand occasionally. The initial fresh blast settles to clean and cool slightly peppery.

I completely agree, it opens nice but it dries down into generic cologne smell so it\'s a little boring imho. Edit: I will add a touch extra info after seeing other reviews. Testing side by side with Aventus I see what someone else means about this being a fougere take on it. There are definite overlaps with the fresher aspects of Aventus here, not the smokiness and fruity opening of it, although the pepper note in 1828 hints at a smokiness too. Aventus is more interesting though overall and I’ll stick with my assessment of 1828 drying down a little dull for my tastes.', ""1828 is fresh, clean, and masculine.

For the first 10 to 15 minutes, a tangerine smell mixes itself with the eucalyptus, creating a crisp and manly atmosphere perfect for the spring season. The tangerine note disappears quickly, letting the middle and base notes take center stage. 1828 changes to the base notes quite quickly. It stays herbal throughout the base stage with its pine and nutmeg notes, similar to how a forest in Oregon would smell like. Silliage is good, and longevity is about 6 hours on my skin. However, and although I appreciate how unique, masculine, and fresh this fragrance is, I feel like the nutmeg and the eucalyptus stay too constant and for far too long in the fragrance's life cycle, providing a minty mouth wash/shaving cream smell to it.

Then something strange happens after an hour: It all disappears....or so you think.  Throughout the day you get a whiff here and a whiff there; not overpowering but enough to get your attention.

When I smell 1828, I think.....the old is back in. It exemplifies a fashionable guy who knows how to dress and stay ahead of new trends. Better yet, he’s a trend setter.  Right from the start you get the citrus orange and grapefruit and pine. The bitterness of the grapefruit smoothly compliments the pine as they seem to go very well together which balances it out. There is almost a coolness that comes into play which is the eucalyptus. The pepper spices it up and the nutmeg sweetens its dry down. You're left leaving a great impression.

However, 1828 somehow manages to smell modern in spite of these associations, perhaps because it\'s a bit lighter and livelier, with upbeat citrus notes and well-balanced woods. I wouldn\'t mind owning this, and maybe when my bottle of Lorenzo Villoresi\'s excellent, ""Uomo"" runs out, I\'ll give it a shot, but for now, I\'ll just be happy to know that it\'s out there. 1828 is a solid offering from HdP and certainly worth considering if you\'re looking for something in this vein.

Though to be honest these fragrance accords are not to my taste though this would be worth sampling if you like these notes in a scent.

Elegant, masculine, fresh but not dull, with a remarkable presence but not loud...a fantastic everyday\'s fragrance...but... ...but disappointment was waiting for me just right behind the corner. The eucalyptus note evaporates in couple of minutes and you can say goodbye to the ""balsamic"" effect. Same is for the aromatic grapefruit leaving 1828 in a sort of generic territory made of vetiver, spices and woods (mainly cedar) that\'s really too similar to Gucci Envy For Men. Overall I can\'t say that 1828 is unsuccessful but after the outstanding opening I definitely expected something more.

Then something strange happens after an hour: It all disappears....or so you think.  Throughout the day you get a whiff here and a whiff there; not overpowering but enough to get your attention.

There's a certain dark sweetness that I really enjoy in here. Definitely an Auramaxing fragrance that gives a mysterious vibe vs an inviting compliment puller lol. I also agree with the previous commentor saying its versatile. Any season, any time of day, any level of professionalism. If you like it, this will work as a signature scent for that reason. It is spring biased tho. EDIT: I'm actually gonna move it down to 7/10 as a scent and 6.5/10 as a fragrance. It isn't offensive at all, but the mint note has been making me sick when I spray it. Reminds me of Guy Laroche Horizon in that punchy mint off the top. Horizon is one of my least favorite fragrances."", ""A summer sweet fragrance, very typical of Paco rabanne and smells pleasant It doesn't last as long as ultra red but if you want something sweet for the summer or the hot winter months then this is a good choice, just my humble opinion"", ""I can't wait to try this one!"", 'Ultraviolet by Rabanne for men: Somewhere, I read an interesting article about this one that really put it into perspective for me. It said something along the lines of it having the personality of a night club. It is accurate. This one isn’t as strong as I’d like it to be, but it is different. It isn’t particularly masculine. It’s very subtle. It truly reminds me of a fog machines fog..yes, They have a smell, and it’s parfumy and sweet, Rather feminine. I bought it in the fall just to try it. It’s not good for fall. I wore it a couple times and decided to hang onto it till the warmer months came, try it again and give away if I can’t make it work. Doesn’t smell bad, just not so sure it suits me.', ""* Really great update of the aromatic fougere fragrance DNA * Blends Rabanne's modern sweet/fresh DNA with their classic fougere DNA expertly * Very good blend of sweet, herbal, woody, vanilla, spicy, amber and oakmoss aromas * Cross-generational; great for both older and younger users * Refreshing scent * Not as sweet as the more popular Invictus, Phantom and 1 Million line * Good performer * Really cool bottle and sprayer mechanism * Underrated and undervalued  * Left behind in the wake of the success of the Invictus and 1 Million lines Rabanne's Ultraviolet Man is an extremely underrated gem, a blend of Rabanne's old and new. It's a hybrid fragrance that combines the modern sweet and fresh DNA Rabanne is famous for nowadays with the classic aromatic fougere DNA they were previously known for into a seamless whole.  This is a very good blend of sweet, herbal, woody, vanilla, spicy, amber and oakmoss aromas. The mint and vanilla combo may initially come off as lavender which the presentation would lead you to believe, the more the fragrance sits with you you'll realize it's not actually a floral note you're getting and the fragrance's uniqueness will stand out more. Very well done here.  This is slightly sweet, but nowhere near the levels of Phantom, Invicturs or 1 Million. It's much more subtle and allows the herbal notes to express themselves. You can clearly see the sweet and fresh DNA roots here, though, and where Rabanne went all out with them in their other fragrances.  This is great for both older and younger users, a cross-generational fragrance that will appeal to both older classic fougere lovers and younger sweet and fresh fragrance lovers equally well. Unfortunately, just like Rabanne's equally underrated XS line, Ultraviolet has been left in the dust due to the popularity of the Invictus, 1 Million and Phantom lines. This is definitely worth trying if you can find it.  Performance is good and the presentation is great. It's sleek and stylish and I like it a lot better than the Invictus, 1 Million and Phantom presentations. The spray mechanism is cool, allowing you to pump it like a handle and the atomization is great. This is a very good scent and product overall.

Has the same laundry ambergris opening as GIT, MI, and such, with a spearmint gum quality in the vein of Invictus (which, let's be honest, had kind of the same general vibe as MI going on). There's a lot more vetiver in this too than the votes would have you believe.  The heart comes with a floral aspect, thanks to lyral and geraniol and the drydown is a woody, musky, vanilla thing. The mint and ambergris never really go away though and the overall effect is rather linear. Not a bad thing at all, it's a very interesting and (likely for many) perplexing scent. It fits right into the mold of turn of the millennium fashion.  It might take a little time to wrap your head around and it won't be the perfect choice for every occasion, but we're talking about an era where a lot of perfumes took risks and tried weird things. Synthetic? You bet. So was everything from that general time period. You want natural vibes, go seek ye out some pre-80's masculines. They're as natural as they come but so few these days clamor for them. This was the start of Y2K, baby. Let's get weird with it."", ""I remember trying this while on a testing rampage in a department store. It was the first and so far only time a scent made me go: I know this, I love this, I want this, all in a matter of minutes. Still not sure why I recognized it, my best guess is a certain family member may have worn it for a while when it was new. It came after a phase where I was sometimes going for manly and bad-ass, trying some really retro scents, and this put me back on the track of just wearing what I like best and what smells plain nice to me regardless of the image it's putting across. I used to get lots of vanilla here, but more recently the same bottle smells fresher and greener to me, arguably more like the note breakdown here on Fragrantica. No idea if it's my nose or the liquid that's aging, or alternatively my reference points changing as I experience more fragrances."", ""It's pretty good, but it IS super sweet. And perhaps a bit synthetic, although I'm not sure if that word really means anything anymore.

If you like vanilla/ambery scents on the dry down this is for you!!', 'Gladly received this as a valentines day gift <3 Have been wearing it all week to work and have been enjoying it more and more every day as I learn about it in real-time. First thing that you will notice is (obviously) the box, a really cool and slick, shiny violet coloured box with an icy white/silver strip around the ""ultraviolet"" keeping things simple, futuristic and memorable! As soon as you open the box and see the bottle is a wow moment for me, I know this product is quite old yet it is probably the most innovative and original bottle in my whole collection. A long, vertical, purple trigger which works really well and is super unique to use. Lightly coloured lilac juice inside a transparent bottle.  Finally, and most importantly, the smell. The opening makes me think of the sweets known as floral gum/cherry lips and also freshly cut flowers. A sweet , sugary , almost perfume scent at first. As it begins to dry down it becomes a smoother and creamier vanilla scent. Not a beast in terms of projection but perfect for office/daily wear without annoying anyone. Pulls in compliments , and is enjoyable to smell of yourself as the day goes on.  Delighted to have this one in my arsenal.  Not to sound disrespectful to this fragrance, but is great for freshening a room also, as I have the 100ml bottle I have been spraying generously.', 'What a unique PR fragrance this one is. Designed by one of my favorite perfumers, Jacques Cavallier. And what I experience is totally subjective and different if I compare the notes mentioned above and in the reviews below with my own perception. For me Ultra Violet opens tame with a soft amber, spices and a woody vetiver. And the magic happens for me in the drydown. I smell a lovely fresh citrus with white flowers. A bit like Cologne by Dior. It’s very elegant and uplifting and mostly it is the other way around with the pattern of fresh fragrances. They start fresh and end musky, sweet or ambery. On paper it lasts a long time. On my skin the smell disappears rather quickly. So the performance is not very good. And that’s the only thing that withholds me from purchasing a full bottle of this lovely subtle synthetic but natural smelling pleaser. Edit: 3-3-22. I pulled the trigger for a 100 ml bottle. It’s one of the most peculiar frags that I own. Like a chameleon it has different patterns and experiences, from fresh to dusty sweet, spicy and sometimes I smell a synthetic powdery lavender. It changes constantly, very weird. I wonder how Ultra Violet behaves in warmer weather.', ""Pretty good fragrance, kind of reminds me of Creed's GIT in a way. Obviously it has differences in terms of quality and the overall smell, but it puts me in the same mood as GIT. Opens very green and very fresh, with a slight sweetness (but nowhere near the usual sweetness you'd expect from a PR men's fragrance). To my nose it's a pretty linear scent, as it dries down maybe I get a bit of vanilla but that's pretty much it.  This isn't a panty-dropper type of fragrance where women are going to be head over heels over the way you smell. It's pretty unique and very fresh but not sexy by any means. It's also quite synthetic and very obviously a 'perfume', as in concocted in a lab somewhere, but it's really well done so it doesn't bother me too much.  Performance is just 'meh'. Projection is okay for about an hour than gets more intimate, longevity about 4-5 hours.  Overall a solid 7.5/10. Worth a try, it's not bad by any means."", 'Unique and versatile, metallicy, earthy, wet-mossy, lively amber accords that smell innovative, fresh and quite modern. This frag is definitely worth the purchase, as the experience is indeed quite unique, with massive overall pleasantness. I can tell you to Buy Blind with confidence, as you\'ll be mesmerized by the modern opening, an ambiance of its swirls and wafts of fruity, metallic, deep earthy notes. The dry-down takes a while but remains pretty much the same, with those rich accords of moss, amber and earth filling your sillage bubble. Performance is moderate-plus as is projection, longevity and sillage, possible lasting longer in winter. It is an Eau de Toilette (cologne) strength and is fairly potent this way. An EDP would be overpowering, so EDT suits this frag. The bottle is worth a mention, with its long side-press button, its works okay but I\'d prefer a more traditional style. Overall, Ultraviolet Paco Rabanne for Men is a ""Don\'t Miss Out"" at a good price. So, smell unique for a bit.', 'Too many memories❤ very unique long-lasting fragrance. Unlike anything else. Ultraviolet the original is a safe buy ..blind buy safe.. enjoyed it a long time ago👌💜 Update: more suitable for young men 25 and less', ""PR Ultraviolet is a pleasant fragrance, not an aquatic but a fresh and sweet. PR Red is even sweeter and performance wise they are about equal. Spray on a little on your clothes and you'll get more milage with longevity & Silage.

Ultraviolet 7.5 & Red 8.0🤗❤️👍❗"", 'Blind buy for me and my initial impressions are nothing but positive! Complex and distinctive notes, gorgeous and futuristic packaging/ atomizer that match the unique scent, and just straight up addicting the more I wear it. Not to mention the great price for what you get. Signature scent worthy in my opinion. I get the comments relating this to an unopened pack of menthols but it’s in the best way possible!  Opens up a bit synthetic with a grassy, dusty, minty entrance that quickly turns smoky and peppery for me. It might be harsh at first for some of you folks but give it time to settle in cause this is where it gets addicting: The dry down steals the show for me! Here’s where it gets complex and very rich with the fresh spicy opening & heart notes phasing into a earthy, spicy vanilla that perfectly blends all the notes that have developed into a climax well worth the journey.  Not a great projector or performer, definitely more intimate. But the beauty of this one lies in the quiet, quirky, and layered development! Great addition to any collection but it’s a more mature scent at least 20s and up.', 'Vintage 2002 purple bottle vs. new 2020 clear glass bottle: No difference.  The vintage was made in France, the new is made in Spain.  Both have that fresh and slightly smoky character.  Sour berries, metallic lavender and a little bit of mint.  The whole fragrance concept is futuristic. It’s not the purple smell when you think of plum, it’s more a dark berry metallic fresh smell. Similar to Bond No. 9 Bleecker Street, which is a blueberry fragrance.', ""I think my view of Ultraviolet echoes that of many others. This fragrance is actually really pleasant. It's fairly unique, but also mass appealing- kind of what the house of Creed do (niche but more accessible fragrances). Ultraviolet feels like it has the ambergris vibes of Creed and the bubblegum of Paco Rabanne. It's slightly unique, but also mass appealing too. Unfortunately, the batch I have is weak which also makes it less desirable to use. So all in all, it's lovely but just not a wow and also lacks performance."", ""It is a nice scent, Elegant, Warm, Vanilla and Sweet. A bit synthetic, but it smells so good with reasonable price. Paco Rabanne launched it in 2001 before Bleecker Street and Purple Label. It opens up with like sweet fresh spicy and green notes in the background then dry down is sweet vanilla ambery.

It is testament to the Paco Rabanne brand when it comes fragrances - they don't disappoint.  I get the fresh and minty top note. The spicy middle notes and vanilla also come through after a while, along with the hint of wood... it must be the vetiver.  Like 1 Million, I would say that this fragrance has a youth vibe; generally guys in their 20s and 30s can safely wear it. Ultraviolet Man is safe enough to wear in any season, to any place and occasion and at any time of day. Like 212 Man by Carolina Herera, this fragrance is a safe go to fragrance.

First of all, it's my second bottle, by that I mean it's one of my favorite fragrances by Paco Rabanne, if not, THE first Paco Rabanne fragrance I ever owned and the first bottle I had, was back in early 2000's, while in high school. So, with that said, if this perfume got reformulated, I really can't tell the difference. It smells the same fresh synthetic scent of amber and mint and other green aromas, just like back in 2000's. It has the same longevity (9 to10 hours on my skin) and saddly Paco Rabanne didn't tweeked much the projection, so people won't notice much, unless they're in close range with you. Basically, it's one of those fragrances you want to wear when you're one of those weekend escapades at the ocean, during spring/summer with your loved one or use it for evening events in house of friends. Also I'd like to add that I really enjoy the bottle, I get the idea of reseambling a UV lamp, but when it comes to applying the perfume, makes me remind of those sci-fi pneumatic syringes from total recall.

El acorde de ámbar también está bastante bien hecho, no chillón o demasiado fuerte, manteniendo las cosas juntas y dando una buena base al aroma. ¿Es esta mezcla sintética? ¡Absolutamente! ¿Es equilibrada y agradable de llevar? ¡Sin dudas!

This is a male scent (the mint is the note that points it out) but it smells lovely on my skin: sweeter and not so minty, more amber and vanilla and in the drydown mixed spices. Lovely!

I should also join others in saying the original formulation of BLV was one of the best fragrances from Alberto Morillas. Now I can\'t detect any ginger in it. Very less of sandalwood too, both of which were the very foundation of the original. Newer versions are very powdery and extremely similar to the ""Burberry Touch"" which i dislike due to its ""Nycil"" prickly heat powder smell.

Bvlgari obviously had a different idea of what colour 'blue' smells like. It's not the Vicks Vapour rub camphor type smell that is usually associated with this colour.

Unlike most fragrances, it doesn't use citrus for freshness, rather - it uses ginger, but retains no spiciness - the base is like baby powder, the sum total effect is very simple and clean.

Maybe it wasn’t the same frag. When we got home I sprayed 2 half pumps. Yay!! Hello my old friend!!! There it was the scent I remembered and never forgot.

I couldn’t believe how much it was projecting off of me three hours later and all I was doing was just sitting there. So be warned: DO NOT overspray. The meek opening is a trick. Even with just three to four sprays it can be overwhelming as it dries down. Fantastic bottle as well. A wonderful and unique offering from Bvlgari.', ""I had this many moons ago, and I bought a full bottle just for the nostalgia, and also because I found a great deal online.

I could have sworn there's peppercorn in it. But my new bottle does not irritate my nose as much on the initial spray. So I'm not sure if there's been a reformulation?!

A good office scent, i believe.', 'Bvlgari Blv Pour Homme Cologne opens with a soft projection of sweet, spicy, woody, green, and floral notes. The opening is soft, the notes are dull and most of them come up with equal intensity. The sandalwood is noticeable just as a sweet opening note; the cardamom, ginger, and tobacco blossom are the next prominent notes, a mix of a spicy and white floral accord, sharp, fresh, slightly bitter. The teak wood, juniper, and green leaves add also some touches. Bvlgari Blv is an interesting fragrance, all notes come up as featured notes, the fragrance projects equally, however, they are dull, as opposed to crisp and easily recognizable. Once Bvlgari Blv Pour Homme Cologne Men EDT has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a soft projection, slightly sweet, spicy, woody, green, and white floral fragrance. The fragrance feels faint, fresh, gentle, green, moderate-quality, modern, resinous, sweet, unisex, versatile, weak, woody, and pleasant. BATCH REVIEWED: 2020. WOW RATING: 5/10. An unimpressive, average, but pleasant fragrance floral (tobacco blossom), spicy, woody, and fresh green notes. DISLIKE RATING: 0/10. The fragrance contains no offensive notes. UNIQUENESS: 6/10. Common notes, but relatively average scent. MASS APPEAL: 6/10. Most people will find this fragrance OK but not great. PROJECTION: 3/10. Moderate to low, about 3 feet, it feels soft. SILLAGE: 3/10. Moderate to low, 3 or fewer feet, about arm’s length. APPLICATION: 6 atomizations. LONGEVITY: 3/10. Low, about 3 hours, it projects for less than 1 hour. SEASONS: Spring, summer. OCCASIONS: Formal events, outdoor gatherings, office, business, casual, holidays, vacations. This is an office-friendly fragrance.  VERSATILITY: 5/10. A soft fragrance, and better suited for mild or warm weather but not sports. GENDER: Unisex, the slight green note creates a masculine touch but the white floral accord creates a feminine touch. AGES: Any. RECOMMENDATION: Bvlgari Blv Pour Homme Cologne Men EDT can be purchased for about $50, it is a pleasant fragrance blending multiples notes into a fresh and casual scent but its projection and longevity are very poor. It is a nice-to-have, but not a must-have. BLIND-BUY: Yes, but only if you are familiar with its main notes. Also, consider its poor performance. SIMILAR: These are examples of green fragrances. Alfred Dunhill Pursuit Men EDT is a green note and woody cedar and spicy fragrance; Costume National Cyber Garden is a soft green, and woody fragrance, poor performance; Jacques Bogart Story Green is an affordable green and woody fragrance. SUMMARY: A soft projection, slightly sweet, spicy, woody, green, and white floral fragrance. The fragrance feels faint, fresh, gentle, green, moderate-quality, modern, resinous, sweet, unisex, versatile, weak, woody, and pleasant.', 'One of the best and safest perfumes to wear, for all seasons, day and night, any occasion except partying and clubbing and wedding..', 'I had a large bottle of this when it was new, I was never convinced, it was very generic and even unisex', 'Plain, simple, good.', 'I get the similarities with Prada Amber.

Gave it to a friend without thinking twice. Ran into it again at Stein mart and decided to give it another chance. Definitely smells better than I remember and does have something that makes it stand out a little more from the rest of the other standard men's aquatic scents, probably the ginger. Unfortunately it just doesn't last long at all. It's a shame because it is a pleasant scent but I don't think I'll be keeping it around or just carry it around to reapply all day."", 'I was surprised on first sniff. Soapy, powdery fragrance. Baby powder is a close representation. Not at all blue as I was expecting from the design. I don’t know why I was expecting a more vibrant masculine fragrance. Maybe it was the name and bottle design that had me expecting an ozonic, zesty aroma. Testing from sample so can’t comment on longevity.', ""At first I get a fresh soapy scent. This is very light and very safe. This is like a nice soapy scent and what you get I assume is the galanga and the ginger and those two along with the green notes give you that soapy feel. The projection can be increased if more sprays are applied but it is a moderate scent and also I get maybe 7-8 hours on clothes. Later on you get almost an oily or perfume aura along with the soapiness but this gives the scent a richness while wearing it. I definitely think this is unisex also. This could go in a feminine direction and it's very clean and casual. This is a perfect work scent. I also get a slight ocean vibe in this as well and the bottle is very nice looking. The bottle is an eye catcher on any shelf or your dresser. I give this a 83/100."", 'I smell no Ginger at all. A fresh soapy fragrance with green notes. Why they names it Blv is beyond me.

After years of having this on my buy list I finally bought a bottle earlier this summer and been wearing several times weekly all summer long. Absolutely love it! It's fresh and clean and yet unique. I was pleased to learn its not another boring shower gel scent. It's more of a soapy fresh than a citrus fresh. If that makes sense. Smells like freshly washed clothes but in a classy way like expensive hotel soap or Italian shaving cream. I get decent performance too which surprised me because my skin eats up fresh scents. It's now a summer staple in my rotation and will probably be for a long time to come."", 'Good but not exciting.', ""@Dirtyhoody I strongly agree with you, because I purchased it 3 years ago and the performance was horrible on my dry skin, so I convinced a friend of mine to try it and he has a normal skin, once again the performance was a thumbs down.. he said that it became a skin scent after 1 hour or 2 hours..

Smells very clean, like you've just stepped out of the shower. and this feeling last for a very long time thanks for the musk notes in it.

This feels like a winter fragrance, it could definitely pierce through the cold. Those saying the performance is bad, are incorrect.

Beautiful scent that unfortunately is not suitable for me."", ""The smell upon application is fresh , clean and soapy, but the biggest problem is there absolutely 0 sillage and 0 longevity.

I'll update my reviews about my experiences and if you're someone like me, maybe it'll help you make better financial decisions Haha! Happy Sniffing! Blv was not a quick buy. I kept sniffing this at my local retailer before finally purchasing it. There is something about this that I really like. It's not overly masculine, and has a very subtle spicy and warm nature. I cant really pin point notes in it though. The ginger, cardamom and other spices are not distinctly noticeable to my nose but all lend a spirited spiciness to the over tone. The downside of that is it does smell quite perfume-ish to me with a nondescript scent. I wish the green notes were stronger - that would have made this more interesting I think. Blv is fairly strong for the first 2 to 3 hours and then becomes softer and lasts for about 5 to 6 hours. Doesn't change much from wet to dry. I like how this smells on clothes - very warm and comforting. I have received compliments on this one. Great office scent because it is not offensive at all, and you can lather it without worrying about offending anyone. UPDATE Today I finished my last spritz of Blv - I've enjoyed wearing it but don't think I will repurchase. a good one time buy. Loved the bottle so hated that I had to junk it."", ""It's safe almost too safe. Not one thing about this stirs the senses. Maybe that's just what you're looking for out of a fragrance for work and that's totally fine. But to me, BLV could be The Office's own, Toby Flenderson of fragrances. Pleasant, does the job he's supposed to, but lacking any trace of balls or memorability. Will get squashed by any other fragrance in the area. But maybe it's better than nothing. Your choice. Wouldn't reccomend to young guys looking for a powdery scent, in that case I can't think of any better suiting than Burberry Touch"", 'Smells like a dove soap.

Because this is what this one smells like, notwithstanding the notes: A bar of soap that was under the water not so long ago. Not the super expensive fancy bar you buy in a high-end cosmetic store nor the cheap one at the Dollar-store, but rather the popular brand at your grocery store. But with the very low price it can be found for, online at least, it’s worth it to me. In my opinion it smells like the perfumer wanted to create a bar of soap made with YSL L’Homme’s top, with the semi-fresh spicy ginger, and surrounded by the base of a ""lemonless"" Chanel Allure Edition Blanche or even Frapin’s L’Humaniste with a creamy but dry/a bit sharp sandalwood/vanilla combo with a slightly wet, green aura added to it.  If the more popular Prada Amber is too powdery, resinous or sweet for you but want something in the same vein, Bvlgari’s fragrance might be your huckleberry. Give it a shot. I enjoy it quite a lot more than other soapy/clean cheap popular designer releases such as Mugler Cologne or Nautica Voyage. Based on the way it smells, its longevity on me combined with its unobtrusive projection, it’d make a perfect office scent.', ""When I was in junior high, I was gifted a Deo Stick variant of this by my father. For some reason it had none of the top notes of the EdT - all it had was the dry down. That was HEAVENLY. I was not as impressed with the EdT when I revisited it 10 years later as I didn't like the Cardamom-y opening at all. That said, I still enjoyed the Gingery dry down very much."", ""The person below me said it smelled like clean sheets which I thought was an odd way of describing a scent, but I just tried Blv and it's a spot on description. It really does smell like fresh linen. It's soft, safe, comforting, and pleasant. I often like to wear a fragrance to bed and this will be perfect."", 'I massively misunderstood this when I first started wearin’ it. All I got was clean bed sheets from it. Which ain’t to say that’s bad, it’s quite nice. Everyone likes clean bed sheets, especially when the sheets in question ain’t yours.  Sorry. Tangent. Anyway. Fragrance.  It weren’t until months later when it reentered me rotation that I started pickin’ up on the ginger. Now I dunno how I went so long not gettin’ it.

I consider it casual even though it’s probably too classy for that because it just smells to me like it belongs on someone in jeans an’ a tee relaxin’ and enjoyin’ ‘emselves.

It’s WELL WORTH that.', 'You ever been around a raging alcoholic that is sweating from it being hot outside and you can smell the alcohol coming through there pours? That’s what this smell like. Very disappointed with this one from Bvlgari. Bottle was given away.', 'dentist room', 'i just got it today as gift pack include shower gel.shave balm .... realy nice woody fresh spicy fragrance', ""As usual per Bvlgari, it can't be anything common. This smells as if a fresh cold windy day somehow ended up in a bottle of champaigne and brought along a few clouds, who are a bit confused as to what on earth are they doing there. It has this fresh, airy fizziness that can be read as powderiness, but it ain't powder, its kind of, well, cloud bubbles would be the best way to describe it. Quite unique as a fragrance and well worth trying and even blind buying, as it is almost impossible not to like at least something in it.  Also, as the name implies, this smells blue, but not the Bleu de Chanel dark, blues, blue but a vivid, almost turqoise blue. It's for the spring mostly, but can be used during the fall, and, maybe, just maybe, in summer but I think it'll come across as a bit too heavy when the temperature rises above 30 C°. If there is a downside to it, it's the linearity, as that's Bvlgari's Achilles heel that they never seem to overcome. I'm starting to think that they are doing that on purpose, as a trademark, and in all honesty their products are, mostly, so good out of the box (bottle) that it kind of makes sense. Lasts some 6 to 8 hours, projects decently but not fantasticaly for some two of them and leaves a nice sillage, even if not for too long. A strong B, tedering on an A, but not quite there because of the rather dissapointing Notte flanker."", ""I wore this to my college class and my friends told me I smell like a ginger soap like a Dial soap.

It's an unfortunate but inevitable association for me, so it's a pass."", ""Fresh, powdery, clean laundry with citrus undertones....that's the dominant scent I get on me. I like this scent, it's not over the top. I see myself wearing this as a spring frangrance during the day, and on cooler summer days. Maybe a little too strong in the high temp days of an Australian summer....but we'll see.  Nothing sophisticated so the perfect casual scent."", ""Nothing beats a man that smells fresh, powdery and clean! And this one ticks all the boxes. I repeat, it won't make you smell macho, or a playa, or smooth or whatever adjectives millennials can think of describing a playboy or whatnot. Hahah.. No booboo, stay clear from this one. However, if you are the kind of man who's confident of your sexuality and masculinity even without wearing a suit, a Rolex and a Tom Ford por Homme perfumes, this is the perfume you need. Clean, fresh, powdery, inoffensive. Nope, SAFE is not the word. Safe is equals to boring! This is Clean, Fresh and Powdery. I ran out of adjectives meself but then again, those 3 are enough/ Go and be real man. :)"", ""Ah it's summer and you've got nose fatigue or a real lack of inspiration from all your citrus based fragrances. What do you do? Well, if the zing of ginger is something that you find refreshing then say no more Bvlgari BLV has you covered! BLV has become one of my all time favorite summer fragrances. BLV is a real pleasure to wear and congers up memories of lounging pool side and staring straight at a clear blue sky. The opening of BLV is pure gingery powder with a touch of cardamom and a very sweet tobacco blossom. BLV besides having a fizzy ginger element, also has this really faint juniper note that I feel forms the foil to the ginger in this scent, creating a near perfect balance between the ginger and powdery essence of this scent. The teakwood and sandalwood come in to give the scent a warm, rich woody base. BLV as a whole is a beauty of a warm weather scent, with its' light florals, woods and fresh, spicy ginger. The notes are well separated and are not at all cloying. BLV feels clean powdery and fresh and is really something different to wear on a sunny, warm day. BLV can be worn by the twenty year old crowd all the way to the late thirties crowd. This fragrance has longevity so it works well during the day and would work well in the office. BLV as I have stated is a warmer weather fragrance and works great in spring and summer. Bvlgari BLV is another reasonably priced scent from a real quality house, so for me it is full bottle worthy. BLV is the scent you wear when you were just swimming and tanning by the pool and you still want to relive that relaxing moment on your skin and in your nose. Give BLV a few sprays when you just swam a few lengths, tanned, showered off the Banana Boat and are ready to relax on your porch or balcony for the rest of the day before meeting up with friends for a bbq."", 'Powderly formal, it smells like baby powder with a masculine edge.', ""I've had this one for awhile now and I never gave it a fair shake. It grew on me. Especially being so hot, not having to wear something aquatic or citrus is a bonus. It opens a bit soapy and sharp like a lot of soapy scents do. However, about 20 minutes in the cardamom and sandalwood really come out. I never really lose the cardamom but the flowery aspects of the composition start to show themselves after a few hours. It remains more fresh than floral though. I got about 7-8 hours out of it with moderate sillage. For the price tag, I would consider that a good buy. This one could be used for all occasions and by most age groups, possibly even women. It's quite inoffensive and pleasant to the nose."", ""This one smells ...I can't say it smells like an old grandfather. Sorry BLV. It's too spicy and overly masculine in my eye. There is no any single note that I can like in the fluid. It's too far away from me. Sorry... I like most of BLV women fragrances, and I am aiming to find one among their for men, but sorry not this one."", ""I do generally enjoy powdery-sweet scents, but in this one there is some note (or accord) that smells very much like honey - and it's quite powerful. Not being familiar with tobacco blossom or galangal I have to wonder if it's one of these? Owing to my status as a Bvlgari slut, I was surprised not to be a huge fan of this, but that honey-like accord just went a little too funky on me (maybe a little closer to over-ripe fruit?). Oh well, we can't be a good match for them all :)"", ""Me & my brother fell in love with this fragrance in the early 2000's & we both wore it for years.With life changes i totally forgot about it after about five years or so.Hadn't smelled it in a couple years & the other day my brother bought a new bottle only to realize that it's a shell of it's former self.So sad cause this was amazing & ahead of it's time"", ""I get lemongrass, a cool creamy base like face makeup or body lotion and the faintest hint of spice.

That allowed me to test all five fragrances quite a bit. Initial shot is unpleasant. Bvlgari may call that “aromatic”, but to me, it was just yuk! After dry down it has a soapy and powdery scent. Longevity and projection are on the low end of moderate. I do not recommend. Sorry, but for me this is a dis-like. This was the worst of the five Bvlgari fragrances in my mini-bottle collection. My ranking of the five mini bottle collection of Bvlgari fragrances is: 1 – Man in Black EDP, 2 – Man Extreme, 3 – Aqua Amara, 4 – Aqua Pour Homme, and 5 – BVL Pour Homme.', 'bought this as advised by my female staff... after shower at 8PM, i went out for groceries, and after returned home..my wife said am (sill) smell soo fresh and she loves the powdery and soapy sensation..

Starts off with that fresh manly frag smell, then it's soft and comforting, rounded and inviting. I did wonder if it was akin to what the older generations of men wore, or wear now, but I think they are having a bit of a resurgence. If you don't have a rounded, powdery, citrus fresh sort, worth s look in. My sample is just s little splash, so I'm not getting the full ampage that a spray would give.

Really subtle but noticeable and a real compliment getter. Can pick it up for a very reasonable price (£40 for 100ml)And I would pay a lot more if necessary. LOVE IT!', 'I bought this fragrance based on the fact that Alberto Morillas was the perfumer behind it. I was not disappointed. I enjoy smelling this fragrance. It is a very ""soft"" and smooth scent that is truly addicting. The smell is linear for the most part, but it is very well-blended. Every time I smell this cologne the word ""smooth"" comes to mind. Also, even though the note is not listed on there, to me this cologne has a ""lemony"" vibe to it. However, when I pay attention to the scent I can smell the ginger and cardamom in it as these are the two notes that stand out the most. To me, this cologne seems to fit more of a ""khakis and button-up shirt"" look and I tend to dress more casual or athletic so it is safe to say that I have not had the chance to wear this out in public. However, I will be giving it a go soon to see how it works for me. As of right now, I would give this cologne the following ratings: Scent: 4.0/5 Sillage: 3.0/5 Longevity: 3.5/5 Value: 4.0/5 Overall: 3.6/5', 'I love this scent and wear it daily. Its none intrusive and i wear just one spray on the upper chest under work attire (i work in an office so i cannot be too offensive).

It reminds me so much of Chanel's Allure Edition Blanche, minus the citrus, so if you liked that one's creamy-smooth base, you'll probably love this. There's nothing stereotypically masculine about it, which is fine, but it's a bit *too* smooth and sweet for my taste, with nothing to cut the sweetness. I don't dislike it - it's simple and comforting - but I think I'll be sticking to Prada's Amber pour Homme for my go-to soapy smell."", ""Scent & Qualiy: 8/10 Longevity: 8/10 Sillage: 8/10 Creativity & Uniqueness: 8/10 Affordability: 9/10 My Overall score: 8,2/10 i love this fragrance since last ten years..

This would layer very nicely with Montblanc Presence to add some greener notes.  It is fairly linear and has a warmer smelling drydown then Prada Amber so if you want a cleaner ""safe"" scent that doesn\'t fill a room, I can easily suggest this for cooler months as an office scent as it stands up well.

Well, I find that it lasts for more than 12 hours on me and that it works in any kind of weather. The projection is strong but subtle. There is always a wonderful gentle waft of Blv in the shower the following morning (I spray a little in my hair) as the metaphorical magic carpet flies away at the break of a new day. The main note is ginger but not in a way that you would expect. Blv settles into a lovely mix of green notes within a lovely warm, woody base and a little galanga and jasmine mixing with the ginger.  This one is just pure class. Subtle, warm and elegant, multilayered and so damned good! I have worn this almost since it came out about fourteen years ago and it was my favourite then and it remains my favourite now, dozens of perfumes later. Alas, I was lulled into a false sense of security by the presence of Blv Pour Homme on the Bvlgari website.

This is a ""dry"" feeling, clean, and fresh cologne that is great for hot days. The ginger is strong and gives off a scent that is similiar to lemon. The scent may be considered a bit too fresh, with powerful flower and powdery notes, much of them resembling baby powder. That can cause it to smell much more on the feminine side of things. This could possibly be used in the work environment / meeting new people but only if used sparingly. Overapplication can induce headaches and overpower the surrounding area quite easily. All that said it is still kind of a simple fragrance, if you are used to more complicated ones this will be boring to you.

The ginger component was obvious once I knew to look for it but otherwise I think all the notes work together to create one smooth, harmonious experience.  It seems like a mostly linear scent and once it settles down on your skin, what you smell is mostly what you get. This easily lasts 8 hours on me and can linger much longer as a skin scent or on clothing. I think BLV is flexible enough for most any occasion and any season. Though, personally, I’m most drawn to wear it during Winter and Spring. It inspired me to try other Bvlgari fragrances but remains one of my favorites, along with Bvlgari Pour Homme Soir, Black, and Aqva.', ""Just got my second bottle. This is unique long lasting and fabulous. Lovely ginger, tobacco and spices. As I said below, it's yummy! Bvlgari and Alberto are quality. In my all time top ten."", ""Blv was among the first fragrances that I bought, which was back in college. Got it from Macy's for around $70 (3.4oz EdT, 3.4oz after shave and a small tube of shower gel). Very clean and fresh scent. Quite common though. I use it for layering only. Scent 8.5/10 Sillage 9/10 Projection 9/10 Longevity 8/10"", ""I find it a bit crazy to admit that it took me nearly three years to appreciate the kind of gem this perfume is. It's not the one that makes me feel peppy and uplifted. Instead, i find it rather smooth and intriguing. Also, it doesn't change much in character from the opening through the drydown. Longevity is great -- beyond 12 hours on my skin -- and it stays close to the skin after about eight hours."", 'Very soapy clean fresh and little sweet. Too strong for me but I like it.', 'It\'s a good aromatic cologne after shower in the summer or spring time. The aromatic ginger and galanga note are outstanding. It smell clean,fresh,herbal, masculine and soapy.  I have notice that the fragrance oil in BLV pour Homme has been use in many Detergent and cosmetics product. I have ""Avon Baby Calminig Lavender Lotion"" and it smells exactly like this cologne. For the sillage and longeivity is quite weak on my skin.', 'This is a delicious scent! BLV Pour Homme opens with a burst of ginger and fresh cardamom notes. Then, the tobacco appears and says: ""I\'m here to make you elegant, without disturbing"". And to close the door with a golden key, we have a delicious and balanced mix of sandalwood with vetiver, in the base. The result is a fresh fragrance, which remains linear on the skin, changing almost nothing as it evolves. The final sensation is elegant, comfortable and with a hint of the ""powdery"" of baby colognes. The durability is excellent on my skin, with medium projection, which I attribute as a characteristic of the perfumes of the brand, which value for elegance. BLV Pour Homme is great for use on hotter days, including at work.', ""My signature scent for sure. 12 years of it and still going.. It's just an amazing perfume! The opening, the soapy drydown... God bless you Alberto Morillas and Bvlgari for creating this one."", ""Just got my second bottle. This is unique long lasting and fabulous. Lovely ginger, tobacco and spices.

I really am blown away by how amazing...but different they all are. Each and every one of them. This fragrance...smells soapy...but like EXPENSIVE...smooth...masculine...almost a relaxing type of clean. I could see someone get a whiff of this by someone walking by them and just closing their eyes, and breathing in deeply. It\'s very smooth and warm. I never smelled a ""warm"" soapy scent before. But this is it! And it\'s beautifully done! As I\'ve stated in other reviews...even among my fragrances that I absolutely love...I can still easily admit when one of my most loved fragrances are absolutely NOT a good candidate for a blind buy. This is not one of those...this one is among the safest of the safe to blind buy! I cannot imagine ANYONE not at least giving this fragrance a ""like"" and it is an easy love for me.

Yes, the whole day cause I apply 5 aprays in the morning 6 a.m. and when 11 p.m. in the pub when i still dancing and flirting girls.  She ask me : Which perfume did you wear ? I said : BLV, Why ?

Yes.', ""I have to be honest and say I hate to write a bad review; I feel as though there isn't much point to explaining why someone doesn't like something, when there are plenty of people who DO like it. I mean, why rain on anyone's parade? Unfortunately Blv pour Homme fits into this category. I tried some on at a department store counter the other night and was really happy with the opening. It's very bright and gingery: I like openings that are fresh and almost giggly that like. It creates some excitement and allure, kind of like getting ready to go out on a Friday night. I'm not sure what happened, but about 15 minutes later when the top notes were gone, I really didn't like the middle or dry down. The scent was very clingy and wouldn't go away quietly. There is an artificial element in there, or maybe the cedar was too strong, but it really didn't like what was happening on my skin. Later that evening the smell had degenerated to something like vinyl and powder. It's a shame, too, because the opening IS nice and holds a lot of promise. I think it might also be the fact that Bvlgari scents as a rule don't seem to do well on my skin. I keep giving them a second chance to see if I've changed at all, but maybe we're just not a good match."", 'I smell no Ginger at all. A fresh soapy fragrance with green notes. Why they names it Blv is beyond me. It is a very light and safe fragrance that is appropriate for any occasion. The scent is nice, but I will never wear it as I can get it from any old bar of soap. Nevertheless, it does smell okay. 6 hours longevity and mild sillage.', 'Smells like a powder but quite unique though.', 'This was a gift from a friend. Originally I was apprehensive and let it sit on my shelf for a few years, but one day I decided to give it a try and so many people asked me what I was wearing. I got many compliments.

It was a cinnamon fresh fragrance with a woody base, the opening had a cooling minty note, I really liked it.

Presence is my 2nd favorite to Individuel, and it\'s closing the gap the more I wear it. I opens with a minty shaving cream smell. After a few minutes, I get mild cinnamon and some vanilla that hangs around for the next several hours. It leans synthetic... but I like synthetic when done right. The performance is somewhere in the 6 hour range. It doesn\'t blast off of my skin at any point, nor is it a weak skin scent. I dont think it would last as long without the cinnamon, but who knows? This has all-purpose, daily wear potential, where you want to smell nice, but understated. It\'s somehow unique and familiar at the same time. The best way I can describe it: modernized Old Spice vibes. Don\'t expect this fragrance, like any other, to magically drop the drawers. However, Presence is definitely a conversation starter if you\'re a well put together guy. If you rocked this as a daily scent, you will likely be told at some point ""you smell nice""... even if it\'s to yourself in your own head.', ""I seem to smell this very differently from many others. It's not spicy at all to me and I don't really pick up any cinnamon. I get a mostly floral soapy accord that's old fashioned (not a bad thing) and veers a bit too close to old lady vibes (a bad thing) especially as it dries down to a more powdery place. It was inexpensive thankfully, and that's about the best thing I can say about it. Not very masculine and not my cup of tea."", ""Someone said this is Cinnamon Gillette shaving foam and it's spot on!

Now and then is more wearable though I won't buy again when it's gone!"", 'Just a bit of sweetness, a tad bit of spice, and a touch of citrus. Nothing offensive here. To me, I get a bit of a classic barbershop vibe with this one. Like someone previously stated, ""gentlemanly"".', ""I have recently brought this back into my collection, admittedly because of the bargain price. I agree with the assessment of many who say there is something discordant in the mix. The scent is not weird, just different. My nose initially smells something lovely, fresh and sweet; but my mind tells me it detects something that just does not blend harmoniously. Others have stated it is the cinnamon, and I think that's it. It vaguely reminds me of Obsession because of the spice insinuation. The dry down is fresh, sweet and lovely, I must admit. I am really confused about my feelings toward this one.  It is a bit cloying and lasts forever. I would not recommend this as a blind buy. Spray it on first, definitely."", 'Nice cinnamon apple aftershave kind of vibe. Personal scent, very gentleman scent. I am kind of bored wearing blue and in trend scents. This may not be a ground breaking scent but smells different in its own way.', ""This fragrance was a gift and was my introduction to the world of perfumes, mostly because of the cinnamon, which I really enjoy. The best thing about it is that it smells quite different from others—or at least it has its own distinctive profile. It’s not too aggressive, not too sweet—pretty well balanced. It opens with a spicy kick and then transitions into a more floral-citrus identity, blended with woody undertones. For me, it’s amazing that it lasts around five hours in a hot, dry climate (which is common for floral, citrus, and natural fragrances—meaning it likely contains high-quality ingredients). It also has a moderate sillage, making it non-invasive for those around you. However, if you're looking for something bolder, louder, more traditionally ‘masculine,’ or mainstream, this might not be for you. That being said, always wear what you love!

It reminds more of a genre of fragrances vs any one specific cologne, and yes, I said ""Cologne"" because again, Montblanc Presence is quite Gentlemanly thus leaning more masculine imo. I suppose this would be a classic ""Oriental Spicey"" cologne. Smells of quality and very pleasant. Great for anything from Office, maybe going Golfing, lounging, Church and yeah, pretty much anything any time of the year. Again, Uber Versitile 😉. Performance is moderate to good, about 6 to 7 hours on skin (much longer on clothes), but not monstrous projection or anything. Great addition to my collection as I was missing a nice, Classic, ""Barber Shop like"" fragrance, plus I\'ve been trying to collect as many Montblanc frags as I can get my hands on, so it worked out great. Also, this smells pretty nice in the opening, but gets even better and more unique smelling during the dry down. Becomes Musky/Soapy/Spicey and I LOVE those Classic/Clean dna\'s.

Maybe I do get some ginger now that I'm looking for it, but I wouldn't have found it independently 1 Hour Later - Full on baby powder. I feel like I'm bending over a toddler crib. Still floral. Maybe rose? Guessing the sweetness is coming from apple. I don't know how heliotrope smells, but that and sage must be the source of the floridity. Base has a cornucopia of accords, sandalwood, teak wood, white musk, amber and tonka bean, none of which shine through individually I can't isolate the wood or musk at all. Maybe they're slight, or maybe they are blending with the floral notes to give the powdery emanation Overall - While I enjoy delicate, nuanced fragrances (and this is certainly that), floral & powdery scents resonate as feminine to me.

The cinnamon here is forward in the opening but moves to the background as it dries down. Contrast to Presence d'une femme MontBlanc: These are very different, but they have a similar DNA with the spicy cashmere woods. Presence d'Une Femme has an additional fruitiness that smells pineapple-y in comparison, and floral touches from cyclamen. The longer they're on the skin, the more similar they become. Contrast to English Laundry Signature for Men: Very different, but similar in their resemblance of Le Male Jean Paul Gaultier. ELSfM has lavender instead of cinnamon.  Contrast to John Varvatos John Varvatos: Different scent but with a similar vibe. Both have that fluffy, powdery wood. JV has a slight additional sweetness from dates.

Not in the ""self-effacing"" sense, but in the ""charismatic in his benevolence"" sense. A protective virility.

It opens with strong tonka and musk notes and behind those are some spicy notes, cinnamon, cardamom and a little ginger begins to peak through as the fragrance begins to settle. During the dry-down the spices become more prominent and the tonka and musk move to the background. In the later dry-down the fragrance becomes more floral and the nice spices are still there. I do get some barbershop vibes from Presence but I would say that it is more of a sweet oriental masculine fragrance. I like the scent trajectory and the spices are blended well with the early sweet and later floral notes. Mont Blanc Presence is very wearable, it is not overpowering or overtly sensual and so is suitable for most occasions. It has a nice clean vibe to it and I think it can be worn both at work or in casual settings.

It reminds me of my school bus driver from back in the day, Mid 90s. I like it. I don't love it. I did spray it on one arm about 5 hours ago and I still smell it, and get whiffs as I walk around the house. It is very much a sweet shaving cream type smell. Its not bad. I think longevity on my skin will be decent. I do not think I can pull this off in the heat though. Might be overpowering. To me, this is a fall and winter scent."", ""I'm not a fan of this really, not that it smells bad but just isn't much as a fragrance. It really does smell like shaving foam, but nice smelling shaving foam. It's something I'd enjoy for a short period, just not as an all day scent.  I'm also not generally a fan of layering, but I did recently start to layer frags that I don't really care for like this one, and I layered it today with Acqua di Parma Colonia. I like ADPC by itself for sure, but it's a pretty simple citrusy profile and thought that it may be ok for layering with this one, and it smells freaking great! The Presence just adds a perfect amount of contrast to it.  I don't know how well it performs really in general as a combo, but seemed to perform at moderate, maybe a little less, but I was pretty active outside today so hard to say if that's a good norm for it. Anywho, just throwing that out there. I'm actually looking forward to trying it again to see if I like it long term, but would probably just do it on a casual day, at work or gym. I don't feel like I created some sort of masterpiece or anything like that."", ""Gentlemen, this perfume is really good. Barbershop atmosphere, reminder of an expensive shaving cream. Sweet but masculine. I can wear it everywhere, any time. If you like Brut original you are going to like this too. (Not same perfume, just same style). People declare that it's outdated. Why? Who can say this? Who decides which perfume is outdated or not? The main question that we should make to ourselves is: DO I LIKE IT? Guys, we must all take into consideration that ladies appreciate masculine perfumes on us."", ""A perfect layering scent . I layer this with Replica At the Barbershop and Zara's Till Sunrise. It smells amazing."", ""That's a nice barbershop fragrance. Good longevity and projection on light type skins. 8/10"", ""This smells really good. Warm spicy, cinnamon & vanilla. Shaving cream kind of scent. I like it a lot. I didn't at first, but its really grown on me. I just wish it had better performance, 2-4 hours and its gone."", 'I enjoy this fragrance. Apple cinnamon warmth with shaving cream. My wife told me it smells like baby powder to her. I wear it to work every now and then. If you see it at a rack store take a chance. You will only be out $20 if you don’t like it.', 'Not bad , but honestly only real occasion to wear this is if after you shave you wanna prolong that smell throughout the day this comes across as a strong manly barbasol shave cream. Longevity and projection are also quite impressive. Presentation is very nice and won’t break the bank don’t pay over 25$ for this.', ""What I get from this is a lighter version of Le Male off the top. Once it dries down the similarity ends and it's more like a fresh clean scent (barbershop, as everyone is saying below). I don't get warm spicy from this at all. This one is unique to me as a fresh scent that isn't citrus dominant like they usually are. This relies on the ginger, cinnamon, apple and tonka (instead of vanilla) to give it that bright, clean feel. I can sense the cardamom in there clearly. This is a great fragrance for casual or at the office, as it's a clean scent with a touch of sweetness that doesn't project too much. Decent performance. I got a tester for $20 online and I'm glad I did. I'd rate this a solid 8/10 overall."", ""I own over 100 fragrances and I don't have anything that smells like this. Looks like mouthwash and smells a bit like it too, but in a nice way. It's hard to find something both different & pleasant when you own a lot of fragrances, but this fresh & spicy cologne pulls it off. If I had to compare it to a fragrance think of a lighter, fresher Le Male with a spicy twist. Longevity isn't as bad as I thought it would be - an average edt - but it doesn't project much. It's suitable for the office and for springtime. If the above description sounds appealing, don't pay more than $25 for 75ml because it's discontinued, and the price may go up. Even though it's nice, it's not a must have, so don't break the bank."", 'One of my rare fragrances in my Barbershop Fougere collection that doesn\'t have a lavender note and isn\'t a Fougere. But it does impart a bit of a barbershop vibe, in large part due to the powderiness. I initially thumbed up Gucci Envy for Men in the ""reminds me of"" list, but have just thumbed that comparison down to remove it. I have Gucci Envy for Men and have gotten familiar with it, and I just don\'t see that much similarity. There may be a distant similarity to the classic Spicy Oriental toiletry scent Old Spice, given the vanilla, spice (cinnamon) and powderiness in both Spicy Orientals. Obviously Presence is much more fluffed out with vanilla sweetness and higher concentration, and classic Old Spice has a more prominent floral component (ironic given the masculine associations of Old Spice). Classic Old Spice, as a Spicy Oriental - albeit a thin, low concentrated one, is another non-fougere frag in my Barbershop collection. Presence is closer in scent profile to another fragrance in my Barbershop Collection, one with lavender and more direct Fougere or fougere-esq characteristics - JPG Le Male. Both vanilla-dominant barbershop fragrances. Presence is sweet, casual, slightly powdery, fluffy, relaxing and clean. Not bad. I like the bottle design too.', ""Smells like shaving cream. Not bad. Just, not something I'd ever wear. I'm not into the Barber Shop Scents. If you are then give this one a try. Update: After trying this one for a day, I'm starting to like it."", 'The visual combo does not work for me - smells like cinnamon but is bright green, my brain doesn’t like it', ""No clue how people are getting Old Spice from Presence, they smell nothing alike. That comparison was what finally pushed me to buy a bottle only to be let down. Old Spice is far heavier and by far a better fragrance. Maybe they're comparing it to one of the body wash offerings, who knows. This is closer to Azzaro Visit which is another underwhelming fragrance. I also find some notes similar to the ones in CK One Shock, Eros, HiM, and Marciano. Presence isn't bad but I can't think of any time I'd actually want to wear this as I already have the similar fragrances I mentioned and they have better overall performance and smell better to me. Doesn't last long at all, four sprays on clothes and skin and it's gone after an hour or two. The dry down is slightly sweet and powdery, kind of reminds me of baby lotion mixed with shaving foam or something of that nature."", 'A combination of barbershop opening with a smooth cashmere and oriental spice drydown. Like someone mixed the top notes of Rive Gauche, the middle of Wanted By Night, and the drydown of Jaipur. Really really lovely.

Hard pass."", 'Cardamom and ginger and sandalwood and almost a licorice aspect.', 'This scent smells and looks as if it was released in the 80s really strange fragrance and I don’t like it', ""FIRST IMPRESSION: I picked up a 50ml from a Macy's backstage 2 days ago for $24.99. Thought it wouldn't be much, but damn I was wrong. Heavy dose of cinnamon and ginger with a touch of cardamom at the top, and the cinnamon lasts throughout the life of the fragrance. I get the apple in the mid mixed with some herbal facet (probably the sage). The base is sweet in a soft way with the tonka bean and amber, mixed with musk and some woods. Probably the best cheapie I have stumbled upon so far along with The Dreamer.  More masculine than feminine in my opinion, but anyone can wear anything. Projection is moderate at best for the first 2-2.5 hours. I don't know what it is, but it just lasts and lasts. I sprayed it yesterday at 8:30 a.m., and I could still pick it up at 11 pm. That was my first full testing, and the more I smelled it, the more I got some resemblance to Layton. I'll provide an update soon. If you can find it, pick it up. Actually worth the retail, but it's so cheap on discounters, might as well save some good money to buy some more fragrances. Perfect night out, date night, and first date fragrance. Subtle enough to be worn anywhere, but don't pull it out when it's hot. 01/27/21 Update: First side by side today. Presence is fresher and more subdued compared to Layton. Where Presence shows more of the amber, musk, ginger, bergamot, sage, cinnamon, and apple on my skin, Layton focuses on apple, vanilla, lavender, tonka bean, and cardamom, at least in the dry down. Put one spray of Layton on my left arm, and put one spray of Presence on my right arm at 8:50 a.m.; it is currently 9:22, and both are still detectable. Layton is pushing out far more and feels more bodied, but then again it is an EDP. As an EDT, Presence is light at this point, but still detectable. Layton surrounds me with a personal bubble, while Presence is more of a personal scent, almost a skin scent. I still think Presence is a fresher, more subdued alternative to Layton, and I think they're different enough where owing both isn't redundant. I don't know if Layton took some inspiration from Presence, but damn, both are really good."", 'In 2002, my 20 year-old daughter and I were coming around the corner in a mall and, without looking each other\'s way or saying a word, we both quicken our step and made a wide circle in sync and walked into a Mont Blanc store.

I am wanting to purchase it for her birthday - yes the men\'s fragrance - because it is such a great memory. I just hope it has not been reformulated as so many have.

I will say it is more suited to a little older/mature crowd. Say 30+', 'A cinnamon blast that dies almost immediately into a sweet bubble-gum scent, gradually making its way to a gentle spice. Rather feminine and way too subtle, as is typical for Mont Blanc.', ""I completely disagree @rtiggs. I wore this fragrance every day in the mid-2000's, in my 20's, and had no problems attracting several young women with Presence. My 19 year old girlfriend bought it for me in 2004 because she thought it was sexy. I wore it to work and another 19 year old girl put her face in my neck so she could smell me.  Some young women are actually attracted to maturity. What other fragrance smells like a classic barbershop scent with a completely modern twist? It references classics like old spice while managing to smell nothing like them. Presence is classy and sophisticated. I get that young people don't want to have to wear a fragrance they feel is too mature for them, but don't act like it's gross and repulsive and say it's only for for people aged 60+! It's ignorant."", 'The first few wears all i could get was a CINNABOMB and i hate cinnamon. As i wore it more it started reminding me of Jaipur Boucheron parfum,& maybe the beginning of Spice bomb. I can see why it got Old Spice and Lemale comparisons. Yes but Presence don\'t got no nasty drydown like those two. Like i said it\'s like Jaipur but not quite there cinnamon taking over. However, it wasn\'t until it started drying down that i was like omg what is this smooth sophisticated unique clean barbershop smell?

So it\'s a winner and has gained sentimental value!', ""I will not say this frag sucks, but it's just not my cup of tea. It does open smelling somewhat like Old Spice.

If you are young minded at any age under 60 this is not for you. This smells like grand dads stash. I blind bought, got it home, one spray, back in the box and returned to the store.

Anywhoo, this is a safe bet for the office, for that first or fiftieth date, for that job interview, heck, its safe enough for just about or for any occasion or setting. Be mindful, as it was with me, had I a significant other wearing this, they could ask for the moon and get it with a ribbon on it!. I do not get any (nada, nothing, no- no, well, maybe a teeny-weeny smidgen)of spices; nothing to blow your socks off, although with other reviewers ginger seems to be a predominate note. It just doesn\'t resonate for me. This is a cuddly, cozy, sexy and dare I say it, could make - you - a - magnet - for - the - opposite - sex- attraction scent, if I ever smelled one. Mind you, these are MY opinions and should not be taken as carte blanche for the masses. As @vertigo has so more aptly phrased it:""...the scent is not seductive - it\'s suggestive..."". So if you are somewhat attractive/attracted to someone, this only amplifies current desires/feelings/thoughts/nuances . . .you get the picture. Update from my Nov 2018 review: I don\'t feel this is a dominant scent, but one which lets you know, hey, I\'m here, and if you\'re interested, here I am, kind of scent. It doesn\'t shout, but it radiates attraction. I am drawn to this scent like few others in my experience. It would never cease to get my attention, if worn on the right person. That said, I would love to smell this on my relatives as well: father, brother, uncle, second-cousin twice removed. My Dad did use to wear Old Spice and it smells faintly of this, but less soapy, just-shaved scent. This scent skips a step and passes on the after shave and goes for this rendition. Only because it invokes feelings of warmth, closeness and companionship with those you love and care about do I associate it with the closeness of family and yes those you love, cherish and care for. IMO, fragrances are not always about getting laid or hunting your next sexual conquest, although many seem it as such for many others. i see this as a scent worn by a man who exudes confidence, and is comfortable in his own skin, but treads with a tad of uncertainty, not for himself, mind you, but on how well you would receive him should you approach him, not the other way around. He would want others to like him, but would not be unaffected by rejection. He is that humble a person. What\'s not to like about a man like that? Since I don\'t have a definite, all-time favorite fragrance I would like to smell on a man, I can say with a great degree of confidence, I would want my husband to smell like this, 50 percent of the time.  This scent only gets better with time and while it remains decidedly close to the skin it still does its magic and continues to invite you into its warm embrace.It does not project much beyond your personal space, but oh, when someone comes within that space they can\'t help but take notice.', ""I bought this scent as a blind-buy and have been wearing it for about a week. I must say, I absolutely love it. It opens fresh, spicy & minty while settling into a smooth, creamy drydown that remains calming throughout the day. The drydown reminds me of a mix between YSL Rive Gauche (that shaving foam scent) and the Original Old Spice. Just pure class in my opinion. It's not a beast mode fragrance but remains very discoverable throughout the day with 3 sprays. You could probably spray more and be OK. This is perfect for an office setting which is where I've been using it. All around this is a very pleasant scent that is elegant but modern. It's unique enough to be a signature scent as well. Give it a go."", 'There is just not enough positive word of mouth about Presence. It is excellent from spray to drydown. It is spicy and calming without being very sweet. Just great.', ""This smells better than spicebomb to my nose and inst cloying since it doesn't project."", ""This is a soothing scent. It's 60 to zero dry down is disappointing, as the opening is refreshing and promising. The dry down is calming and reminds me of Ambre Gris by Pierre Balmain, only lighter around the edges. Whereas AG's dry down longevity is about the same, it still has a greater presence in its dry down than Presence's morphing into an almost undetectable skin scent. After reapplying Presence after about 3 hours after the initial spray, it seems to remind me of hairdress/pomade with a woody petroleum base. Weird.. . .very strange indeed."", ""Sickly sweet and smells cheap in my opinion. I've smelled loads of similar scents over the last few years, and admittedly quite liked them in my early fragrance years, but grown tired of this type of scent nowadays. Younger audiences will like it possibly, but it's not for me. Reminds me of JPG male, as in synthetic sweet vanilla scent."", ""What makes this fragrance great? Hands down it's unique, nothing else smells like it. While everyone is smelling like some blue boxed cologne you can smell like a manly box of Applejack's!"", 'Thank you goes out to Ryanmmas26. Your review convinced me to blind buy Presence. It is almost summer and very warm here. I am wearing Presence and it is appropriate for the temperature and really very good. It opens with cinnamon and ginger. This is not baking cinnamon, but woody, barky cinnamon that blends with the aroma of sandalwood for a creamy base.  My mother always made a party punch out of Ginger Ale and Lime Sherbet. Mont Blanc Presence reminds me strongly of that party punch and I love it. It really does smell like a really refreshing shaving cream. It smells soothing, smooth, and cool. Longevity is the weakness. It lasts about three hours with 2 feet of sillage. Then about two hours as a skin scent. I wish it was better. I still love it. This is a year-round, day/night utility scent.', ""To me, this is a man I am going to talk to. This will grab ladies attention. It's sweet like apple pie but also spicy with a hint of danger. Underneath it all you get the sense of freshness that says everything is fun and games. Makes me think of a man's deodorant but in the best way. Like he is fresh out of a shower and getting dressed to go out and the various grooming products he uses are all mingling together. There is a very sexual vibe here despite all the freshness. Like making out with a boy who has been doing cinnamon schnapps. It's good but you know it's nothing serious."", 'An easy to wear and easy to like fragrance. You get a pleasing lavender, aromatic feel and some mint. All is rather tame and well rounded like many Mont Blanc fragrances.In the base a pleasing amber comes through as well. The problem comes from performance. I get 2 to 3 hours longevity with weak projection and silage.  Like star-walker this is a deal breaker for me and Have to have 5 hours plus , unless it is a real intimate or special occasion masterpiece. This one is a great teenager fragrance and can be found at discounters. I cannot see this worm by anyone over 20 in my opinion. This is neither sexy, formal ,Special, an attention grabber or fit any real need in my collection.  If you want something in this style there is kryptomint by Mugler and Roadster by Cartier. I believe they are better fragrances and I am sure there is something niche out there too.  A Pass for me.', 'Had to re-review this 1 as I liked it before but I’ve really grown to love this ! Presence is a very soapy,semi-spicy,green,pleasant,aromatic with just the right amount of sweetness to give it a sensual edge. I love this scent for 2 reasons and those 2 reasons are work and for lounging around the house as it has a very clean but also relaxin,soothing nature to it. The notes that really stick out to me are the apple,cinnamon and amber. (Also to note that this is 1 of 3 of my go to relaxing scents along with Burberry Touch and Versace The Dreamer) Performance on this could be better but its still decent for a cheapie. It lasts 6-10 hours but only has soft projection on my skin but for the whole scent life it does leave a nice scent bubble as well as a nice Sillage trail. This has received compliments from time to time but it hasn’t been anything that’s attracted a lot of attention like some of my heavy hitters. Overall rating —7.5 out of 10 ! Very unique scent that is appealing and perfect for casual use but it does lose points from this stuff barely projecting but it does gain points for being cheap and being long lasting. Sidenote: This drydown is really good and easily my favorite part of this fragrance ! Also Presence is perfect for spring :)', 'Soupy spicy version of le male with a hint of mint 7/10', 'A nicely blended fragrance with a spicy barbershop vibe (is that even a thing??). I like that it starts clean and bright without being too citrusy or sweet. it goes more barbershop as it dries down. The barbershop stays throughout the life of the scent, but gets warmed up by the wood and musk notes making for a nice combination. It is elegant but not stuffy. As noted by others, you have to hold off judgement until you go through all the stages of this EDT...went from like to love over the course of a couple of hours. good longevity. so-so sillage. Another win for Montblanc.', ""Was one of the first frags I owned after getting into the hobby, it still holds it's own after experiencing top end frags. The opening accord is fresh, soapy and minty - very smooth like a toned down peppermint cream. As it drys down the cinnamon and sweet apple start to come through - those notes don't stand out but it's the best way I can describe the well blended accords. It's like a modernised version of a classic barbershop. Incredibly versatile, I would wear it anytime apart from a hot summers day but even then it wouldn't be a bad choice, I just have better things to wear then. I love wearing this to work, it's fresh, clean and classy with a soft edge. At around £22 for 75ml on eBay inc. delivery it's a 9+/10. To me it really stands out amongst the clearly synthetic smelling scents around the same price. I think the bargain price is due to the fact it been around for a while and it's not a fashionable scent, not a reflection on the quality of the juice."", ""Presence by Montblanc Review Presence opens up with a blast of spicy cardamom, cinnamon, and ginger. This is a pleasant fresh spicy opening. The scent then takes a turn towards being more sweet with a green apple note. The fragrance is held up by a soft tonka bean dry down. It's inoffensive and quite nice. This is a great dumb reach fragrance. It could be used for any casual or work situation. It has absolutely no wow factor though. Find something else for dates or formal.  This is the third Montblanc fragrance I've purchased along with Individuel and Legend Intense. Legend Intense is my favorite of the three. As far as smell is concerned, Individuel and Presence are on the same level for me. Individuel has better performance though and seems more mass appealing. The performance on this one is not great. I go heavy, well for me at least, with 4 to 5 sprays.

It\'s crowd pleasing but stands out and is very different, for the opening at least. The opening is fruity and spicy but isn\'t sweet and maintains a freshness that I attribute to the ginger top note. Pretty damn masculine for a modern fresh designer scent.  Now, I came so close to buying this... sooooo close. Then, about 30 min in, the test strip stopped projecting and I smelled this semi-generic spicy-tonka-fruit frag. Though ""spicy-tonka-fruit"" frags aren\'t necessarily common or a buzzword by any means of the imagination, it didn\'t have the same ""pop"" or head-turning effect one gets from its opening or from Individuel. due to this and the performance, i put it on the backburner. Will be purchasing Individuel soon though.', ""As usual, another blind-buy last year. First sprayed that time and didn't like it, so kept it for more than a year. This week, tried it again with moderate hopes, and it didn't disappoint! Maybe my sense of smell last year was quite different, or I was looking for very sweet or citrusy ones like Rochas Man or Clinique Happy. This week I was in the mood to try my other ones and this scent is quite addictive I kept on sniffing my wrist where I've sprayed it. Was planning to give this away as a present but no, I'm keeping it for myself!

It starts out with heavy cardamom overshadowing the cinnamon and apple, and surprisingly, it smells like Spicebomb, but fresher. Kind of how I imagine Spicebomb Eau Fraiche would smell. The middle of the life is where the cinnamon shines, but the apple freshness sticks around to keep this warm weather appropriate. The final dry down smells like Versace Eros (spicy, minty apple) even though I don't see any mint in the notes.  Unfortunately today I only got about 4 hours out of this, but the bottle I bought was 5 years old, so that may have something to do with it. The scent, I'd rate rather highly for the other scents mentioned that it resembles. I wasn't happy with performance, but for what it's worth, it seems like everyone else is getting much better performance than I am!"", ""What a unique scent this is and when you have a collection of 200 + fragrances that says a lot !!! This opens up kind of minty but spicy at the same time and to be honest a lot of people said they like the opening but personally I'm not a big fan. Once this reaches the heart the apple and cinnamon really mix together well leaving you with a smell similar to those seasonal air apple spice air fresheners you can get in fall. The drydown on this is really nice and my favorite part of the fragrance. This dries down to become a very soapy and ambery scent that is soft,relaxing and very pleasant !!!! It will definitely be a go to on those days after work that I get a shower and just want to kick back and have a few beers. Although this is very pleasant I don't see this being a compliment getter. The reasons I say that is because it's very soft and smells more like either a really nice soap or again very similar to a lot of seasonal air fresheners.lol  Performance is actually pretty good ! It doesn't project like a beast but you will get nice wafts of it throughout the day and this lasts 6-12 hours ( This has varied a lot on my skin) Overall rating --- 7.5 out of 10 !!! Very pleasant and relaxing scent that I really enjoy and can see myself eventually loving as time goes on."", 'Impulsive blind buy! The first spray is very, very fresh. I get mint and lots of clean air tinged with cinnamon and traces of ginger.  The dry down settles into a balmy apple/herb zest that clings close to the skin, but last for hours. Low projection and good longevity. I still think the freshness takes away the heart of the scent.  Good at this price and would probably buy again, better enjoyed in the cooler months and intimate moments. 8/10.', ""Sentence Summary: Brings back fond memories of eating a stick of rock (candy) in a barbershop which, to the best of my knowledge, I've never done before. For the record, I think this is the best from the house, and one of my absolute favourites from any house.

The emerald-looking juice seduced me and I gave it a spray on my forearm. I knew instantly that I had to have this unique scent. I initially got mint notes in the opening, but now that I actually own a bottle, I've been able to analyze the scents better and I believe the combination of cinnamon/ginger is what dominates the opening. It mellows down to fresh (apple) and spicy notes with just the right amount of wood in the base. Very unique and versatile, IMO. Performance is average and the value is good. I'm glad to have this in my collection now; it will get a lot of playing time this Spring season. Grade: B+"", ""To me, the best from the house of Montblanc, together with Legend Intense.

I smelled this and was immediately transported back in time 7 years.  It\'s a very green, mature, barbershop kind of smell. You definitely get some cinnamon, but not in the big red gum sense. It\'s more like cinnamon bark peeled from the tree. I think there is some mint hiding in there as well.  If you are looking for a mature, clean scent, this is a good choice. I bought it for the novelty and ""fond"" memories of my time in the military.', 'Blind bought 75 mL after weeks of research.  Guys, to me, the first spray on paper smells incredibly similar to Le Male or The Dreamer. In a few short minutes, it takes on a slightly feminine soapy characteristic. It\'s very inviting and subtle, but DEFINITELY not that unique. I get the cinnamon, sage, sandalwood, tonka and musk, with a very creamy drydown. It\'s quite synthetic to my nose, but I really don\'t care.  Longevity is 8 hours on me and projection is moderate at best. With 4 sprays, you get a 2 foot scent bubble for the first 2 hours, and then it calms down quite a bit. As Greggieboy76 mentions on YouTube, it\'s blended very well and has this ethereal quality that is unlikely to ever become cloying, even in summer weather. It\'s very sweet, subtle and a little powdery, meaning that it\'s inoffensive and perfect for office wear - and even feels ""more expensive"" than say, Lacoste pour Homme (eventhough it\'s cheaper). Overall, it\'s a ""handsome"" and more mature, but very versatile cologne that anyone 18+ can pull off. But if you already have Individuel, Le Male or The Dreamer, this would just be redundant, because to me, this is just Le Male for the office. Still it\'s a solid 8.5/10. And if you enjoy fragrances from the 90s, you\'ll probably appreciate this stuff even more. Enjoy.', ""Just bought a bottle of this from a good supplier after reading all the positive reviews but I'm not sure if I've got a duff bottle but I can hardly smell anything and it lasts about 20 minutes before I can no longer smell anything at all, very disappointed. UPDATE Aug 16 Not sure why I didn't really smell anything first time round, maybe the bottle needed some air in it, but however I tried it again and wow what a difference. I could pick out the subtle notes and the cinnamon this time and the longevity was reasonable on my skin around 3-4 hours. So despite the initial hiccup, I now really like this and I'm using it quite a bit. Happy bunny at last."", '- Soapy tranquility - Huge fan of Presence here. What I most like about this is the ""zen"" vibe that I get out of this. To me this fragrance is all about balance. There\'s a union between chemical apple and natural cinnamon as well as the mix of spicy, sweet, soapy and woody. It\'s everything and nothing at the same time! While Presence is pretty safe and clean it does indeed give me this small boost of confidence that others have also mentioned. It doesn\'t try too hard to be a sexy mens cologne but kind of feels naturally like that. You know those people who simply are charming without them even knowing it - that\'s the scent of Presence! Sillage is average but this tends to last very long on my skin. Great purchase!', ""I get a nice cinnamon-heavy spicy opening but what I find strange is that I actually mainly get a heavy dose of leather and violet leaf which really reminds me of the dark, heavy side of Dior Fahrnheit, strange considering neiither of these notes ar noticeable in the opening but around 3 hours in there's a definite violet dominated vibe going on, very odd development coonsidering the opening is completel different."", 'If you are looking for something that will go well at all times, treat yourself then with Presence Pour Homme de Mont Blanc, because in my view it is the style of ""bitch"" perfumão that pleases who uses it and who feels at all senses, and it is rare to find ever since and today even more so.

Presence is unique and gorgeous!', 'I totally agree with olfactoryfan in that its scent is unobtrusive, clean, pleasant and fresh. I also agree with JustAverage in that it gives a feeling of confidence.

At the beginning I was like "" OMA (oh my allah) this is something that I\'ve been looking for a long time. The first thing that came into my mind was that this is a soapy perfume, and I loved it. Next day I went there and bought it <3  So...It\'s powerful but not very very powerful. I love it  from my opinion I\'d give this a 8.6/10. The reason for this is because the silage is not the best but it\'s enough to get you noticed. Buy it if you think you like soapy scents. It\'s a "" must "" in your collection <3', ""I'm a sucker for the soapies and Mont Blanc's Presence is a goodie. It's the perfect name for this fragrance because it creates a mysterious aura around me as it radiates almost imperceptibly. Upon first application, I'm reminded of those candy scented erasers I had in my pencil case when I was at school - the ones that smelt so good you wanted to nibble them. There's a slight mintiness to the initial opening too. It does share some similarities with Individuel - it's like a softer variation of its sibling. After this brief intro phase, it soon blends into the background, staying just under the radar on the edge of perception. Presence simply gives you an unobtrusive clean, pleasant freshness. Pleasant is the key descriptive word here - it's genuinely pleasant smelling stuff. It's certainly not ground-breaking, but it's phenomenal the way it performs so discreetly for many hours, quietly making its presence known.

For some reason I reach for it. I have better colognes but none of them relaxes me like this on a hectic day at work. I feel confident, not cocky. I pick up the apple and Ginger notes with musk, vanilla like. For its price I would consider buying it again. An overall decent cologne for its price."", 'Imagine that a great song starts to play, and all you have are those flimsy airline ear-buds on. Think of a hot looking car, painted a dull grey.

My wrist smells great as this is being typed, a warm, sweet, spicy, gingery scent, Starts out soapy clean, and then turns warm andsemi-sweet. The issue with this fragrance is that it’s simply a presence, a good one, but not anything which anyone other than the person wearing it will remember. One needs self-confidence to wear, not because Presence has attitude, but because it is not a scent which will get you compliments, or noticed, it will simply make you feel relaxed, and as if you are in charge, not the scent.', 'Another masterpiece by mont blanc!

Presence can be described in 2 words"" Jaipur Lite"". I did a side by side comparison and the cinnamon and tonka bean notes are very similar. Where Annick Menardo\'s classic is a very formal fragrance and a true spicy, floral oriental with the addition of benzoin, jasmine, carnation to the cinnamon, tonka, cardamom combo, Presence goes in a slightly more easy going direction with green apple and ginger. If you love Jaipur like I do, you will find Presence a wonderful,high quality, lighter version of it and probably more versatile for it. If you have not smelled Jaipur but are into or looking to get into orientals, Presence is a great choice either ways. Good projection for about 5 hours and with a little layering, I get about 7-8 hours longevity on skin. I can smell it on my shirt for a lot longer. This is a great fragrance for all occasions, the office, dinner n drinks, just hanging out with buddies, works anywhere as long as you are well dressed. ( not a gym frag) It can be found online at very affordable prices as well making it painless to replace once you finish your bottle so that\'s a plus as well. All in all, a winner.

The prices are about like the mall and maybe a little cheaper.It came gift wrapped in a larger box.It was very classy.I know it is for show, but it was still a little exciting. I will first agree, with one review I read,longevity is not great. I found a body lotion at Bath and Body Works,in the men's section called Cardamom it is very nice for eleven dollars.I think the top notes linger around seven to ten minutes and then the Cardamom comes into play. I will, after my shower,when still rather wet rub the lotion in good and let it sink in. I then, after about ten minutes apply the presence.Spray down low on your chest,the neck area and wrist and inside elbows.It is a nice classy scent,while it last and on some people it last longer,hint the Cardamom lotion should take care of dry skin and add a uniqueness to it.

Soap, soap and more soap! Sometimes when people describe fragrances as being soapy I often don\'t agree or think...""Wow...what kind of soap are you using?"" But this has a classic soapy note.  There\'s something in the very top notes like a sharp fruity thing that is just delightful but disappears fairly quickly, then the dry down is really wonderful it truly has more dimensions than it first appears.

At first I thought that Individuel and Presence were the same. After I came home I sprayed on each one of my wrists to give it the sniff test. There is some similarity, but there is enough of a dif which makes each cologne an excellent frag. The main notes that I find in common with both is the very rich aroma of warm spicy and cinnamon. Now about Presence, I just wish I didn't wait so long to buy this frag which is MAGNIFICENT !!! The opening notes of cinnamon and ginger combined with a very fresh green note of apple and sage makes it a lighter fragrance which is perfect during the daytime.  The base notes of sandalwood, amber and white musk makes this fragrance a very CLASSY and SOPHISTICATED manly cologne. Tonka bean gives it a slightly sweet scent but not heavy in any way.  Altogether I really enjoy the fresh spicy aroma with a warm balmy tone. Longevity is superb..it isn't heavy but it stay on well past 8 hours. If you layer the frag, it will last well past 12hrs. Sillage is very good, moderate but I don't find it weak at all.  This frag can draw your very special person to wanna get closer to you. I'll warn you, whatever happens after is without a doubt the power of this frag which makes it very attractive and yet it isn't over powering.

This I count a little treasure, my introduction to this line. Occasionally I do find some men\'s fragrances that are what would fall into my own personal ""unisex"" parameters & this would be one of those. I have worn this one a few times because it does pose it\'s own sort of complexity as it is such a fresh spice; one moment it seems almost linear in the drydown of woods---teakwood & sandalwood, and then when I have enjoyed the richness of the woods, it is as if someone threw ginger root & maybe a cinnamon stick on a gorgeous glowing fire of fresh woods sprinkled with blossoms. The touch of the floral is distinctive though & I suspect it is what gives this one such a pleasant over-all character. I can see why this one would not be every man\'s cup of tea, though. It is not what I would consider to be an overtly masculine aroma. Maybe that is because I have never smelled it on a man to my knowledge.  This is a sweet, woody & spicy yet somewhat tasteful, soft interpretation of this genre with enough heliotrope to really make it interesting. I can imagine a very reserved, classy & refined ""metro-sexual"" young man or even distinguished senior, but regardless---one that is not afraid to wear a sweet & spicy subtle scent. It has good longevity on me, lasts 6 hours or so, but a soft sillage for a spicy fragrance.  Presence seems to have a nice touch of elegance all it\'s own. Cheers, guys! PS Edit Update: I have had this on all day today & it grows sweeter, woody-spicier but in savoring it\'s aroma on my wrist over & over, it makes me wish it had a touch of oakmoss & civet. Maybe that is because it has blended with a feminine skin, though, & I am longing for a more animalic scent to make me think more of a masculine aroma. How I would love to smell this gem on a man!

Update 2024: After 15 years I decided to give it another try. I wasn’t disappointed! This smells very comfortable. It opens up fresh with half cinammon and half apple note that settles down into a soapy half powdery calming smell. It is not that strong now as I remembered it to be. The bottle changed also to a more conventional one. It does transmit elegance and refinement. Good for layering as well with freshies.', 'cinnamon ""screams"" in this fragrance. But, is a awesome product. Buy and be happy! Presence and Individuel are the best fragrances of the brand.', 'at fist gingers and sour smell entered my nose, well a good feeling must say! i could also sense a lil jasmine and cinamon which makes a gr8 combo in my opinion.. secondly i loved the bottle shape and color of the liquid! well overall a good perfume with fair lasting.. i would recommend it especially if u are seeking a  winter wear!', 'To me Mont Blanc thought about two well known perfumes to make two of its own: Joop! Homme and Jaipur Homme(this one I know thanks to the help of the reviewer hoelahoep). Individuel and Presence, respectively. Since is just a hint of the originals by these two, Presence is not remarkable like Jaipur, its oriental side is light compare to, and has a feeling that looks to be a signature by Mont Blanc, as seen in Individuel: an unnatural chord, almost medicinal, I can not describe it correctly. A hit here in Brazil among successful young adults (I think), easily recognizable.', ""i find it a little bit medicinal. the smell is good and like many said it is suitable for formal kind of people...I'll enjoy wearing it in special occasions but honestly it is not a favorite of mine..."", 'This is something special!it feels like Taj Mahal in a moonlit night with my soulmate.The drydown is amazing,very sophisticated stuff,musk and amber lit up the base notes pretty well.Got it today.', ""One of my favs. Présence is comfortable, very peculiar and recognizable. And even though clearly made for those who wear blazers and ties, I find it totally cool on a jeans/T-shirt kind of guy, like me. I don't get it when people complain there's too much cinnamon here. I mean, I don't deny there indeed is, but I think the cinnamon + cardamom combo is the soul of Présence, and what makes it stand out from other scents. Anyway, the spices don't scream around for that long. Within some 20 minutes, they're still present, but in low profile mode, well tamed by the musky base. IMO this is the best offering by Montblanc, and the one closest to their branding strategies: gentlemanly and distinct, and very clear in communicating it. Oh, here I'm talking about perfumes only, not pens or watches. Finally, I totally agree with both omega_69 and vertigo. This is THE scent to take a girl out for a fancy dinner or a couple of drinks. This is a scent for when you're in the mood to open doors for her, but still allow yourself to bust on her."", ""As vertigo said, it's a warm, sensual, gentlemanly scent. My fiance totally loves this one, as do I. This is the evening fragrance I reach for when we're going out for a nice dinner and drinks; it's my dressy fragrance."", 'This is a very pleasing scent. it is spicy without being overly so and musky without being overly so. It smells more like an aromatic fougere to me - especially after it has had about half an hour on the skin. Citrus, spice, musk and wood are all nicely balanced.', 'To me it\'s spicy, but not very oriental. Warm and sensual, but doesn\'t lack strength and self-confidence. It could be an autumn/winter day fragrance for a man over 25 or over 30 who likes to attract people, especially women. For a man who likes life, domination, competition, respects luxury and pleasures.  But the scent is not seductive - it\'s just suggestive.  The man who wears it enjoys life, in a ""gentleman"" manner.', ""The only aspect in which this fragrance is cheap, is price-wise.  I takes a very special scent of spice to persuade my floral/citrus/apple loving nose to love it.  Girls, if you find this in your man's cabinet, have a spritz. It's a whack in your face of bergamot and especially cardamom right at first, but the dry-down will leave you speechless. Apple, cinnamon, woodnotes, amber; sexy, sexy, sexy. I almost pocketed this from my man's collection and declared it mine, it's unisex and it's delicious, and I want it."", ""I find presence addictive, unique and lovely. Moderate longevity and silage. No cinnamon on me though. It's a fresh/soapy/spicy scent with a touch of sweet sherbet. Will buy this again when I run out!"", ""I completely disagree @rtiggs. I wore this fragrance every day in the mid-2000's, in my 20's, and had no problems attracting several young women with Presence. My 19 year old girlfriend bought it for me in 2004 because she thought it was sexy. I wore it to work and another 19 year old girl put her face in my neck so she could smell me.  Some young women are actually attracted to maturity. What other fragrance smells like a classic barbershop scent with a completely modern twist? It references classics like old spice while managing to smell nothing like them. Presence is classy and sophisticated. I get that young people don't want to have to wear a fragrance they feel is too mature for them, but don't act like it's gross and repulsive and say it's only for for people aged 60+! It's ignorant."", 'Presence is my third Mont Blanc after Exceptionnel and Individuel and so far 3 for 3, all good ones, so bravo Mont Blanc. Presence can be described in 2 words"" Jaipur Lite"". I did a side by side comparison and the cinnamon and tonka bean notes are very similar. Where Annick Menardo\'s classic is a very formal fragrance and a true spicy, floral oriental with the addition of benzoin, jasmine, carnation to the cinnamon, tonka, cardamom combo, Presence goes in a slightly more easy going direction with green apple and ginger. If you love Jaipur like I do, you will find Presence a wonderful,high quality, lighter version of it and probably more versatile for it. If you have not smelled Jaipur but are into or looking to get into orientals, Presence is a great choice either ways. Good projection for about 5 hours and with a little layering, I get about 7-8 hours longevity on skin. I can smell it on my shirt for a lot longer. This is a great fragrance for all occasions, the office, dinner n drinks, just hanging out with buddies, works anywhere as long as you are well dressed. ( not a gym frag) It can be found online at very affordable prices as well making it painless to replace once you finish your bottle so that\'s a plus as well. All in all, a winner. I love it. 8.5/10', ""Totally underrated and excellent value! After falling in love with Mont Blanc's Individuel and seeing Master of Style's 10/10 review of this one I had to try it. Presence doesn't disappoint - it's yet another winner from Mont Blanc. A handsome, elegant fragrance of superb quality that dries down to an incredible powdery, spicy cinnamon musk. Presence comes in a great understated bottle of Mont Blanc's usual high quality with a warm & spicy signature-worthy fragrance inside that's suited for anything from the office to a night out. If you've got a nose for Orientals, this is one of the best out there."", ""This smells better than spicebomb to my nose and inst cloying since it doesn't project."", ""I had the unfortunate pleasure of buying this one at my local Ross. I was looking for Starwalker by Montblanc and found this little nugget. Opening: A semi-sweet hot summer day in an Indian restaurant. Dry Down: A spicy hot summer day in an Indian restaurant. There's a hidden cumin note, a very bad time. Hard pass."", ""As others reviewers stated here, I also got a sharp-sweet opening with a lot of ginger & cinnamon thrown there. In the next 10-15 minutes it already combines the middle notes where the adding association of apple (zesty-fruity), sage (herbal spicy) and heliotrope produces an effect at least sickly-weird on my skin... Not a truly oriental, neither a fresh-spicy one, it just seems to react different on other people's skin (aren't they all do that ?).  Unfortunatelly, this doesn't suit me at all, so I'll give it a 7/10 for weirdness (which, btw. sometimes it work for me also !).☣☣"", ""The opening I like. I do see the Prada Amber association in the beginning, perhaps mixed with Royal Copenhagen Musk. The mid is spicy and nice. I don't believe it smells anything like JPG. The dry down, unfortunately, smells like Versace Blue Jeans. That's where this perfume falls apart.  I absolutely hate Blue Jeans. I think it smells of used urinal kegs and methadone. While this isn't quite as bad as BJ the association can't be forgotten (for me) 😭. Longevity and projection are really poor too. But that doesn't really bother me much."", ""First Pass - Floral. Powdery. Feminine My nose isn't in line with the build. Where are the cinnamon and cardamom? I don't get bergamot, zero citrus notes. Maybe I do get some ginger now that I'm looking for it, but I wouldn't have found it independently 1 Hour Later - Full on baby powder. I feel like I'm bending over a toddler crib. Still floral. Maybe rose? Guessing the sweetness is coming from apple. I don't know how heliotrope smells, but that and sage must be the source of the floridity. Base has a cornucopia of accords, sandalwood, teak wood, white musk, amber and tonka bean, none of which shine through individually I can't isolate the wood or musk at all. Maybe they're slight, or maybe they are blending with the floral notes to give the powdery emanation Overall - While I enjoy delicate, nuanced fragrances (and this is certainly that), floral & powdery scents resonate as feminine to me. If you like soft, floral, powdery accords, you'll find a lot to appreciate here. Albeit one of the best in-category I've sampled, I doubt anything could convert me to this style. ***Scents, like tastes, are subjective. Wear what you like***""]"

To my nose EDP is neither a blue fragrance nor an aquatic, despite that Adidas describes it as aquatic. The EDP is a ""platinum"" genre. It\'s super high vibration yet creamy mint and aromatics. The box vaunts that it contains ""natural citrus essential oil"" and yes. Also I smell the lavender. I\'m not sure I like it on my skin but I like it fine in the air and on clothes. On skin it smells like a mens shampoo or grooming product more than a fragrance. It\'s one of those fragrances you have to mist and walk into because concentrated on a small area of skin it can be cloying. I might like it more with some outright menthol or camphor, eucalyptus.  Remember, I\'m describing the new Eau de Parfum. This is not a relaxing EDP, it\'s energising, masculine and a bit edgy. I\'m thinking of some of those Jaguar freshies. Ice Dive has never been one of my favored Adidas fragrances and this EDP extends it in a weird direction.

In the prior early 2000 formulations under COTY, I actually used all the Adidas body washes, body sprays and colognes and Ice Dive was by far my favorite of the lot. It had a distinctive sea salt note that was very pleasant and set it apart from other products at the time. Then the entire line seemed to disappear.  Cue the current 2020\'s era and the entire Adidas line reappears. I wasted no time buying both the body wash and EDT. There\'s definitely been a formulation change, as the opening is now much better than I remember, with a complex mix of fresh, citrus, aquatic and powder aromas. However, it is also very much missing that distinctive sea salt note. Without it, there really is nothing that sets this apart from other fresh blue style fragrances on the market. FYI, I also notice that sea salt note missing from the body wash as well despite it being listed in the ingredients.  And this is where this fragrance really gets killed -- the performance is absolutely terrible. By far the worst projection and sillage I have experienced now that I\'ve become a cologne hobbyist. I\'ve been critical in my reviews of some of the English Laundry colognes due to their poor performance but the Adidas Ice Dive is far, far worse than they are in that respect. Even massive overspraying does nothing to help out.  The bottom line is that if you\'re seriously into fragrances at all -- and you must be if you\'re on this site -- then Ice Dive has no business standing next to all the other designer and niche fragrances in your collection. It probably doesn\'t even stand up to some of the other bargain colognes we affectionately refer to as ""cheapies"" right next to where you would also find this for sale.  It\'s really too bad. I have very fond memories of this and I\'d argue it could still be something special if it were properly reformulated. It really needs that sea salt back and the performance vastly improved. Of course, this would also jack up the price but I say it would be worth it to turn this into a truly quality product.', ""I wear this in the school year,whiches I go to the night club in the same time haha it's amazing. It giving me the nostalgic feeling,good memories with this perfume. I love the sweet smell from the ambergris and the citrusy note. it's kinda like an old vibes but it's good for me. my nose can accept this"", ""The Adidas Victory league and Ice Dive were my very first fragrances when I was 9 years old. I remember both of them being really nice as a 9 year old kid does 😂 Very recently I came across both of the fragrances in a random store, I felt very nostalgic so I had to snatch a bottle of both. It came to my attention that the packaging got an update, alongside with that, I think the formulation might have gotten an update as well... Both Victory league as well as Ice Dive smell so different to me now. I remember that Ice Dive used to smell exactly like Bleu de Chanel to me, but now it just smells very aquatic in a synthetic way and even somewhat metallic. I don't like it anymore. The longevity is so weak, it's ridiculous at this point. You have to overspray Adidas fragrances in order to get something out of them, and even then, they last for a maximum of an hour. I'd have to say that I'm disappointed, I wouldn't necessarily repurchase any of the Adidas fragrances just because of the performance. Sadly, this fragrance gets a 3/10 from me."", 'Fresh and bracing. A sweet sparkling opening of mint, lavender and citruses. There is a slight fruitiness overall, but it quickly becomes a clean, musky skin scent after 45 mins - 1 hr. Projection is ok for the first half hour, longevity as a skin scent is about 2 - 3 hrs. Best suited for summer, more a day scent than anything else. A solid pick-me-up spritz for the price. Could be unisex. If you like this and want something similar but with better performance try - Uomo Trussardi 2011 Trussardi.  Would also like to add you can often find Ice Dive as a gift set around X-mas time and it comes with a shower gel + bodyspay/deodorant. The deo-spray really compliments the EDT and the whole set is usually inexpensive!', 'There are ""Edition 2022"" of Ice Dive, Team Force, Pure Game and Victory League. Has anyone noticed a difference?', ""A very forgettable fragrance, I don't even know how or why I own it... there are so many better alternatives; it only lasts for about 2 hours and it has weak silage, none the less after a workout, if you don't have a shower nearby, it can come in handy. Get it for that 15yr old kid as a present they won't complain, they might even like it. edit: after this review, I started paying more attention to this, and I realized that it's one of those fragrances that you can spray a shit tone and not worry about because it's dirt cheap, spray it in a room, on a wet blazer, or in your shoes?

Just kidding; it is clearly not a clubbing frag!!!!!--it's the most light, transparent thing you could ever wear. It doesn't smell any more synthetic than any other designer brand to me though, but just obviously has less concentration. Think of it as a Japanese minimalist watercolor painting of Bleu de Chanel and for the first few minutes, about 35% Aqua di Gio. I own the Parfum and there is a clear similarity: the lavender, tonka and musk accords.

For under $10, great!"", ""Some good reviews, honest, not letting the cost get in the way. I have three Adidas frags I consistently pick up. For the price they are a great casual wear, that will not offend. For Ice Dive I get mint and yuzu right off the top, dries into lavender, tonka, anise and soft performing woods with florals. The opening is fresh and really quite nice, then it turns to a slightly old school style with a modern blue twist. It is obviously very synthetic, but a great deal for under $20.00, and let's be honest, I pick this up for six bucks regularly, GREAT deal that makes any argument against the scent pretty much invalid. This lasts about 3 hours, pretty much a skin scent after the first 30 minutes. Mostly sits as a citrus, mint, and lavender with a touch of tonka/vanilla at the core dry down point. Once it settles it becomes rather flat, it's expected, but disappointing with all the openings brightness and energy.

Only the opening resembles that of BDC since the drydown of BDC has a dominant vetiver & incense which are missing in this.  Overall a good cheapie.

Edit Nov 2020: Cold November temperatures have improved Ice Dive's projection to a few hours and it's also more of a perfume impact: sweet, citrus flowers and spice, on a light oriental base. Philippe Bousseton has done a couple Cool Water flankers, and get this, he did Tsar! I like to liberally splash the after shave, wait an hour, then top it with the EDT.

Cool clean and fresh it's great for freshening up after sporting activities it really is invigorating.  7/10"", ""Fourth Review on Fragrantica. I am new to fragrances and blind purchased a lot of different bottles from various designers, spring of 2019. I am an American male in my 20s. Adidas' Ice Dive is one of the first fragrances I purchased to find out which kinds of notes/scents that I liked through testing. It starts off with a spicy (Anise) bombardment of sweet (Mandarin Orange, Yuzu) and sour/bitter citrus (Grapefruit, Bergamot). The Grapefruit and Kiwi give it a sweet and tangy opener. Mint hangs on through the scent's evolution, keeping it clean. Lavender wraps everything up with that classic soapy smell. Immediately afterwards you get a potent green and/or earthy (Patchouli) and floral (Geranium) vibe. Then even more immediately afterwards you get a flagrant body spray (musk) and salt (the ambergris) with pepper. So, a balance of sweet, sour, salty, spicy notes with freshness. The main accords my nose gets is: fresh spicy, aromatic, and citrus. The scent itself gets a 7/10. The issue I have is that it has some of the worst performance I've experienced. The sillage is a little beyond a skin scent after minutes of application. And the longevity is underwhelming to the point that after 30 minutes to a hour it kind of disqualifies itself from having longevity due to how weak the scent is at that point. The concentration of this seems to be that of a Cologne. Unless you love to smell it, I couldn't recommend this. After having owned a miniature size of Versace's Pour Homme Dylan Blue for a couple months, I'll say that the fresh spicy citrus nuances in both are truly in the same vein. They both contain pepper, grapefruit, bergamot, patchouli, and musk. And though they have distinctive notes apart from one another, I believe they don't go too far off from one another in the end.

One could use this before going to sleep, due to the fact that it is soothing. However I will not buy this again, due to the lack of potency.  It could work as something to have in a gym bag, but please remember that it does not last at all, meaning that it will not interfere with your evening smell later on.

Even though that seems like what it would be from the notes posted above. This is adidas showing some attidue that is out of their character. I'm glad to see them make a stab outside of the safety zone. Edit: I've spent more time with this and see a resemblance to Bleu De Chanel that people have mentioned.

Much better than ""get ready"", but one can still smell the cheapness in it. Its exactly the same as ""get ready"" in terms of terrible silage and longevity, but the scent is much more pleasant. Why it\'s so mediocre: 1. Scent - Its actually pretty nice. It\'s fresh and a little minty. It doesn\'t smell too synthetic and could potentially fool someone into thinking it\'s more expensive than it is, if the longevity and scent weren\'t so terrible that is. 2. Longevity - Same as ""Get Ready"" - really bad. It lasts like 30 minutes to an hour if you\'re lucky and have applied 10 or more sprays. 3. Silage - Again poor. Moderate only when you apply many many sprays... but then it lasts for a short time. Conclusion: I personally would never buy this. I got it as a gift. It\'s not too bad tho.

Ice Dive does not really change all that much, it stays quite linear. Longevity is OK, you should get 4-6 hours. Sillage or projection is quite good for the first 2 hours, it will push of the skin but then it starts to sit quite close to the skin. Overall I do like Ice Dive, but only as a very casual scent.

The promotional advertisement showed a young man in a fighter jet. The marketing failed because as we know 9/11 sadly occured that year. This fragrance never really became popular due to the disastrous marketing promotion. It's a shame because this is a great fragrance. In North America, it was to be the first mainline fragrance for men since Dune for Men which came out in 1997. Higher was released and aimed towards a younger demographic. A couple years after this was released, there was a flanker called Higher Energy that was released. Sadly both were discontinued in North America in the mid 2000's, but are still available on Dior's UK website and online discounters. Dior Higher is a woody aromatic scent that is a very versatile fragrance for daily wear. It is fresh scent that is a bit spicy and woody. There is an interesting accord of pear and cypress. This is an easy reach for me when I don't know what to wear. It's great to wear at the office, or relaxing at home, even going out. I find the lasting power to be decent for a fresh scent. When I wear fragrances like this I am not expecting it to last 10-12 hours. It's a bright scent that makes me feel happy.

Higher is rather soft in terms of silage and projects just for the wearer and stays as a strong skin scent for a number of hours.

My dad bought it and it was his to go fragrance from 2001 to 2003. Since then I was in love with the scent, but it was later kind of forgotten when the Dior Homme line was launched. Almost 20 years later I had the chance of buying one of the first batches from this beautiful fragrance, the one I remember my dad wore, Aluminium bottle with the white plastic insert in the center. A very “new Millenium” aesthetic, which I absolutely adore. To me it’s exactly what I imagine a Dior model smells. There was I think this idea that perfumery, during those early 2000s years, was about simplicity and smartness in the use of ingredients. Higher is fruity, clean, musky…it’s all about the pear note, very realistic. Higher also has all the points to be a timeless fragrance: very wearable, all season, for every occasion but without being generic at all, you can over spray it and you won’t offend anybody and it can totally be worn today; all this is what makes it great IMHO. I haven’t tried the newer versions but this one has very good performance, projection is decent the first three ours, then in gets close to the skin, and longevity about 7-8 hours. Overall a 9/10', ""🤔 Higher eau de toilette was one of my favorite fragrances from the house of Dior. Except it doesn't last long on the skin after two hours it's completely gone from my skin. Dior needs to bring this one back except in a eau de parfum consentration but, this time with longer staying power. Last time I tried to buy this bottle online I found out the house of Dior stoped making many years ago or at least you can't find a brand new bottle here in the states.🤭"", 'Oh I do love the original version of Higher and that funky metal flacon.  They really should’ve kept that.  It was as distinctive and iconically millennial as Rush for Men’s white plastic box.  In my mind it is a memory trigger forever associated with the first years of the new millennium. Fresh, crisp, optimism.', ""I'm really surprised by how much I ended up liking this. The majority of the time I go back to older fragrances that are beloved, I see why people have grown attached to them and have strong positive feelings for them but I find that a lot of the time the DNA is just a bit old-hat and that there are more exciting avenues to explore but with this one...it's just so good. It's beyond reproach. Chanel and Dior are of course the top of the pyramid as far as designers so I shouldn't be too surprised but I don't think this has lost any luster. Can easily be a signature scent for office or casual. Incredibly handsome and natural smelling. Edit: Too funny...I just looked at the notes after writing this and I just assumed the fruit here was melon. Like cantaloupe to be exact. It says peach, pear and lemon. I get cantaloupe, basil and musk."", ""Like a mix of CK Truth Men and Ralph Lauren Romance for Men with more emphasis on fruits.

If you enjoy pear fragrances, or would like to give one a try and enjoy versatile safe clean scents that are fresh and masculine i highly reccomend. If there is only one downside i can think of, it would be that i have not heard this before but i can imagine it may come off a bit harsh to sensitive noses, but because it is not crazy strong i think that problem can be easily avoided by just not overspraying :)!.', ""A blind-buy based on reviews, This is a great scent from Dior.

Higher and Acqua Di Gio were my first five fragrances and what got me hooked.  I loved Higher more than ADG however. Such a wonderful spring/summer fragrance.  Around that time, I started impulse buying fragrances at the malls and I owned around 15-20 in a matter of a few years.  So why is that relevant? With 15+ fragrances that I’ve owned, Higher is one of two fragrances that I actually managed to empty. I sprayed it so damn much because it smelled so good to me. I’d pick this over anything else at that time.  Not sure what it’s like now. The scent was great. I’m sure the longevity is horrendous by now. Considering it must’ve been reformulated countless of times.  I’d say it’s a great blind buy for 18-30 years. It’s cheap and smells good. Good for people just getting started with the frag game I’d say.', 'Acqua Di Gio with a better herbal opening and pearwood mid. Make no mistake, this fragrance is driven by calone but Dior isnt going to give that away in a note pyramid. Smells great, short lengevity.', ""What a joyful scent. It smells reminiscent of something I know but can't really put my finger on what exactly that is. It's definitely got that Dior quality and signature you smell in all of their fragrances. Maybe I'm just nostalgic and this sounds subjective or like a cliché, but everything in all domains was better back in the days. Music, films, clothes, and quality of life in general. Scents too. Now I really want to smell Higher Energy and I think I'll blind buy it next summer."", ""A very light and fresh, summer/spring fragrance with very moderate projection and low duration, but nice nonetheless. I get a very sharp anise opening that fades quickly into some woody fragrance which incredibly fades into a sweet layer of peach or melon and a very present ambergris that gives it some tingle on the nose (most probably ambroxan).  I think it's the inspiration for this year's YSL Y Eau De Parfum, but with a less sharp ambergris than this one, as it has very similar notes. I'm rediscovering this one totally by chance, as I've found a half full aluminium bottle from the original 2001 edition in an old cabinet in my house which was forgotten or misplaced or go figure how it ended there. I wasn't much into frags back then so I didn't pay too much attention to it being missing but I'm glad to have found it back. As other reviewers have said, performance is meh at best, 2 hrs to turn into a skin scent, needs some overspraying to get more out of it. Need to retest it properly on clothes. Wouldn't buy it again, so glad I have still half a bottle to burn."", ""maybe the most easygoing, effortless, relaxing dior fragrance ever. higher opens with peach and pear, then cedar, musk and a very nice cyrpess are more prominent in the drydown. a fresh-woody smell, a bit sour, very clean and pleasant. in the summer is a great pick, it gives to you an uplifting, invigorating sensation with the class and quality of dior. i would like to drink this juice! on the other hand the price and the performance are not so good. i found a vintage, brand-new 100ml bottle for 30euro in a local store, because they are selling out all the stock of dior higher(it didnt sell good where i live in). so im happy for this bargain, but i cant recommed it with the full price. in my opinion u can turn to dunhill icon, it doesnt have the quality of higher but it smells very good, the performance is better and the price is cheap. the longevity and sillage are absolutely below average. it's a shame because i love the smell, really. for 25 and up, for warm seasons, daytime, casual situations and office. un profumo fresco, rinvigorente, con la qualità di dior. peccato che la performance sia pessima. scent-8 long-5,5 sillage-5,5 uniqueness-7,5 bottle-6 versatility-8,5 compliment factor-7 rebuy?no my vote-7,5 in one word- easygoing the review is based on a vintage bottle. dont know if the clear bottle is a reformulation and if higher is discontinued."", 'I smell liqourice and chlorinated pool. Greenish and a bit woody.', ""It is undoubtedly a very natural, fresh and clean scent, but it's a bit TOO light in my opinion. The performance also leaves much to be desired (skin scent after 3 hours). The smell reminds me of a luxurious bar of soap from an upscale hotel. It's a minimalist fragrance. I can understand the comparisons to the color white and the season of spring/summer. One thing that this fragrance has going for it, is that it's a counterpart to popular synthetic ambroxan bombs like Dylan Blue, YSL Y EDP, Code Colonia and Sauvage.

LOVE LOVE', ""Higher was one of my favourites in the noughties, it was the first masculine perfume released under Slimane's era, targetted to a young, fresh, minimal and urban audience. I have taken longer than 15 years to repurchase a vintage aluminium bottle, and well, it is still an interesting fragrance, an unusual fruity masculine with an spicy-green character... but after this time something in its formula puts me off... Several months wearing it and now I know it is due to the peach note, totally out of control, rottenly sweet, even uncapable to be balanced by the plethora of green and spicy notes: basil, rosemary, cypress, cold spices. Still the fruity and woody pear accords are memorable and overall this fragrance is one of a kind so I cannot stop thinking if that peach note is responsible of Higher's not being the great classic it should be. I have also checked the new crystal bottles now in stores and the feeling is exactly the same: a Higher fall from grace. Ignore my opinion anyway... run to experience Higher for yourself before it is too late."", ""I heart Dior Higher. love love love love absolutely adore love this cologne definitely in my top five.

I like it, and although the duration is correct has a great against, in this case the projection that is very weak, rather it seems a scent skin and it dazzles quite a bit, since it soon becomes very stuck to skin and for the price it has I find nothing in proportion.

Its little feminine side added to your manly scent acts as a head turner for girls. Other men ignore this scent in shops since it has a little feminine scent.

It's one of those Dior fragrances that are often kept in the dark. Dior Higher just needs more recognition, more fans to come forward and speak of their love for it.

Think of a toned and tanned male swimmer; the faint smell of chlorine lingering on his skin, intermingling with the scent of his fruity hair gel and smeared sunscreen, and there you have Higher.  Pear is not a note you smell a lot of in masculine fragrances. I'm quite enjoying this unique, fruity spin on things. If I were to describe Dior Higher in fragrance terms, it's a slightly clean and fruity scent, with an odd oceanic and herbaceous approach. When you first spray Dior Higher, you think you've got it all figured out. In the initial stages it may strike you as bland and insipid, but do wait it out. Dior Higher gets better as the fragrance progresses. It has an alluring heart of rosemary, peach, pear, cypress and basil, which can't be explained in words, it has to be smelt. Dior Higher is really quite complex, which was not what I expected to find in such a boring bottle as this one. It's a fantastic, fresh daytime scent, which to my nose, stands out a mile from other citrus based colognes on the market today. It's hard to categorize Dior Higher, as it is clean, aromatic, herbaceous, aquatic, fruity, citrusy and woodsy all rolled into one. I urge every man to give it a whirl, as you may be pleasantly surprised."", 'How do they do it, man? How? :)) Dior is the best. every Dior fragrance is perfect on my skin.  Higher is very fresh/sexy/playfull/fun. I get pear a lot, which I love in the begining and it after an hour or two i get something woody. longevity =about 6 hours on me.', 'its a good one, this is a nice fragrance for the summer. smells clean i get a lot of compliments with this one', ""first time i smelled this, i thoght of pear juice, and it's nice. after few minutes (5-10) spices and in the end, some woods. Very nice, if u see it on stores, try it."", ""the only cologne ive bought 3 times. when i was younger this was my signature scent. till this day it still amazes me and reminds me of my teenage days in high school. only of the best fruity men's cologne that is not too fruity and not too musky....just the right balance. i fucking love this one till this day."", ""I bought this way back in 2000 simply because I like the architectural design of the bottle. (Bottle? Please don't mind on my vocabulary) The scent? Pear at its best. You could smell the pear notes along with aromatics especially basil with subtle rosemary notes. It's very fresh, light and airy. Nothing smells synthetic at all.  I dare say that Higher has the weakest silage compared to all other Dior perfumes, but it's longevity is great. It lasts for 10+hr on my skin. I have purchased another 100ml in 2012, the juice is now in a clear glass bottle, just like Higher Energy."", ""This smells very much of cypress at first, quite harshly green, but after a while, quite a longtime, it does evolve dramatically and does smell very sipcy, although by then it is much softer (less strong) than in the opening. I do not like the opening nor the first two hours more or less of it, but do find the spicy drydown quite interesting, because as for male scents I do prefer oriental and spicy scents. This scent's best quality is from my viewpoint the progression. Overall, nevertheless, it is far from being one of my favourites, and I actually do not appreciate it that much because of the green conipherous theme which does not appeal to my taste."", ""Good thing i still got a tester for this one. Classic and with Outstanding type of fragrance. The only problem is longevity maybe 2 to 4 hours and stays close to the skin. But hey, it's from the house of Christian Dior which i love the most."", 'One of the best ever i had in my life. I still remember a middle aged woman who was actually quite shy saying me that you smell gorgeous. Just wanted to run away from the shop.lol.', 'A light but very persistant smell. Delicate and flowery and almost too feminine to my nose now. I bought this in my twenties and it fell out of use. Not offensive since its subtle but I found since its so light it is easy to over do-it, the projection is rather good. I regifted the cologne but kept the bar soap, which is a nice change up for business suits and the like, when wearing cologne would not be appropriate.', 'Higher Dior perfume is a very fresh and fruity, pear on all but a good dose of citrus very energetic, captures what this fragrance is a great feeling clean, but we are still far from Prada Homme. It also seems to capture a vague note of incense, although there is, the arc of the fragrance unfolds without major upheavals, but keeping intact its unique fresh spring between gusts of wind and the sun play hide and seek with the clouds , this fragrance can give the best average in the warm seasons and in my opinion can be worn at all times, see the stadium for an event or simply to wait in line at the Post Office. Good, but Dior has done even better.', 'A very young, sexy perfume for boy. I dont like it, but cant think of anything bad to talk about. Maybe it just doesnt suit me.', 'I had this one back in 2002 when it came out, i liked it a lot very fresh very balanced, sweet and flowers for a man but what i remind of it a little bit too safe on the balance, i like those scents more naughty, this one is i need to resmell... to be continued', ""Very fruity scent here , Must be the pear -Its lovely ! and very unusual in a guy's scent .It does sit close to the skin on me but I enjoy wearing this one during the summer months .Its unusual enough for people to ask 'whats that your wearing?' & for that reason I keep it in my fragrance wardrode :)"", 'I was, quite honestly, lost in the gorgeousness that greeted my nose upon smelling this, from the sample kristo so generously sent to me!

I grew up with bartlett pears trees growing all around our house and they have a very distinct cool green woody smell, the leaves are bitter and you can almost smell when the fruits are ripe in the air; DIOR has made a truly wonderful perfume built upon a ""spine"" of all aspects of the pear tree (blossoms, fruit, leaves and wood)... I like ""fruity"" notes in perfume; but very often they get overly ""plastic"" (read: fake) or entirely too sweet. DIOR Higher is a very refreshing fruity perfume FOR MEN! The opening of subtle juiciness from peaches and crisp, somewhat dry and refreshing pears with a twist of citrus is done so elegantly, and the addition of warm basil gives this that summery ""leafy"" sun-warmed feeling.

In the ultimate drydown, the ""pear tree"" note shines, covered and shining with a dew of very clean and sparkling musk; as the greens and woods and fruits all settle into a perfect olfactive portrait of childhood memories, sunny spring and summer days and a line of fruit trees bathed in sunlight. The wind blows their shiny dark green leaves and makes them laugh with joy. I can almost see, in my mind\'s eye, suntanned young boys; hungry, but refusing to go home and give up any of summer\'s valuable playtime, leaning against the trunks of these trees munching on the fresh fruit...and then throwing the cores at each other, playfully, before running off to have yet another ""adventure"".

I tried it on yesterday at a local discount shop, where it was selling cheap. The packaging didn't disclose much, and while I should have guessed from the bottle which isn't really pretty enough to be a lady's perfume bottle, that it was a men's scent, I didn't put it together. I sprayed. It was a light and uneventful little perfume. Floral. Not a single flower listed, but it smelled like white flowers to me. The lemon and pear were certainly discernible. It finished with a light clean fragrance, not unlike a laundry detergent.  There's nothing offensive about this. I might wear it on a summer's day if I came across it - but I'm not a man, and if I were, I'd want something that smelled a bit more masculine."", 'Dior Higher ....

With a real EDP concentration, this perfume would be a winner. The way this scent is marketed, longevity lasts up to 3~3.5 hours and sillage is no bigger than an arm\'s length. - It\'s very versatile, but bear in mind its low performance. It is unmistakably a fresh spicy fragrance with citrus notes and green herbs accords. Sweetness? None whatsoever! - The bottle is not pretty but it\'s also not tacky. And it even comes with a real wooden cap. My opinion: I always like to have an EDC at hand and I do own quite a few.

As it settles, a hint of lavender, cardamom, and ginger adds a light spicy touch that keeps it interesting. The base of white musk, sandalwood, and cedar brings it all together with a smooth, warm finish. It’s simple, versatile, and great for everyday wear, whether it’s for work, casual outings, or even a date. Reliable and wearable, it’s a solid, affordable choice when you want something fresh, clean, and woody without overthinking it.', ""If you're a fan of freshies you need to try this!

Citrus in the opening, rice and vetiver in the heart and soft woods and vetiver as a solid base. I don't get any savoury touches which some have mentioned. It is nice, not overly complex and many other similar fragrances are still fighting for attention in a saturated market. It is soft, but somehow longer lasting. You don't smell a lot......but it is there. A nice and honest freshie with a rice twist."", ""Fresh, pleasant, citrusy & clean opening. Then the dry down turns into a bit of a stale BO on my skin without any sweating. Maybe it's just negative reaction with my own skin chemistry it's a safe enough blind buy but i suggest to try on your own skin first before you buy. Performance isn't that bad maybe up to 5-6 hours tops then turns to that BO skin scent.

This is a green, herbal, slightly spicy and woody offering. It's very different from your average fresh scent but it's right up my alley so this goes down as a win for me. It certainly left a good impression on the Mrs with the first spray.

The hunt for hidden gems that deliver high value for low cost is a worthwhile quest I enjoy embarking on. Repeatedly.  Enter Lanvin Oxygene Homme. As far as fragrances that can be had for under $20 USD, Oxygene deserves a closer look. Far from perfect, it still offers a potential value proposition for those who are looking for something fresh while eschewing the familiar men's blue and aquatic tropes.  The opening is sharp, synthetic, and veers into laundry detergent territory, and made me think I made a mistake picking this up. Thankfully, the sharpness smooths out somewhat within about 15 minutes, which seems to be common for a lot of budget fragrances. Ignore the top notes, and soon the evergreen notes start to intermingle with vague herbal freshness, and the cedar musk base.  I think the heart and base notes of this one smell quite good, but unfortunately the only real projection I get is from the top notes that I don't love. As it dries down, it quickly becomes a skin scent. By the final drydown, the particular musk and cedar combo approaches a mundane greatness. Even if it is not going to blow your mind - the simplicity is what succeeds here. I wish the sharper top and mid notes would have been toned down, improved, or left out completely. The base notes that linger are where this smells the best.  This could be a dumb reach for me on hot and humid days where I want a close skin scent, that smells fresh, unobtrusive (after the drydown) and subtly delivers some forest-y notes in the context of a Y2K style freshie. I think the Oxygene title here is fitting, and I don't really get much marine or obvious aquatic notes here.  Sel Marin is in a completely different ballpark, as that's actually seaweedy and aquatic, and is higher quality all around. Same for Bvlgari Aqua, although that is also a step down from Sel Marin, but above Oxygene in quality.  This actually plays more in the same ballpark as Azzaro Chrome Aqua, or maybe Davidoff Horizon, even if they don't smell alike side by side, the combo of cheap price points and mash up of obviously synthetic accords balanced with natural touchpoints makes them cousins in the land of fresh cheapies. All of them ever so slightly dip their toes outside the box, but are ultimately constrained by what I assume are low cost materials. Worth a pick up if you can keep your expectations neutral to low, and want some forest adjacent notes packaged in what is overall a generic (by design?) office/close quarters friendly spring/summer scent. Ultimately, there are some sharper, synthetic feeling notes to this keep it from a love, but there is enough to like here to hold on to my bottle and see if oxidation causes any favorable maturation of the scent. Oxygene has an interesting concept, and nearly succeeds in nailing a wonderful scent experience out of it, but ends up only competing in the lower price points rather than transcending it's cheap price."", 'This is a Wonderful Scent, Fresh, Crisp, Green, Herbal, Airy and Unique. It reminds me of Forest, Jungle and their Trees, lakes . It opens up with a bit sharp fresh spicy, green and spices notes in the background then dry down is Earthy, Musky and Woody. If you like a fresh spicy perfume with Unique note and style, You will like this one. It has a very unique composition and A masterful Well-blended. Longevity is good, I really enjoy it when the weather is warm. Highly Recommended.  Thumbs Up.  Rating : 8 / 10', ""I'm not a fan of aquatic fragrances, but this certainly isn't a typical aquatic. It starts off with a scent that has a green, salad-like quality, but within a short period of time there is that cold air element, which dominates the dry down. The green elements are still present but in the background. Interestingly, i never get a clear wood note here. Overall, this is quite interesting, and I am happy to own a bottle, though that is only because I found one in a bargain bin. I would not pay full price for this because I am not a fan of the genre and I already have some other scents that are in the same general ballpark. I would advise not to wear this in the winter, has it is clearly a warm weather fragrance. Longevity seems to be at least good and projection seems to be moderate, though definitely not bad. I think it's also worthwhile to point out that nothing smells offensive here, even though it clearly is not entirely natural smelling, it does not come across as synthetic to me. However, if you smell it up close, you may find it to be somewhat irritating. UPDATE: The far drydown is mostly a slightly musky cedar, which is consistent with the note pyramid. It's not just iso e super but instead smells reasonably natural. It's not very exciting but it should work well in warm weather."", 'Atypical aquatic cologne.  Fresh, camphoraceous and…vegetative? It makes me feel like I\'m walking in a forest / shaddy lane with lots of camphor trees and wet and verdant grounds. (One day during an interval btwn two showers I strolled along a road with lots of blomming camphor trees, the moist aroma of blossoms, trees and wet earth suddenly reminded me of Oxygène, though the latter is certainly a bit more complex.) It must be the combination of myrtle and juniper as listed in the moddle notes.  It\'s also reminiscent of dated cosmetics I smelled as a child (likely due to cedar which is prominent during the end). It\'s so soothingly ""green"" as the main accords on this page. People around me seem to like it. A very unique spring/summer juice that\'s not citrusy or minty. Yet it may drew polar reactions, so try before you buy, if it\'s still available. It\'s been discontinued for some time, just like its cousin Aquaman, which suggests that guys today are not so into this type.  I think it shines in late spring and summer evenings.', ""What can I say about Oxygene Homme that has not been said yet? I'm not a fan of this fragrance. I'm gonna keep this short and sweet, The presentation is great, the atomizer could be better but it works just fine.  The juice I got is like a wintergreen mint color, not blue like I see in most pictures. The opening is very sharp, earthy and salty. If you ever got a face full of grass and dirt and maybe a little of your own blood on a pouring day while playing football with your buddies, this is exactly the smell I get. that first minute is INTENSE to my nose.  after that first minute, the smell eases up and becomes a wet forest scent, pine needles, cypress, cedar and wet dew. like soaking wet, as if you emerged from a cave into the forest after the monsoon storm has passed. Now here is where it gets a touch interesting, the scent smells like a earthier version of Pino Silvestre Original for the next 20 minutes. but wait, this particular fragrance DNA mutates into a psuedo Pino Silvestre Original / Polo Blue combo, leaving your skin with a touch of pine and aquatics. The scent last on my skin for about an hour and dissipates into nothingness.  Not a fan of this rollercoaster. The scent at the end of its life reminds me of Polo Blue's drydown.

In 2001, Lanvin released Oxygene Homme, perhaps among the best of Alberto Morillas\' fragrance orchestrations. Both the music and the perfume are French, multi-layered, breezy, sweeping, confident, sophisticated, masterful, and both open with fresh air ""in progress"" (listen to the very beginning of Oxygene, to hear my reference to ""in progess""). They both subtly reveal an increased sense of richness with each subsequent listening/wearing, which engenders an enlarging sense of appreciation for their greatness over time. Perhaps most valuable of all, they both avoid trendy fashion; they are both timeless classics.', ""No vetiver in the pyramid? Maybe it's the wormwood doing it. Could have also called it seaweed, but something green and salty is lurking in that bottle (the dill pickle comments below are funny, but kinda true). As such, I can certainly see the Sel Marin comparison although it's more of a similar impression than one being a dupe of the other.  There's this black pepper and cypress thing in the opening much like Jil Sander for Men but it quickly gets into an Iso E Super overdose in the vein of Encre Noire, Terre d'Hermes, and Declaration. If you know that cedary, salty, vetiver and conifer thing I'm talking about be warned or rejoice, depending on your preferences. It's intense.  I for one like it quite a bit, but be aware that I think Bvlgari Aqva, Sel Marin, and things of a similarly salty, funky variety are high art. There's also a little something of a citrus note in here, starting as a nice bergamot but developing into something more like a salted lime before a tequila shot.

Affordable, so you can go completely crazy with it. Not overtly projecting, so nobody will think you\'re trying too hard when it\'s only a workout or short-term, casual activity.

Oxygene homme opens very brightly, lovely & refreshing, before quickly becoming a closer yet still cooling light green scent. I first sprayed on a paper strip and wasn't a fan as it was too 'herbal' however on my skin it is far more appealing (if I may say so myself :P ) and nuanced. It has that special 'designer' freshness mastered by the perfumer Alberto Morillas in countless fragrances over the years.  So a good alternative to the plethora of citrus based warm weather freshies? It certainly seems that way. I urge people to check it out if they want something a little different but not too challenging either. However don't be expecting 'beast mode' fragrance as this is a subtle yet inviting light & airy scent but not without it's charms.  To be continued... UPDATE; low sillage and projection but quite long-lasting for me. UPDATE 2; I decided to move this one on to someone who would appreciate it more. It is a nice scent, however I like to only keep frags that I'll wear (plus a select few special scents to sniff now & again) and I just felt like I probably wouldn't wear it due to having some similar yet slightly less herbal fragrances which appeal to me more. I'll say it again, this is a herbal one (I was reminded of dill vinaigrette), it's not heavy or super strong but is a surprisingly good performer, or at least it was for me. I would say if possible try before you buy, even if it is inexpensive these blind buys all add up!"", ""First bought this roughly 10 years ago, loved it, found it fresh and uplifting. Recently repurchased it for old times' sake, not bad, but can't help thinking I smell like a bunch of chopped herbs just before being dunked in a good, hearty soup.

It's by no means a bad smell, but I'm not sure I want to smell like dill and parsley on a date with someone who does not cook for a living."", 'I was excited to try this and in some ways am not disappointed. The combination of herbs and coniferous trees is so relaxing and fresh. There is no sweetness in this one, so it all comes across as quite natural rather than ""cologney"". It is not an aquatic at all- I think the color of the juice is coloring opinions here. I can\'t see this offending a soul. Aaaand...that\'s the other story. Mr Morillas\'s sometimes achilles heel rears its head again: low performance. A few sprays lasted on my skin overnight, I can still smell it in the morning, but the projection is so very light. But as I think of it, a composition like this is perhaps meant to be ephemeral, especially considering its herbal heart. If it projected strongly, I think it would smell like a caricature of itself and become either cloying or obnoxious. Oxygene is the perfect name for a fragrance like this: imagine being in a forest on a dry summer day, a gentle breeze occasionally carries the aromatic scent of a mixture of trees, alpine flowers and herbs to your nose, as if reminding us that Nature\'s perfume is more exquisite than anything created in a laboratory.', 'Really nice herbal fresh green.

One may think that the name Oxygene can be interpreted as a scent with an aquatic character. What is really interesting is that Oxygene is mainly a herbal & spicy composition with an airy facet. Instead of a watery profile, upon spraying Oxygene you can feel blast of peppery freshness that will slowly transition into a blue hued woody airiness. It's the breeze in a forest, a forest near the sea.  I am reminded of Escada Sport Country Weekend, it has that forest airy character, but the Lanvin creation is more ethereal. It also comes across as a lighter minimalist version of Guy Laroche's Horizon. Amazing and unique, lasts on my skin for 6 hours and keeps a nice soft aura around me, perfect for the warm days of the Greek summer! Severely underrated, this is one of Morillas' masterpieces!"", ""On my skin, I found it very similar to L'eau d'Issey Miyake pour Homme. Like Eau, it is light, and summery, but while L'Eau d'Issey veers towards the floral, Oxygene goes herbal. Those who like L'eau d'Issey, but find it too feminine might prefer this one.

There arent that many fragrances that use the note, and I happen to really enjoy it, so I have experience with almost all of them. This sits somewhere in between Sel Marin and AdG Essenza, closer to the AdG. It does not have the darker woodiness of Bulgari Aqua, and it is not quite as salty and marine as Sel Marin. It is largely a green and ""wet"" fragrance, and is juicy and round. It almost smells fruity, but isnt sweet, and you can tell that its from the pulp of a fleshy leaf, not a fruit. In my personal opinion, the greens are very tightly bound; you do not get an obvious sharp ""pine"" reference like you would in Polo, or sharp ""juniper"" like in Issey Bleue. They all come together like a bushel of herbs. Very cheap and worth the price. This is a good choice for someone who is just starting out and looking for a unique, non-citrus fragrance for daily wear or as a summer spray. It smells apart from your standard citrus+spice+woody fare, and is definitely unique when compared to your standard calone-fresh brew.

Also, woodsy and spicy, if you smell it close to skin. But if you smell it at a certain distance, the trail is soapy. Also, it's VERY green, very herbal.  At the same time, the soapiness is a bit balsamic.  So: aquatic, woodsy, balsamic, herbal, spicy??  Plus, at times I think it has a vintage character; other times, I think it belongs to the 2000's.

It's just a great quality scent that works for most everyone, nothing wrong with that!"", ""A blind buy inspired by my affection for L'Homme and Avant Garde. However, Alberto Morillas scents have never registered on my radar.  The bright blue colour associated with aqua scents put me off a little. Marine notes are not listed but reviewers are mentioning them on Fragrantica, and it concerned me this is what I'd find. I tried Laroche Horizon (and hated it). Kenzo Homme I love and is a long-time favourite (but I don't perceive it as marine/aquatic). Based on the positive reviews on Fragrantica, having an open mind and a good online offer, I have taken the plunge. First off, Oxygene is a different approach to doing things. What I initially perceived as synthetic I am now of a different mind. I get the resins, herbs and the woods - just not the way I have experienced before. You see, this composition has no citrus and no florals - and that is quite unusual in itself. The opening is clean and bright, but momentarily having a strange almost stale note (like sweaty clothing?) Cassiano noticed it, and I certainly have. Thankfully, it passes soon enough. What remains is a fascinating woody resin. I'm presuming fir - because it isn't obviously cedar. I get artemisia too. However, its the fir that I'm noticing - but not like pine or Christmas tree. (I have to say, the room I applied it 30 minutes earlier smells fab!) An hour on, and I can tell you exactly what this scent reminds me of. This is taking me back to holidays in the Lake District. This reminds me of woodland walks around Ullswater (Howtown, Martindale and Sandwick). Oxygene isn't typical Lanvin. I strongly suspect there is more about it to tease out; after all I've tried it only once. It lies nicely on the skin and is attracting compliments already. Oxygene has proven to be a bit of an inspired choice. An eye opener. Quite simply this scent has got better and better. If I'm not exactly dancing in celebration, I'm none the less impressed. The dancing can wait. I'm just enjoying the moment. This is good!"", 'Now that my allergy to one of the components subsided, I can enjoy Oxygene in all of its synthetic glory. It opens with coriander, hints of resins, some vague floral and overpowering synthetic cypress - which resembles dill. I have checked my spice rack and the actual dried dill smells more complex and woody than this. There are also green aquatic notes in the background. Oxygene does develop and there are moments of brilliance when some woods and resins come to the foreground.  The drydown is less than a skin scent. It would be interesting to see the formula implemented in mostly naturals. Maybe there is a vintage version. As is, Oxygene is a wasted opportunity.', 'Clean, sharp at the beginning comes a little powdery in the base, yet fresh and empowering. As for me, drydown is almost identic as Kenzo Homme, very very similar notes, as well a little synthetic notes as Kenzo. Good price for 100 ml. Mainly a Summer fragrance.', 'Very Clean scent... reminds me of crisp air on a sunny day', ""Alberto Morillas is a genius and Lanvin was so fortunate to acquire his talent creating Oxygene Homme. I don't know why I waited so long to consider such an AMAZING FRAGRANCE. \xa0 After spraying on my skin I could smell the herbal/woodsy notes starting with artemisia, fur and cedar giving it a real attractive green aroma. I also pick up a slight spicy blend from coriander and myrrh. The base notes of cedar and musk gives it a DESIRABLE aroma coming off being very fresh and uplifting.  Longevity and Silage is slightly better than moderate lasting at least 6hrs.  Overall view, I have several Lanvin frag's....Oxygene Homme is one of a few frag's which doesn't have any citrus or floral notes and still across as a real aromatic scent which is perfect during the summer months. The spicy blend increasing the sense of a real masculinity fragrances. Ladies that doesn't mean that you couldn't wear it...I know more women wearing men's fragrance then men wearing women's frag's.

It's a pleasant blend of crisp wood notes, aromatic herbs and salty seawater. If anything could be described as an aromatic aquatic, Oxygene Homme would be it. I found the female version of Oxygene a bit more characteristic, however that's not to say that Oxygene Homme fades in comparison. It has a nice, clean aroma that will surely appeal to both men and women. The herbaceous accords in Oxygene Homme are so refreshing that they almost clear the sinuses. It acts like Vicks VapoRub without smelling like it. I quite enjoy this clean sharpness. Lanvin fragrances tend to get lost amongst other big name brands, which is a shame seeing that they produce such quality scents. For a man living in an incredibly warm climate, Oxygene Homme would be a God-send. Most impressive is Oxygene Homme's fantastic longevity, not to mention its bold sillage. This fragrance is still relatively easy to find, but I fear that this may not be the case in the next few years.

It is ok for a small period, but after 1 hour it becomes tiresome 1.75 hours - 2.5 hours - 1 foot projection. Linear 2.5 hours - 4 hours - 6 inch projection 4 hour - 5 hours - 2 inch projection. At this point the harshness of the pepper gets too much to handle.

The turquoise color of the perfume is exquisite and the modern design of the bottle too. But there's something that I don't like, and I can't find what it is. Before reading the ingredients, I thought this was a marine/aquatic composition. But what a surprise when I read that this is an herbal/spicy/woody. This is not a bad fragrance, very interesting. But as I said before, sadly something in this perfume, especially in the opening, makes me stay away from it."", ""There is something quite fishy in the opening i thought could be amber gris, but it is not mentioned. Perhaps it is what someone called a dill pickle smell. After that it becomes very comforting and soothing scent, stilll a bit salty. There is also something sweet I cannot identify. As much as I am very fond of cypress and pine can't get any of them. It is a very safe fragrance for very casual wearing,it would be too tranparent if it wasn't for the salty note. Nice herbal scent and very masculine, even though sort of baby like masculinity. Women must love it on their partners."", ""A few days ago I’ve tested Issey Miyake L'Eau Bleue d'Issey Pour Homme and it occurred to me that L'Eau Bleue d'Issey is very similar to my Lanvin Oxygene – spicy, fresh, woody, manly...long lasting and noticeable, but not overpowering - great for summer. So if you want cheaper, but still high quality alternative to more expensive L'Eau Bleue d'Issey and Givenchy pour Homme Blue Label – here it is – Lanvin Oxygene ;)"", ""Curiously, I get dill from this.

Maybe I need to study it harder."", ""I had Bvlgari Aqua Marine on one hand and this in the other. It's like yin-yang. Green vs Blue type of stuff. Opening is a really strong and sharp mint with spicy coriander dominating the woods. 2 h dry down is more pleasant, with fir resin taking over the show. Though oxygene is more of an oxymoron at first. It's like being trapped inside the core production of oxygene. You won't be able to breath in there I can guarantee. This scent might be light and fresh...for a forest!"", ""Nothing is as passe as the recent past. How as a young gun in the nineties we laughed at the excesses of the New Romantics, the absurdities of shoulder pads and overblown ill thought out glamour of the American soap operas of yesteryear. How we disregarded the power play perfumes of that decade of excess. And so: enter the light woods, greens and citruses of the nineties the Isseys the innumerable Calvins and, rather late in the day at the dawn of the new millennium this minor, though far from deplorable, addition to the oeuvre from the venerable house of Lanvin. It announces its already out of dateness with a bottle that appears as though it would be more at home on Jean Luc Picard's Next Generation USS Enterprise than on the shelf of a self-respecting amateur of the perfumery arts.  How strange and old-fashioned the brush aluminium effect device seems and who on earth would make a scent light blue nowadays (take note Gucci). And yet, and yet, whilst Oxygene will never set your great aunts tinder ready wood pile on fire let alone the world it is a workmanlike piece. The accords here are harmonious, the effect more pleasing than inoffensive and the sensation is of comfort and safety more than mere conventionality. This is a spray that will never extract gasps of appreciation or excitement from fragrantly inclined friend but may earn appreciation from old ones and questions from married women looking for something they will be happy to smell of a faithful husband day in day out.  There is role, and not an insubstantial one, for durable, well-made and versatile mixes like Oxygene and available as it is and very reasonable prices I would certainly recommend it as pleasing mood music if nothing more."", 'This perfume reminds me of Burberry Touch for man... its an OK scent ...for the price what you can expect.', 'Too much green scent at the opening but middle and base notes are amazing and last long.', 'Lanvin Oxygen is a very underrated fresh fragrance, As a fact, Lanvin in general is very underrated. I gotta wiff of this a few weeks back in mall at a booth and i loved it. Its very light and fresh. Great for those spring summer days for casual wear. WOOOOOOOOOOO', ""Got it today! Such a great concept of Lanvin with all the strong green herbals in the opening it starts somehow aquatic but this wil last only 2 minutes!then the middle part arrives super icy-cold but pleasantly fresh.  It remindend me as breazy as Leau de Issey but dont get me wrong i will develop more like L'Eau Bleue d'Issey Pour Homme because of the cypress and juniper stronger greenness When i smell this right now i imagine :  A forest trail hike on a snowy mountaintop on a summer hazy day where the wind blows thin air from the snowtops through the balsamic trees and bushes of artemsia,juniper,cypress,fir and other greens.Its uber masculine. Its almost balsamic menthol freshness for your senses as its will keep you alert throughout the day. The drydown soothes it all with splendid white musk and thankfully not vetiver (as always) This is more for the active outdoor people or to be sharp in office and definitely not a romantic night time fragrance (you need lanvins arpege pour homme then ;-) This almost costs nothing these days? All lanvins i got where cheap too bad for such a great house~they deserve better!"", ""I agree with dancinleroy, it's average, but good frag with interesting development after 3-4 hours. And it's long lasting though. Sprayed in the night 10 pm, woke up at 7 am and still there!

I'm sure it could be good for a safe present for a man in any age."", 'Good, average fragrance for me. Nothing special, but nothing wrong in my opinion. It kind of reminds me on opening of Echo by Davidoff. I was actually a bit dissapointed by the top notes, but after about 5 minutes it starts to evolve into an airy/aquatic, almost mist or fog scent all the way down to the woody base. The drydown kind of reminds me of He Wood Rocky mountain a little bit, but not as woody. It\'s definitely a light scent so it\'s almost impossible to offend anyone. I put on 6-8 sprays all over my body and still am transparent although I can catch a wiff sometimes, so I know others can too. It\'s at a cheap price, and is suitable for casual ""family dinner"" wear. 7.5/10 for me, only because I like potency.', 'Lanvin creates the BEST perfumes. This is the first LANVIN product I ever purchased back in 2001 and it is simply incredible. Fresh and crisp, it has a clean smell and not overly floral. Which is odd because I adore florals, but this fragrance spoke to me and I am so glad I purchased it.', 'This scent is very strongly dominated by conipherous resin in a way that, for a person like me who does not really appreciate this type of scent, makes it seem unbalanced. Nevertheless, the first time I wore it, I got complimented more than five hours after appying it (and only on skin), to my surprise, because I thought no one would anyway even notice it, apparently too weak, and in case anyone did, most likely they would not find it pleasant. Well, I was mistaken. It seems that at a distance the scent gets a slight soft sweetness that you do not notice otherwise - must be the musk. And anyway, tastes vary. I have the impression, actually, that there is something special about the scent, and I would need to smell it on another person, which so far I did not. After wearing it quite a few times, I like this perfume better and better and actually find the scent amazingly good, very special and sophisticated, a real gem. What I am not sure about is longevity, althoug sillage is quite good at least at the beginning. I will keep wearing it to see what happens. PS. I have to say that although I wear it now and again, because I have a big bottle and try to see if I manage to like it better, I do not really like this scent. I find the scent of conipherous resin too raw. It does not surprise me that it has been discontinued. Also, staying power seems, after all, and as I already thought, to be none. Alberto Morillas makes marvellous fragrances for women, but in my opinion his fragrances for men are not nearly as good.', 'Just bought it at a bargain price. Very nice fragrance for a reasonable money. Reminds me of Bvlgari Aqua Pour Homme Marine. Will wear it in spring and not too hot summer days. I really like it.', 'I like this a lot and it is great value. It balances freshness and green notes with a gentle woody herbiness, subtle floral-feel notes and clean pepper. It gets more musky later on and smells great throughout. Based on my usual 2 sprays - it projects reasonably well for 4-5 hours and it lasts for 8-10 hours as a skin scent with a tiny bit of projection. It is still just about detectable on skin at 12 hours. Overall it feels like a green-ish, gently woody, masculine aquatic to me. I use it a fair bit as an everyday scent (especially in the spring and summer) and will definitely be buying more.', 'doesnt last at all. Good for after shower', ""@ periquito89 No, it isn't just you. This fragrance is nearly identical to Givenchy pour Homme Blue Label."", ""I see that's just me feeling something that remembers, even a little bit, Givenchy pour Homme Blue Label, made, by the way, by the same nose. If you know Blue Label, Oxygen is a scent in the same way, maybe less remarkable in the smell. It is not strong, but lasts quite well. It's nice, unusual aquatic, but not whole unique. Probably it beats a good number of aquatic/blue scents around there."", 'Excellent and unique fragrance from Alberto Morillas. I purchased it blind, but with confidence after reading notes and knowing who the creator behind this is! I love the depth of Oxygene Homme - this is more than just an ""airy"" scent...way more. I love the refreshing notes of Juniper, Artemisia and Coriander on the top - a nice dash of white pepper, too. The middle and drydown are full of Cypress, Fir, and what can only be described as a blast of fresh air off a snow-covered mountain (not too ozonic - but clean). Wonderful fragrance - the basenotes for me stay very clean, but warm up. They are a touch of white musk with the crisp white pepper (not black pepper, or heavy) in the drydown blended with all the woods.  A must-have for people who want something that can be worn year-round and smell truly fresh - not synthetic. Cool Water and CK lovers can go elsewhere...this is a scent for people who appreciate something more unique and true to its name. Solid 4/5 on scent with a 3/5 longevity (this is a day scent and needs to be reapplied after 4-5 hours or so). Overall - 7.5+/10 and recommended, especially for the very low price. This would be a great everyday office scent or one to put on after a shower, or even before going to the gym. Men and women can both appreciate it, but it is truly masculine. Another great piece of work by Senor Morillas!', 'This is a sexy, punchy scent that lingers. I love it on my partner and make him wear it often. Always peoples heads turn at the scent.', 'It is about an extremely herbal scent. A delicious one! By the time I first applied it, I felt an alcoholic aroma, which didn’t please me. But it was so ephemeral that in an instant, it became a kind of wet grass smell. YES, that was my 1st impression about this cologne! The evolution continues and the cologne keeps the herbal aspect, very refreshing and a little bit spicy, with a hint of coriander. In some moments, seems like it have pepper in its composition. The Artemisia has its value, for sure! Besides that, it has juniper, myrtle and the fir resin, which gives a fantastic touch to the scent evolution, very well blended to the cypress. I guess this is what I feel most of the time! This cologne keeps a continuous freshness, without needing to be “aquatic” for this. It exhales well, which is very important to me and, yet, stays for a long time on the skin. I must say that the first impression, the first smell, it is not the best one, but giving it time to grow, the magic happens!', 'very nice but short lived. its not common. i gave a bottle to a deserving friend and his girlfriend loves it. he got married shortly after and was reeking of the ""new"" smell at his reception. so they really do like, and even i can recognize its unique smell. for me ts aroma therapy after a shower. and even then an hour or two of inactivity later hardly a trace is left.', 'It saves me in summer... Like fresh air or cold water', ""All I can say is that this is a very unusual scent. I purchased this from Amazon strictly based on the reviews. When I first smelled it, it came off very peppery. The scent was so diff. than anything I ever smelled. I just didn't know what to make of it. I ended up giving it to my brother. Maybe I should have actually wore this before I made my decision. I may give this another shot. What say you?"", ""I have enjoyed many 'aquatic' scents over the years, my favourites being Davidoff Silver Shadow Altitude, Hei, Baldessarini del Mar; but I always return to this scent and what I regard as its companion: the Rochas scent by Jacques Cavallier, Alberto Morillas close collaborator, from around the same time and with fellow characteristics. It's all in the tang!"", 'I Love this one ... so fresh ... so nice :D', 'Bought it unsniffed.

Alberto Morillas has better releases, but the fragrance is definitely worth mentioning. This is a light, airy and woody fragrance that is actually designed for the entire year with little emphasis on warmer days. It is not for seduction, although there are such elements in it (musk,cedar). It's not one of those before whom the audience in the hall would be enchanted! ;) This fragrance is designed for daily costume, and to get a nice compliment for smell which is fresh and pleasant. Probably it will be praised by the others (untrained noses) for its balanced and nice smell. What I noticed is that the aura is pretty strong and the fragrance can be felt far away. Over time it weakens and needs to be added more. I personally feel a touch of the sea mixed with wet wood which exudes a woody, fresh air smell but without the depth. Reminds me of the DSquared2 He Wood, just as this is the older brother. Ideal for daily wear... or, for example to carry it constantly in hand luggage and use it when it is necessary...just so that we can praise that we have Alberto's work with us.."", ""Quality *** Versatility **** Durability ** Sillage *** Top *** Heart ** Base ** Final score *** Minireview from a partial wearing, I don't like nor dislike it, not much else to say about it."", ""much much better than the female version -i wouldn't wear the female version, but it would be great to smell this on my boyfriend"", 'I bought this perfume unsniffed, and liked it, fresh scent!', ""The city nomad ventures through the early morning on his way to work.

What is really interesting is that Oxygene is mainly a herbal & spicy composition with an airy facet. Instead of a watery profile, upon spraying Oxygene you can feel blast of peppery freshness that will slowly transition into a blue hued woody airiness. It's the breeze in a forest, a forest near the sea.  I am reminded of Escada Sport Country Weekend, it has that forest airy character, but the Lanvin creation is more ethereal. It also comes across as a lighter minimalist version of Guy Laroche's Horizon. Amazing and unique, lasts on my skin for 6 hours and keeps a nice soft aura around me, perfect for the warm days of the Greek summer!

The combination of herbs and coniferous trees is so relaxing and fresh. There is no sweetness in this one, so it all comes across as quite natural rather than ""cologney"". It is not an aquatic at all- I think the color of the juice is coloring opinions here. I can\'t see this offending a soul. Aaaand...that\'s the other story. Mr Morillas\'s sometimes achilles heel rears its head again: low performance. A few sprays lasted on my skin overnight, I can still smell it in the morning, but the projection is so very light. But as I think of it, a composition like this is perhaps meant to be ephemeral, especially considering its herbal heart. If it projected strongly, I think it would smell like a caricature of itself and become either cloying or obnoxious. Oxygene is the perfect name for a fragrance like this: imagine being in a forest on a dry summer day, a gentle breeze occasionally carries the aromatic scent of a mixture of trees, alpine flowers and herbs to your nose, as if reminding us that Nature\'s perfume is more exquisite than anything created in a laboratory.', ""I don't know what to make of this one.  Every time I smell it, it mutates into something else.  I agree with MrMookie about the opening; the first time I sprayed it, for one or two minutes, it was almost aquatic. But now I cannot smell any aquatic vibe in it. Most of the time I find it soapy, kind of similar to Quartz from Molyneux (a perfume I don't particularly like). Also, woodsy and spicy, if you smell it close to skin. But if you smell it at a certain distance, the trail is soapy. Also, it's VERY green, very herbal.  At the same time, the soapiness is a bit balsamic.  So: aquatic, woodsy, balsamic, herbal, spicy??  Plus, at times I think it has a vintage character; other times, I think it belongs to the 2000's. So, completely lost regarding this one."", ""What can I say about Oxygene Homme that has not been said yet? I'm not a fan of this fragrance. I'm gonna keep this short and sweet, The presentation is great, the atomizer could be better but it works just fine.  The juice I got is like a wintergreen mint color, not blue like I see in most pictures. The opening is very sharp, earthy and salty. If you ever got a face full of grass and dirt and maybe a little of your own blood on a pouring day while playing football with your buddies, this is exactly the smell I get. that first minute is INTENSE to my nose.  after that first minute, the smell eases up and becomes a wet forest scent, pine needles, cypress, cedar and wet dew. like soaking wet, as if you emerged from a cave into the forest after the monsoon storm has passed. Now here is where it gets a touch interesting, the scent smells like a earthier version of Pino Silvestre Original for the next 20 minutes. but wait, this particular fragrance DNA mutates into a psuedo Pino Silvestre Original / Polo Blue combo, leaving your skin with a touch of pine and aquatics. The scent last on my skin for about an hour and dissipates into nothingness.  Not a fan of this rollercoaster. The scent at the end of its life reminds me of Polo Blue's drydown. It's not bad but its weak in comparison."", ""Quality *** Versatility **** Durability ** Sillage *** Top *** Heart ** Base ** Final score *** Minireview from a partial wearing, I don't like nor dislike it, not much else to say about it."", ""I've had Oxygene quite for a few years, I think I bought it in a discount store. The turquoise color of the perfume is exquisite and the modern design of the bottle too. But there's something that I don't like, and I can't find what it is. Before reading the ingredients, I thought this was a marine/aquatic composition. But what a surprise when I read that this is an herbal/spicy/woody. This is not a bad fragrance, very interesting. But as I said before, sadly something in this perfume, especially in the opening, makes me stay away from it."", ""Curiously, I get dill from this. And lots of it. Dill? Seriously?

It's quite surprising to me because before comparing the two I never considered Declaration to be as spicy as it is with cumin, coriander and cardamom.

Essence is however quite different, the spicy facets are to my nose more subdued and act as a transition between a lemon petitgrain top and vetiver sandalwood dry down. Petitgrain isn’t listed but to my nose dominates the formulation, bitter green lemony facets in the top however with an ample raunchy terpinic gooey sappy green facet. This ties nicely into the vetiver with ground Indian spices we already know from the original. The result is interesting, essence is significantly less refreshing and more sticky, less so the bitter spicy refreshment of the edt, and much more concentrated green woody spice and vetiver. There are times where I am reminded a bit of Thai cooking, in the the tart lemon facets blend with the spice almost like a ginger and lemongrass combo. I find the dry down a bit of a pet down though, more creamy milky coumarinic facets mixing in and evoking somewhat classic fougere structure.

The notes project stronger than in the original Declaration EDT, especially the prominent vetiver, which is why I like it a lot.The tea-note adds a special touch. Performance is better as well, though, the EDT is fresher overall. Projects a polished, intense, aromatic, invigorating, distinctly accomplished and masculine personality; very versatile and perfect for office and social occasions. If TDH is professional, DE is distinguished. I like them both.  This is one classy and stylish scent, and like TDH, signature worthy. I don't get any BO at all, it's just zingy. For anyone who doesn't have this issue either, this ought to be a top-shelf recommendation. I prefer DE over many, including more expensive scents.

From the atomizer (which is tacky but very high quality) to the juice and notes used, this screams a freshy that takes itself very, very seriously! There is no playfulness in this, this is a freshy still, but not in a gym scent kind of way, this is a freshy in a gentlemanly dressed up type of way. The moment you spray this, you will notice how great the atomizer is, and then you will be hit by a very spicy opening, for some reason, being this spicy does not really suit all age groups in my opinion, and the opening can be a bit too much if you ask me. The tea note in the opening can be dialed down a little bit, and I agree with BOish kind of vibe this can give especially if mixed with a little bit of sweat. This is not very unisex in my opinion, it is very manly and seductive, not easy to pull off especially if you are a younger guy, and if a fragrance can evoke a picture in my mind, this for some reason smells like a grey tux on a gentleman.

Also it is very unisex to me. Unfortunately like most of other new fragrances, longevity and silage is not there. If you like it then you will enjoy it and maybe another person who is sitting/standing very close to you. I think this is a perfect scent for mid-spring day time."", ""Very special. My first impression is WOOD. But it's enveloped in something fresh. Old school cologne vibe. Dry citrus towards Guerlain L'Boisee. High class masculine. Not modern, retro smell from 90s. Green with a mint type feeling in the top.  This is a bit challenging, not a typical run off the mill freshie. This I can see as a polarising scent that young people don't dare to go near. Myself I can't decide if I love this or if it is too old smelling for my taste. What I do love about it, it's DRY and stands for it. Reminds me of Dunhill Icon, Voyage edt and Terre D'Hermes certainly. Update: There is nothing wrong with this one but it does not wow or excite me.

The citrus top is out, and spices are toned down. It's all about resins, leather and cardamom, with a hint of incense. I see the original as a tribute to Eau d'Hermes, the Essence as a minor woody twist, the Parfum as a resinous leather flanker more distant than the other two. My preference goes to the original, with Essence as a close runner-up (these two would be hard to differentiate in blind test, tbh, for how similar they are one from the other)."", ""Declaration Essence from Cartier is quite unique to my nose.  I could smell tea, vetiver, and sandalwood. Tea note in the opening vanishes early and quickly. Vetiver to my nose is rather a top/middle note than base; it is barely noticeble but persistent throughout. Sandalwood also shows up early and is louder than vetiver. Declaration Essence also has a BBQ smell that I couldn't figure out. I wanted to like it, but my nose and brain kept on telling me it smelled like floral cedar flavored BBQ sauce.  Then, cumin shows up in the base. Declaration Essence has then been transformed from floral-cedar-BBQ sauce to floral-cedar-masked sweaty armpits in a BBQ kitchen.

That guy is utterly amazing in his detailed analysis of fragrances and I always try to read his reviews when I am looking on blind buying anything even if it is just a sample size of a particular scent! To nutshell it for you, if you like the original Cartier Declaration EDT but want something with a little more vetiver, musk and citrus kick then grab a bottle of Cartier Declaration Essence EDT and you will be happy wearing it for the Spring, Summer and Fall.

It's a skin scent about half an hour in. After about six hours you have to go hunting for it on your own body to find it but it hangs in doggedly in traces and elements for ten hours and beyond.  It opens with geranium, lavender, tea and a vague feel of citrus. Two and a half hours later the smell is the same but with the addition of the orange blossom and lemon. It remains that way but getting progressively weaker. I don't get any sandalwood or vetiver. I just get a rather dull, bland freshy.  The vibe reminds me of YSL Cologne Gingembre and Chanel's Platinum Egoiste. It's all just a bit office safe, not wanting to stand out or make a statement. I don't object to the smell but it's as exciting as wallpaper paste. It certainly doesn't smell like the original Declaration and it certainly doesn't have the flair of Declaration Cologne or the presence of Declaration D'Un Soir.

It is not often I run into a fragrance like that, making me pause to consider how I would personally rate it... There is something about the way the Tea note plays its part in the opening of this fragrance. It is a little too piercing and dirty smelling right at first... I am so glad it settled down though, because that was killing the fragrance for me! Once it settles down, boy does this fragrance really start coming together and becomes quite balanced. It reminds me a lot of Tous The Origin 1920, at least the way the tea and citruses play together. The bases are where they differ, Declaration Essence seems to go in a clean Vetiver and slightly less cloying direction, while The Origin is more of a clean Patchouli that projects a bit more. Ultimately, a well put together fragrance that I would say is pretty Office safe. Doesnt scream out at folks, but it is also noticeable at times. Interesting sprayer design as well... BOTH are recommended frags :).', 'Cartier Declaration Essence EDT opens with a moderate projection of citrus, floral, and sharp green notes. The opening is mature, elegant, intense, classy, and versatile. The vetiver, tea, orange blossom, lavender, and lemon are the opening noticeable notes. The vetiver is by far the most prominent note, it comes across a freshly cut grass, dry, green herbaceous, earthy, pure, fresh, intense, and sharp. One step behind is the tea which supplements the greenness of the vetiver with a slightly sweet, green, and herbaceous note. The flowers, sandalwood, and musk are two steps behind and work as support notes, the lavender adds a soft clean-like, purple floral accord; the geranium a sweet, warm, lemony, and green note; the orange blossom is a white floral with a citrus touch. The sandalwood and musk are faint notes in the back of the fragrance, they contribute with a pinch of sweetness and a musky earthy note. The opening to dry down transition is relatively linear, the lemon is noticeable during the opening but just for a brief moment, then the notes of the fragrance line up as described earlier and continue into the dry down. Once Cartier Declaration Essence EDT has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a moderate projection, intense green vetiver, tea, sandalwood, white-purple floral, and musky fragrance. The fragrance feels bold, casual, classy, cold, dated, dry, earthy, elegant, exotic, expensive, formal, fresh, grassy, green harsh, high-quality, intense, invigorating, masculine, mature, musky, natural, nicely-blended, office-ready, persistent, professional, pure, refreshing, rich, sharp, slightly sweet, versatile, white, zesty, and pleasant. BATCH REVIEWED: 2020 (#8HBE). WOW RATING: 10/10. A very intense and pure vetiver fragrance. DISLIKE RATING: 3/10. The intense vetiver, and a mild musky earthy note, are noticeable. UNIQUENESS: 9/10. Vetiver fragrances are common, the intensity of this one makes it unique. MASS APPEAL: 5/10. Vetiver fragrances are suited for mature wearers, not a crowd-pleasing fragrance. PROJECTION: 4/10. Moderate, about 4 feet around the wearer. SILLAGE: 4/10. Moderate, about 4 feet behind the wearer. APPLICATION: 4 atomizations. LONGEVITY: 6/10.

OCCASIONS: Formal events, outdoor gatherings, gym, sports, office, business, casual, holidays, vacations, clubbing. This is an office-friendly fragrance. VERSATILITY: 10/10. Vetiver fragrances are highly versatile, any occasion, any season. GENDER: Masculine. The vetiver is a masculine note. AGES: 30 and above. RECOMMENDATION: Cartier Declaration Essence EDT can be found discounted for under $40. The collection of every mature man requires a solid, masculine, green, classic, and fresh office-ready fragrance like this. This is a great buy.

The bergamote and cardamom combo is tuned down here and replaced by a tarry incense note (the same as in the bombastic Rien by ELdO). Later the surprising bit comes: the drydown reminds me of the old-fashioned spicy chord of Pour un Homme de Caron. It is a bit redundant though, especially with the Parfum version around. The choice is between the magical (and still the most intense) Ellena\'s original and the irresistible Mathilde Laurent\'s Declaration Parfum.', 'I just received an early version of this.

Ever since, I've avoided all its flankers at duty free, not wanting to endure a long haul flight testing a scent that had earned an ambiguous reputation with me. Wolfgang Mazrin describes a similar experience with Essence as I had with the original - that body chemistry interaction is noticeably a real determiner of how one gets on with either. Having read selectively about 'Essence' here and elsewhere, and discovering a good online offer, I've taken the plunge once again with this Machiavellian wonder. The good news is this flanker works for me when original Déclaration didn't quite. Bbjr (Dec 24 2018) reflects my thinking in that the toned-down citrus solves the cloying problem. If the lime gives Essence a sweaty, virile, body odour 'pheromonal' post-coital redolence; it's the addition of lemon that cleans it up so that it's edgy but safe. Déclaration Essence gets it 'right'. The subtly smoky tea and vetiver really works for me. Combined with the lime and amber there's a brooding atmosphere that evokes hot and steamy tropical Indian subcontinent hillsides. Like tea plantations, with their sweaty tea pickers battling the humidity and heat of the afternoon. Trying it, leaving it, returning to it, I'm perplexed how I really can't seem to pick out any of the florals. All I get is citrus and woods from beginning to end. Strangely, I want to believe there's cardamom in there somewhere. (It isn't.) A curious semblance persists though. Déclaration Essence is a beautifully crafted scent with respectable longevity and projection. It couldn't possibly matter which side one's preferences fall - original or Essence - the drydown of each is so similar. Essence gets my vote: a purely personal view on what are subtle differences between two awesome creations. Essence takes the best of the original whilst taming its challenging aspects. A good scent has attained true greatness."", ""I just purchased a full bottle of this and received a compliment on the first day. For some reason, this fragrance reminds me of Terre D' Hermes.

Very soon, though the wood seems to disappear and is replaced by very sharp, sweet, peppery smoke. And that is why this fragrance is a barbecue, or maybe a campfire. No, not *exactly* in every note, but to me it seems so obvious...standing there by the fire while the mesquite wood burns. That being said, back to the clear liquid in the vial: it\'s still sweet, sharp and peppery, and feels very incomplete, like a Demeter fragrance. ""Backyard Barbecue"". I think there\'s some sandalwood, and probably some believable incense, but I just can\'t make any association at all beyond Barbecue. If I could take this seriously as a personal fragrance for use in scenting my person, I would first of all debate whether it\'s too piercing; the sharpness, the direct and harsh sweetness, and the pepper might stab at other people\'s noses, even though it\'s not an overall ""powerhouse"" onslaught. I also don\'t see it as a room spray, because it\'s too close to the smell that I want to get off my clothes and hair when I come home after barbecue or a campfire.

After about ten minutes, though, it settles down to somewhere in between spicy tea and a winter forest. Towards the end of the day, it smells soft and floral with a hint of lime.

Generally, Cartier ""Declaration Essence"" is rather a stronger fragrance than a soft fragrance and I suggest to use it during summer and fall rather than during winter and spring. In summer this one might turn out to be the perfect fragrance for hot days and vacations. Smelling this fragrance I have to think of a wealthy and sophisticated type of man who\'s wearing a polo-shirt and reading a book while sitting in the shadow on a hot summer day.  I do get the tea, vetiver and geranium ingredients in the top with a soft orange blossom in the base. Although they officially say there is no cinnamon in it I get the feeling there must be cinnamon in it.  My advice would be not to spray too much of it on your skin since this - especially in hot weather - might give you headaches.

It can be flagged as a “classic” fragrance and it is highly recommended from my side. PS. I have tested Cartier, Declaration Essence - 2001 & Kenzo, Jungle Pour Homme (zebra) – 1998 in a single instance and I am quite sure that they are fairly similar but with my senses and in my opinion Cartier is a winner as for fragrance composition, lasting & sillage.', ""Someone say that this one would categorized as unisex so, I give it a try...then, I can't agree with him.

The opening is mature, elegant, intense, classy, and versatile. The vetiver, tea, orange blossom, lavender, and lemon are the opening noticeable notes. The vetiver is by far the most prominent note, it comes across a freshly cut grass, dry, green herbaceous, earthy, pure, fresh, intense, and sharp. One step behind is the tea which supplements the greenness of the vetiver with a slightly sweet, green, and herbaceous note. The flowers, sandalwood, and musk are two steps behind and work as support notes, the lavender adds a soft clean-like, purple floral accord; the geranium a sweet, warm, lemony, and green note; the orange blossom is a white floral with a citrus touch. The sandalwood and musk are faint notes in the back of the fragrance, they contribute with a pinch of sweetness and a musky earthy note. The opening to dry down transition is relatively linear, the lemon is noticeable during the opening but just for a brief moment, then the notes of the fragrance line up as described earlier and continue into the dry down. Once Cartier Declaration Essence EDT has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a moderate projection, intense green vetiver, tea, sandalwood, white-purple floral, and musky fragrance. The fragrance feels bold, casual, classy, cold, dated, dry, earthy, elegant, exotic, expensive, formal, fresh, grassy, green harsh, high-quality, intense, invigorating, masculine, mature, musky, natural, nicely-blended, office-ready, persistent, professional, pure, refreshing, rich, sharp, slightly sweet, versatile, white, zesty, and pleasant. BATCH REVIEWED: 2020 (#8HBE). WOW RATING: 10/10. A very intense and pure vetiver fragrance. DISLIKE RATING: 3/10. The intense vetiver, and a mild musky earthy note, are noticeable. UNIQUENESS: 9/10. Vetiver fragrances are common, the intensity of this one makes it unique. MASS APPEAL: 5/10. Vetiver fragrances are suited for mature wearers, not a crowd-pleasing fragrance. PROJECTION: 4/10. Moderate, about 4 feet around the wearer. SILLAGE: 4/10. Moderate, about 4 feet behind the wearer. APPLICATION: 4 atomizations. LONGEVITY: 6/10.

Vetiver fragrances are highly versatile, any occasion, any season. GENDER: Masculine. The vetiver is a masculine note. AGES: 30 and above. RECOMMENDATION: Cartier Declaration Essence EDT can be found discounted for under $40. The collection of every mature man requires a solid, masculine, green, classic, and fresh office-ready fragrance like this. This is a great buy. BLIND-BUY: No, sample it first, the vetiver is intense, also a mild musky earthy note.

Ever since, I've avoided all its flankers at duty free, not wanting to endure a long haul flight testing a scent that had earned an ambiguous reputation with me. Wolfgang Mazrin describes a similar experience with Essence as I had with the original - that body chemistry interaction is noticeably a real determiner of how one gets on with either. Having read selectively about 'Essence' here and elsewhere, and discovering a good online offer, I've taken the plunge once again with this Machiavellian wonder. The good news is this flanker works for me when original Déclaration didn't quite. Bbjr (Dec 24 2018) reflects my thinking in that the toned-down citrus solves the cloying problem. If the lime gives Essence a sweaty, virile, body odour 'pheromonal' post-coital redolence; it's the addition of lemon that cleans it up so that it's edgy but safe. Déclaration Essence gets it 'right'. The subtly smoky tea and vetiver really works for me. Combined with the lime and amber there's a brooding atmosphere that evokes hot and steamy tropical Indian subcontinent hillsides. Like tea plantations, with their sweaty tea pickers battling the humidity and heat of the afternoon. Trying it, leaving it, returning to it, I'm perplexed how I really can't seem to pick out any of the florals. All I get is citrus and woods from beginning to end. Strangely, I want to believe there's cardamom in there somewhere. (It isn't.) A curious semblance persists though. Déclaration Essence is a beautifully crafted scent with respectable longevity and projection. It couldn't possibly matter which side one's preferences fall - original or Essence - the drydown of each is so similar. Essence gets my vote: a purely personal view on what are subtle differences between two awesome creations. Essence takes the best of the original whilst taming its challenging aspects. A good scent has attained true greatness."", ""Who said this perfume doesn't last long & weak is really stupid. This perfume stand 12 hours plus on my skin & almost everyone around me can notice it. One of most versatile perfume in my collection. A review said that this smell like sexy man sweat. Well, you're on point, brother."", ""Very close to Declaration keeping the fresh effect but meatier. The citruses are balanced very shrewdly with a sweet-warm amber body odor smell present in the heart of this. Not overtly animalic so don't run to hills. Spicy for sure and smoky in a friendly way. If you are into clean (laundry type) smells you will probably be surprised. The rest of us can indulge freely."", 'Nice clean and soapy, barbershop esque fragrance. Not a fan of the original Declaration but this is great. Green and fresh and pleasing. Soft tea, pleasing soapy orange blossom, clean sharp lavender and geranium, some citruses, and a nice soapy vetiver and sandalwood base make this smell classy, gentlemanly, and masculine while being accessible and super clean. The vetiver in this is woody kinda too, this scent smells very unique to me while being very easy to wear, especially for a vetiver frag. It has a sweetness too somewhere in there. Just extremely well blended IMO and a great all around frag. What a banger this is.', 'Cartier\'s own website says: ""A fresh perfume, spicy and woody with the power and majesty of cedar, brightened with cardamom and warmed by notes of labdanum."" Printing on the back of the store tester says similarly. Déclaration\'s usual spice-cedar structure with a clear touch of labdanum are apparent in this flanker. And yet there\'s totally no cedar, cardamom nor labdanum in Fragrantica\'s note table. Notes for this one seem all over the place, depending on who you ask or where you look. Selfridges says ""Bergamot, Bitter Orange, Cistus, Pepper, Cardamom, Cedar Wood, Vetiver, Oak Moss."" At least that is closer to what the fragrance actually smells like. Nonetheless, hasn\'t stopped countless reviewers before me from miraculously smelling lavender or geranium in this due to Fragrantica\'s error.', 'It smells like you showered at a hotel (and used hotel bar soap) then hung out by a campfire. There\'s quite a bit of ""smoky"" and some indistinct spices in this, but not much to counterbalance. I can\'t detect citrus, though there is some kind of sweet fruit smell. I don\'t think the sweet and the smoke work well together.', 'The initial scent is of a very fresh, very pleasant, slightly unusual, but unusual in a nice way spicy aromatic, woody, citrus. It’s smells like a scent you could really like, but after wearing it for two hours the scent was almost undetectable on my skin. This scent would probably work well as a light, inoffensive, but kind of nice, daily work perfume. For me it’s too faint, too subtle, and it doesn’t have the wow factor that I’m looking for in my scents. Yes, the initial blast is very nice, but the scent doesn’t last long enough, so I won’t be investing in a full bottle of the perfume.', 'I do not like the opening of this fragrance.

I wore swiss army yesterday and would swear I'm wearing the same thing today...I'm sure comparison would yield similarities.

The blend of floral, musk, and woodsy notes (and “a hint of mint”) in Swiss Army’s Altitude is easy on the nose and will leave the wearer feeling cool and refreshed most of the day.

All these fragrances smell great, but it is nothing new. Altitude offers great flexibility to be worn in any season, any event, and will generally be unobtrusive to most of the crowd. Performance is average, perhaps better than average, lasting 6-8 hours at arm’s length and less projection. The beauty of the Swiss Army fragrances is price – all are fairly inexpensive. On a personal note, I do like the Swiss Army bottles – each unique and cleverly designed. Final tally for Altitude is 3.7 stars out of 5 stars.

The bottle is nicely made and has a metal sleeve over the cap with a band of knurling. Very rugged looking. Nice opaque black matte finish glass bottle. I would stress the green notes over woody on this one, and absolutely agree with the very strong aromatic quality accompanied by a fresh sweet herbal finish. It has a moderately long sillage.

Despues de un rato, deja un olor algo citrico, muy agradable.', 'Smooth and fresh. Perfect for summer and office use. This one really has character n distinctive smell. If you like manly scent like Aigner Blue Emotion or Montblanc Starwalker, this one will satisfy your needs.', ""I can't remember exactly how much I paid for the Swiss Army Altitude fragrance, but it was probably around $15 for the 100ml size, about 8 years ago (it goes for about $30 retail, but you can snag it for under $20 on-line). The bottle is nicely made and has a metal sleeve over the cap with a band of knurling. Very rugged looking. Nice opaque black matte finish glass bottle. I would stress the green notes over woody on this one, and absolutely agree with the very strong aromatic quality accompanied by a fresh sweet herbal finish. It has a moderately long sillage. For me, I can't see it as a cologne I'd wear for an evening out. More for a spring or summer day, or as a scent mask for working out. Does it smell like a military fragrance? I don't think so. More like a sporty active lifestyle scent. It's relatively inexpensive, and the overall impression it leaves me is that it's not cheap but definitely not pricey. Don't overpay for it!"", ""I normally don't like Calone fragrances, but this one stands out to me- it feels like a day in the snow, or hiking, in Switzerland, fresh, woods, herbals. Lasting, but not offensive, or heavy, fresh and distinct. A great everyday fragrance for guys who like a fresh scent instead of a crafted, heavy, artisanal fragrance. Very modern.  I would describe it succinctly as a breath of cold fresh air in the great outdoors."", ""This does not smell cheap, nor does it smell expensive. It's just a nice scent. Makes me imagine that I'm driving through Bavaria in a convertible. Does it last the whole day? No. I have not received compliments on this one but what I have gotten is females wanting to stand much closer to me. Occasions: Office, church, date hike, homemade dinner date, moto ride."", 'Refreshing..!! The blend of floral, musk, and woodsy notes (and “a hint of mint”) in Swiss Army’s Altitude is easy on the nose and will leave the wearer feeling cool and refreshed most of the day. I have four of the Swiss Army fragrances and all have that common theme – the fresh showered effect. Not a bad thing, but some critics suggest the need for originality. All these fragrances smell great, but it is nothing new. Altitude offers great flexibility to be worn in any season, any event, and will generally be unobtrusive to most of the crowd. Performance is average, perhaps better than average, lasting 6-8 hours at arm’s length and less projection. The beauty of the Swiss Army fragrances is price – all are fairly inexpensive. On a personal note, I do like the Swiss Army bottles – each unique and cleverly designed. Final tally for Altitude is 3.7 stars out of 5 stars. I would recommend to the audience looking for an inexpensive option to add to their collection, otherwise, take a pass on Altitude. A solid “Like” to the “Fragrantica Following”… Enjoy your day…', ""The opening = azarro onyx. 10-15 minutes later, it turns into a sage/juniper/woodsy aroma. It is definitely nothing special, just a run of the mill casual scent. It seems to last a decent amount of time... I am looking forward to trying it in hot weather to see what it does. I prefer the classic swiss army to this though. it's a cleaner, fresher scent. I'd recommend purchasing this if you can get it for a cheap price."", 'I love the Swiss army classic so I picked this up. Boy was that a mistake. The scent is different. Super super heavy on the cedar. It wasn’t for me so it went back. If you want to smell like a tree buy this.', ""MINTY-FRESH-SPICY (A SYNTHETIC MESS) Smells like mint toothpaste.  Off the bat you get a synthetic mint and sweetness (from the juniper) and then some spicyness like pine, stays that way throughout.

I wore it enough to finish the entire bottle. For the time, it was a year round fragrance living in a warmer climate. I remember it falling somewhere between Versace Pour Homme and Dylan Blue—fresh, with a subtle musk base note. It had a very youthful vibe, or at least that’s how I remember it, possibly because I wore it during my 20s. It was a commonly gifted fragrance, thanks to its being sold at Victoria’s Secret. I think the intent was for it to catch the nose of a female shopper and then given to the male in her life.

I was so curious and I wanted to give it a try, so I bought it, this and the second ver. Well, I expected much better! It's not off but neither what people are saying, IMO. I think there are so SO SO MANY BETTER OPTIONS! I also asked others, they all said it's not attractive. Not something they would compliment on. Just boring and make everyone nose blind. I sold it right away and I'm glad I did it. Maybe because it's been almost 10 years so it changed?"", ""Reminds me a lot of Versace Dylan Blue. Just bought a mini of Dylan Blue to sample, and instantly said to myself that I've smelled this before and have been rummaging through my collection to find the culprit; otherwise it would have driven me crazy.

Not that I have a huge collection,but I just don't think it smells good. The lime and cinnamon in the opening are cloying. It's very loud. Go easy with the trigger. You can definitely choke people out. Definitely not an office scent. To be fair, she bought this for me before I really started getting into fragrances, which was last year.

I also wore Eternity for a number of years. How did I not catch it? Bath & Bodyworks Noir and Jacques Bogart Silver Man Intense were listed in the “Reminds me of” Both are not at all similar.

Bought it when it was released and thought I smelled like the sexiest man alive. Not so much any more. I had this, ADG, chrome, polo sport, and Burberry in rotation. I gave this away to a local donation store (ReTails) in 2017 since I couldn’t reach for it any more. Great if you don’t have a lot to turn to, but it smells dated to me, even though it is an appealing scent to the ladies. Projection is crazy especially in the summer. Go easy. Longevity was good, and I’d say high school to 30’s can rock it. Not a manly mans scent. Very sweet. Too sweet for me these days and I love sweet juices. Evening and night time wear, day time it might be too strong unless it’s fall or winter.. Overall it takes me back, but I won’t be buying again. Not worth the mula, unless you really like it.

Very Sexy is safe and a good choice for wearing at work. The scent is pleasant and women like it. I wore this at the office for quite some time and the girls there seem to enjoyed it, I was always receiving compliments for it. The only bad thing about Very Sexy is longevity as said before, it fades away too quick, maybe 2-4 hours max. I used to re-apply this 2 times a day during my 8 hr shift.

There are Perfume snobs who hate every scent that is marketed to the masses, don't fall into that crowd. I have gotten more compliments when I wear this, than when I wear Mona d'Orio, Tom Ford, or Creed. Definately a hit with women. Drawbacks are Poor longevity, less than 5hrs, and only fair sillage after dry-down.

Discovered this fragrance from a older gentleman collection around age45 he didn't have many others but I had to gone out and get my own bottle within that week.

I originally prefered the VS2, but now find VS to be the better of the two. Looking at the profusion of citrus here, it seems it should have been a ""straight"" citrus, yet it is quite aromatic... This opens very brightly with a hint of sharp spiciness and some leafy greens. Sweeet and sparkly with a hint of rye-like aroma...yum! The heart is a superb blend of greens (bamboo:lush, and sage:herbal) and the warm smooth aromas of cinnamon and peppercorns. Very balanced and invigorating, not to mention sexy...The drydown is woody and earthy, but the inclusion of orange blossom keeps it sweet, smooth and almost powdery. There is just enough musk here to be sensual, but not too ""sweaty"" or animalic. A very impressive citrus scent, that\'s not watery or too aquatic or transparent. What a wonderful fragrance, and I hope they NEVER stop making it!! Sillage: good Longevity: above average Overall: 3.75/5 My last boyfriend did not like ANY colognes, really.

I originally prefered the VS2, but now find VS to be the better of the two. Looking at the profusion of citrus here, it seems it should have been a ""straight"" citrus, yet it is quite aromatic... This opens very brightly with a hint of sharp spiciness and some leafy greens. Sweeet and sparkly with a hint of rye-like aroma...yum! The heart is a superb blend of greens (bamboo:lush, and sage:herbal) and the warm smooth aromas of cinnamon and peppercorns. Very balanced and invigorating, not to mention sexy...The drydown is woody and earthy, but the inclusion of orange blossom keeps it sweet, smooth and almost powdery. There is just enough musk here to be sensual, but not too ""sweaty"" or animalic. A very impressive citrus scent, that\'s not watery or too aquatic or transparent. What a wonderful fragrance, and I hope they NEVER stop making it!! Sillage: good Longevity: above average Overall: 3.75/5 My last boyfriend did not like ANY colognes, really. He would wear them, get bored and then give them away. When I got him this during the Semi-annual Sale in a giftbox w/50 ml EDT and 100ml shave balm HE LOVED IT!

You can definitely choke people out. Definitely not an office scent. To be fair, she bought this for me before I really started getting into fragrances, which was last year.

I think there are so SO SO MANY BETTER OPTIONS! I also asked others, they all said it's not attractive. Not something they would compliment on. Just boring and make everyone nose blind.

I dunno what happened recently, it\'s definitely a recent development of the community that\'s spread like wildfire. I\'ve always understood what that\'s supposed to do. It\'s worked before, but I couldn\'t be arsed by something that obviously smelt like fly spray at the time. No I wasn\'t sniffing toxic sprays at the time, I\'m extremely sensitive to that shit. With maceration it\'s also up to your sense of smell to take some time out and revisit a particular frag, not ""just"" whatever bottle you think needs some time out for being a naughty lil child while you forget about it for a while. Sometimes it\'s YOU that\'s the problem. Yeah I know what nose blindness is, I\'ve experienced that before, but there\'s more to our physiology than just overused community terms. Because we change all the time. Fact is no way Mambo is all that masculine let alone that great of a bottle. Even Curve and Curve Crush smelt similar to my Mambo bottle. Insect repellant..! I can\'t be wasting my time on ""nice"" springy scents anymore because they don\'t ever promise nor deliver every time. They\'re Cadbury chocolate in the world of artisan made. I already have a bunch of favourites for that time of year, and for many years thus far. I wouldn\'t pay for it again to be proven wrong, but testing this is a no because it\'s not in the shops.

Great for if you are running errands.', ""I'm wearing my leather jacket and Mambo tonight!"", ""another fragrance that reminds me of coca cola being poured over a homeless man's bald shiny head, but accurate! notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, lime and caraway give the scent a unique smell reminiscent of the old time coca cola recipe using much of the same ingredients. the balsam fir, musk and geranium excel in this frag, too, as it leads into memories of your aunt's wooden walled basement with the giant box CRT television and playstation 2 hooked up. longevity is weak but appreciated none the less. sillage would be that homeless man i mentioned in the opening not washing the soda off of him and he's walking around in the hot sun all day, you would definitely smell and feel the stickiness without even having to be near him. call me sold!"", 'Buy it before Ronnie buys up all the stock', ""This one is a classic. I remember I got it when it was new, put it on, got a big bucket of popcorn and watched Super Troopers in the movie theater. The smell of popcorn blended in with the scent of Mambo and I was smelling myself all evening. Truly Mambo is one of my favorite colognes. I also regularly love Bora Bora. It's a fresher, fruitier, springier cousin of Mambo.  I had a bottle of Curve, there's notes of that in all of these scents, but I gave it away. I kept my Mambo 3.4 Oz from 2002, then grew tired of it for some reason, made it halfway through than got rid of it for some reason.

Upon the first spray, the opening had primarily balsam fir and some bitter lavender. The fir note smelled almost identical to the scented pine sticks that you put on fake Christmas trees. It smells like Christmas, but in a way that is vague and can still be worn year-round and surprisingly works as a summer fragrance. The drydown is relatively quick and is mostly musk, patchouli and then sandalwood. I feel the notes listed are accurate, but the ones I listed above seem the most prominent to me. The warmth and depth of the drydown is comparable to Calvin Klein Obsession, but instead of sweetness, it’s more woody but still has a very similar musk. The release date surprised me because this smells more like a late 80’s to 90’s fragrance to me in some ways. Probably would suggest for an older man. Unfortunately since it is a cologne, it’s very weak and only really sticks to the skin for a few hours, but for the price it can be reapplied as many times as needed. I wish they made it in a toilette or parfum because the dry down is really nice and wish it would project beyond the skin.', ""I'm wondering if some of us are getting different, inconsistent batches, because unlike many of these reviews, I get a super faint scent I can barely make out. Not even worth the $13 I paid. Nice looking bottle though. Will teach me to blind buy, even cheapies. Sillage is nearly non-existent after the smell of the alcohol dries.

Are they right? - is the fragrance a sex magnet? Does it draw attention? Maybe. It’s a nice scent, spicy wood top notes, with a lush dry down which is where you get the musky-florals. However it’s very synthetic; there’s a plasticy-ness element (especially on first spritz) which you can’t escape. That said, I’ve not smelled anything like Mambo before, and as it definitely feels a summer/balmy weather scent, I think it’ll be my day-to-day ‘to go’ over the coming months.

Speaking of artificial.... The opening is SUPER synthetic, and if it wasn\'t there, this frag would get heavy use from me. Still, the scent underneath is very very pleasant! I find it interesting that so many are calling it a musk/patchouli bomb, because I really cant stand either of those notes. To me, I mostly get a warm, inviting, sweet sweet cinnamon.

Purchased as a blind buy back in 2015, and my bottle is still 95% or more full. Primary notes in order are Musk, Patchouli, Verbena, Balsam Fir, Orange Blossom, Lime and Caraway. Definitely a scent more for the older guy. Very abrasive, ""in-your-face"", and tough smelling. Picture a guy in his 60s with the hairy chest and the half down button up rocking a gold chain, smoking a cigar and sipping whiskey on the rocks. As far on the masculine scale as you can go. I would almost say it reminds me of Polo Green but replace the Pine with the Balsam Fir and up the Caraway, Citrus and Patchouli. Longevity is fair at about 6 to 8 hours, sillage is strong.

It's classy, professional, handsome, manly, and bold. It has amazing performance as well. A bit of an old school vibe, yet still very relevant today. This is a gentleman's scent. Great scent for the workplace, business meetings, or even traveling. This is a workhorse. It's 'on duty' until I clock out at the end of my day. I enjoy fougeres very much.

I tried it right after trying Boucheron Pour Homme, and there are similarities as they are both fougeres. Despite all the citrus top notes, Mambo seemed warmer, spicier, and less fresh than you would expect. Mambo seems fairly well-blended (no chemical phases) although perhaps not quite as smooth as Boucheron. On the other hand, Mambo has clearer morphs while Boucheron is more static than linear (which is a great thing if you love Boucheron's opening like I do). Mambo is less youthful, for sure, and more provocative. Mambo didn't strike me as too strong, but you will get noticed. I think it's a good balance between sweet and aromatic, neither desert-like nor bitter with strong wood. Nice for a date."", 'Women LOVE This Frag!!!!!

Curve, Bora Bora, and Mambo share the same DNA, but this one has an 80s vibe to it somehow, like some light elements of a barbershop. I get a bit of pencil shavings in there too. The bottle design and the scent do feel like it could skew feminine’s or unisex. However, I think it can just as well come across as a pleasant-yet-masculine retro scent. This is a cheapie but unlike many of it’s other inexpensive peers, there’s no crude or scratchy drydown.  CONCLUSION: This is a fun and pleasant scent. I like it, but I don't think it's as good as the other Clairborne scent, Curve for Men. But it's a nice variation of that formula.  7/10"", ""I know I grossly overrate this one. My first bottle was in high school when it was new. So, there's nostalgia. Also, my daughter picked this out of my collection as the one she liked because 'it smells like you'. So, there's that. I do really like it. It is a barbershop scent with a Curve vibe. Yes, the synthetic Claiborne DNA is very present. I find Mambo to be versatile, good performing, and crowd-pleasing. It is well worth the low price."", ""It's too light and unmasculine, even the box and the shape of the bottle is so feminine.. I hate it."", ""Mambo to me is the Pabst Blue Ribbon of cologne. Yeah it's cheap, it's certainly not the best in it's class, and it has an old school vibe. The opening is a bit harsh with the alcohol but I mean what can you expect from a sub $20 EDC cheapie. Don't let the EDC concentration fool you. While not a projection or longevity beast it holds its own for a good 5-6 hours which is more than I can say for some EDP or EDT concentrations. After the heavy synthetic opening subsides and it starts to dry down you get a mildly spicy and creamy barbershop type scent consistent with many 90s fougeres. It's not as loud as many of those in that category but to me that is a good thing. It makes this very approachable and an easy spray for work as I know I will smell clean and not offend. If you are into only niche and/or refined designer scents, this isn't for you. If you are looking for a cheap no frills masculine, barbershop type fragrance this might be worth checking out. 6/10"", ""This is a odd one for me. I want to like it.. it's got a more mature vibe, but at the same time not so much. Sandalwood is so prominent. So is the caraway, fir and cinnamon.

With a name like ""Mambo"" I expected a strong spicy fire of a fragrance but what we get instead is just an average scent.  Mambo Cologne for men is a light spicy scent that maintains a slightly less than average sillage and longevity. It starts off OK with a shot of fruit and spice and dries down to a lavender smell that does stick around for some time. It is not offensive but it is too average for me. It may work others but I do not see myself getting this anymore.  Now of they can make a sequel called Mambo No. 5 I would buy that on the name alone hahaha! Guepa Guepa!  5 out 10', ""Hi there, I'm four hours in. Off one spray it's still projecting about a foot. Fragrance is citrus woody musk; linear from spray to dry down. It's an average performing 90's scent, it feels less synthetic than Liz Claiborne Sport did + Curve, but it's just about there.  It reminds me of Adidas Moves, Swiss Army original, Swiss Army Altitude all in one. I bought a travel spray for 5$ so I'm not concerned. It's a good gym fragrance, or work fragrance (unless you wear a suit), not offensive and very easy to wear. Casual and nice."", ""I originally purchased Mambo thinking it would be a Tropical/Caribbean kind of scent. However, it's nothing of the sort. It's just a clean lavender fragrance, smells like freshly washed clothes mixed with citrus and some kind of woody scent, sandalwood maybe. The longevity on skin is horrible. I get less than an hour and it's completely gone. Projection is 20-30 minutes. I did get much better performance by spraying my shirt. So it appears Mambo is one of those fragrances that works best by spraying your clothing. For $12 I can't complain, but rarely reach for this except maybe once a year during the summer."", 'For those who have not smelled this fragrance. This fragrance is very similar to the original Curve for men. Compared to Curve by Liz Claiborne. Mambo has more spices and is a little richer. Think of Mambo as a evening/night version of Curve. I personally like Mambo more because the spices are pleasant and it can be worn in cold and hot weather. However Mambo is synthetic and the bottle looks like a adult toy. Considering the price for this fragrance. I give Mambo a 7.5/10. Worth the money!', ""This is a decent fragrance. Pleasant to the nose as most Liz Claiborne fragrances are. It's a soapy, fruity, spicy, aftershave type of scent. In the same vein as Bora Bora or Curve as you would imagine. It's a little lighter than I like but very pleasant to the nose and original. This is something I would picture on a Limo driver or possibly a security card in a nice suit and handlebar mustache. It's classy enough to be worn by someone in the entertainment industry. I imagine it on an older gentleman who is somewhat smooth with loose women such as strippers and such. But that's just my take on it."", 'What a letdown!!!It is another scam of a fragrance,it has initially a nice vibe,but after a while it disappear and what rest is a synthetic smell that revolts me! 2/10', ""Definitely a barbershop kind of fragrance.

I like the spicy barbershop vibe and the longevity on me is a good 8+hrs with 2-3 sprays. It does sit a little close, but I like that Mambo isn't in your face unless you spray the hell out of it.

Scent:3  Longevity:5 Sillage/Projection:1 Terrible Unique/Industry First:2 Quality:4 Overall:3 This one is a pass. it\'s such a faint, light, meaningless scent, why even bother with this.

Even most of the Liz Claiborne curve scents are better than this.', 'I can see the comparison to English Laundry... a little soapy or ""barbershop"" of you dare say it. I usually don\'t like the term to class things as barbershop because it seems to be overly used for anything with a little lavender and spice. Kind of in the same way that ""just like Le Male"" gets overly used for anything with lavender, vanilla and cinnamon. This is a more subtle fragrance than English Laundry. In it\'s own way it is kinda like your grandpa standing in front of the mirror peeling that last bit of shaving creme from his face with Gillette safety razor and smelling clean. Yet it remains classy enough to wear as a formal fragrance. Longevity is good, projection is rather close and personal in my experience. It\'s not going to offend anyone when you walk into a room. I have to say it is a well blended fragrance, while able to sense most of the individual ingredients, there is nothing that sticks out to say it is too top heavy on any one ingredient. First spray give a bit of vodka or grain alcohol type of scent... not very becoming in its launch from the gate. But that dissipates rather quickly and you get a fair amount of citrus, lavender, and Balsam fir... later comes through with some cinnamon, musk, rose... and finally it really settles in to a soft woody, balsam with hints of cinnamon and sandalwood. Longevity 7/10 Projection 5/10 Originality 4/10 Value/$ 8/10 If you like shaving creme it\'s a safe blind buy. If you really like standing out in the crowd then you won\'t be impressed.

To describe this scent it's a slightly sweet, soap but also fresh and a modern but also classic barbershop type of scent. Out of all the notes in this I smell lavender,citrus and rose in this. This is a good scent but it's nothing great.  Performance on this is perfect ! With only 2-3 sprays it lasts 12+ hours and projects above average for pretty much the entire life of the fragrance. I haven't received any compliments but no complaints either. I personally really enjoy this as I love barbershop scents. Overall rating --- 7 out of 10 !"", ""Not surprising, this starts off harsh and rather cheap smelling (newsflash: it's $14.99 full price at TJ Maxx (and I got a large spray for $6 on final clearance)). BUT, its one of those fragrances that smells better the longer it's on the skin. And by longer, I mean LONGER, this stuff wears like iron, it lasts for hours upon hours. It ends up (as most on here say) like clean barbershop soap. Clean, lavender and uber masculine. At the end of the day, the stuff ain't all bad (if you can get past the first 20 minutes)."", 'Ronnie the Limo Driver on the Howard Stern Show states publicly that this fragrance can turn any man into a Don Juan oozing masculinity and sexiness to the opposite sex. Who would argue with Scores Man?', ""Most of my late 80's/early 90's memories are tacked-in inside this bottle. To me it symbolizes carrying out a mission during a warm sunny day while driving and listening to the likes of Duran Duran, tears for fears, modern talking, alphaville in a seaside location to reach LA downtown/New York City/Chicago city, when the setting sun aligns perfectly with the City's grid-patterned streets, creating a picturesque effect where the north and south sides of the city's cross streets are basked in the sun's light. This is the enormous effect I get by simply wearing Mambo By Liz Claiborne."", 'My husband picked up Mambo on a whim to try at Ross. As a bargain scent, we weren\'t expecting much for longevity and quality. I was surprised that it lasts easily for 10-12 hours.  Mambo has a sort of soapy, clean scent mixed with spice and woods. The spice is not overwhelming. The florals, spice, and woody notes are mixed well enough to feel more expensive than its $7 price point. The citrus lifts it up enough to keep the clean feeling going in the midst of so much. It really does have that ""barbershop"" type of smell others have mentioned. To me, it smells like a guy who is into grooming with a sort of old-fashioned feel.', 'I paid next to nothing for a 100 ml bottle several years ago. Back then I thought it was a bit busy but not bad. It just didn\'t go far enough in a direction that interested me (gourmand, oriental, incense, etc.), so I rarely wore it. I wore it yesterday for the first time in perhaps three years (or more). This time I detected a mild fougere element as well as a bit of dihydromyrcenol, or something with a similar ""fresh"" effect. There\'s also a fruity quality that lasts a long time. Otherwise the rest of the notes were difficult to detect, other than what I\'m guessing was a pine and lily of the valley accord that had a ""structural"" quality. Recently someone on BN said that women loved it, which is something that has been said about Sauvage, over and over again, and so I wonder who these women are, exactly. I\'d rather wear Carlo Corinto Rouge than either of these, by a wide margin - it\'s also got it\'s share of dihydromyrcenol, as well as possessing a clear fougere accord, but I find it to be a very good composition, quite enjoyable. Mambo is okay but I am just not a fan of the fruity quality, as it seems to lack dynamism and there isn\'t enough contrast. However, I could wear it once in a while for variety, but I already have so many bottles that variety is not really an issue at this point. Longevity and projection are at least very good.', ""all i ever gotten from mambo was citrus and i would have to agree with musicman.i dont get the cuban vibe at all except for the lime.my mambo is now doing the cha-cha with curve because i mixed both in one bottle.at first i regretted doing this vile thing to mambo but it actually worked.i'm thinking of adding tobacco now"", ""A sadly misnamed scent. Mambo is one of the strongest and most distinctive rhythms in Afro-Caribbean music, but this scent barely makes it past bland --- much more Muzak than Mambo. It's pleasantly citrusy with a touch of green, mellowing into an indistinct ambery background. The whole composition fades rather quickly, leaving only an indistinct memory of a rather generic warm citrusy glow. Pleasant enough, but highly forgettable."", ""Found 100 mL on clearance at Ross for $10 and had to give it a try based on it's comparison to At the Barber's, and I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised that something so affordable can smell this nice. I love soapy, barbershop scents and Mambo fits right in among the rest. It starts out as a light spicy citrus, then goes more soapy and floral. Mambo is not a thick, dark spice as the name might imply, but conveys more the image of a well-dressed gent enjoying a warm summer evening. So far I have seen about 5-6 hours longevity but hopefully this edc will shine more as the weather starts to heat up. Great scent, great value... clearly a worthy purchase"", 'what a cologne what performance what a price, always will be in my closet and in my heart, unsung rockstar', 'Perhaps the ""Mambo"" name uses the power of suggestion, but when I sniff this or even think about it, I envision a Cuban cantina with wooden floors and dimmed red lights. Music is playing, but the atmosphere is still somewhat somber. Yet, there\'s a ambiance centered on beautiful dark skinned, curly haired Latina in a crimson red dress dancing with a gentleman in his mid 40s. He\'s wearing a brown fedora hat and a white guayabera, paired with black slacks and fine leather loafers. His charisma is undeniable and he\'s also quite charming, it seems. They dance on a continuous loop in my mind, and each time with the same elated grins. I\'m not sure why I associate this thought with Mambo.  Anyway, I was a freshman in high school in 2003 and one of my best friends, who happened to be a twin, wore this religiously. It seemed that everyone within his milieu enjoyed the scent, especially all the females. I must admit that even I enjoyed his chemistry with it. It just seemed to dance around your nose in a delicate way. It was musky yet soft, warm yet fresh, robust yet subtle. It was a complete anomaly for me at the time, considering the fragrances I was accustomed to were Curve, Tommy, Chrome, etc.. But Mambo stood out. It was unconventional without trying to be pretentious.  I could never understand the properties of this scent. On my skin it\'s spicy, masculine, and mature. Musk is the primary structure of Mambo, but an integration of marginally creamy sandalwood and soft cedar tame the composition. The citrus heavy top eventually navigates itself into the base escorted by redolent lavender. Cinnamon then conceives the warm nuances encompassing the aforementioned, naturally within a synthetic context. Essentially, Mambo echoes the decadence of the archetypal masculine perfumes of the 80s and early 90s. However, it does so uniquely and coherently. I haven\'t worn Mambo in years and I couldn\'t tell you if it\'s been reformulated, but I remembered it lasted at least 8 hours and created an excellent scent bubble. Even my buddy always left a scent trail. My days with Mambo are likely parted, but I still highly recommend it to anyone.', 'I have a thing for collecting mens fragrances, dont ask why but I like this one it has kind of an aftershave/soapy smell that i like makes me think of someone who goes to church in a good way!', 'Lets say you are someone like myself who wore this long ago, or currently wear it. Its a masculine scent that projects well though it tends to bleed on the synthetic side depending on the wearer. Think of it as that smell you get after leaving the barber shop, its one for the sandalwood lover. It was given to me as a gift in 8th grade and I wore it through many cold Michigan winters until High School. Sadly I have not worn it since, what brought it back to my attention was testing ""At The Barbers"" from Maison Martin Margiela. The notes are near identical, but ""Barber Shop"" has no synthetic ingredients and a high oil content. It also sits on a shelf at around $175 so (shrug) you get what you pay for.', 'Somewhat similar to another Claiborne fragrance, Bora Bora but lacking the leather notes that give Bora Bora some depth and lend it a slight bit of a barbershop vibe. Mambo is ""fresher"" and has more gentle but masculine floral notes in the background and is also spicier in that ""fresh"" type of manner. This a very pleasant, informal scent that while not a magnificent scent one will be urged to continue sniff at is one which I can\'t think anyone wouldn\'t enjoy. This goes very nicely with Crabtree and Evelyn\'s West Indian Lime aftershave balm. Very summery! very friendly! Very happy! It\'s called Mambo but this fragrance would go great with Reggae. Big up man!', 'one of my favs for years now.. great juice.  Girls love it, it lasts ok, projects, and is cheap now.  What more do you want?', 'If it\'s good enough for Ronnie the Limo Driver it\'s good enough for me. Picked this up at Ross because as a Howard Stern fan I just had to try it out. Surprise! It\'s really pretty good...a spicy Curve that my wife absolutely loves. As a wise man once said, ""Every chick who smelled this - from strippers to regular girls - LOVE IT!!""', ""Ronnie loves Mambo; that's all you need to know."", ""Sort of a lighter clearer fuity juicy style scent, and more soft spicy dry sandalwood and things like that. Casual, but maybe more button down shirt, yeah it's not totally casual."", 'Starts out as some kind of fruity Hugo Boss fragrances (not in a bad way) but quickly turns into a soapy Drakkar clone and lasts for several hours with decent projection...judging from its name and bottle design I´d expect something more ""exotic"", but it´s definitely not bad - 7/10', '14.00 bucks I was almost ashamed to place it on counter , but from my surprise I was taken back to the early 1990s while in a bathroom stall snorting pure cocaine and being drenched with curve by Claiborne .....that was my mombo', ""This is a great fragrance. Bold clean and fresh in a different way. This used to be my signature scent in the early 2000's. Great office scent and compliment getter. It's different and a nice frag for the beginner. Unfortunately I have out grown this smell as I know longer make it a blind reach. I have half bottle of juice 3.4 fl oz. I guess it will sit by itself until someone wants it."", ""Very interesting cologne. Got a mini sample of this because I was curious about it. Mambo is a very nice scent, its just complicated. Definitely an evening or romantic fragrance, but I feel it is suited to a certain personality type. Maybe more for someone who likes Salsa dancing, open collar shirts, and gold chains. Very Latin, very machismo. Still though, this is an underrated masterpiece by Claiborne, and it LASTS. Plus its not very common and it can be found for cheap in discount stores. I'm now tempted to purchase a full bottle when my sample runs out."", 'I think this is one of the best fragrances I own. Just great.', ""great buy for its price.

I like it better than most $60.00 colognes I've wasted my money on."", ""Sorry guys I don't dig this ... Very synthetic  Then smells like a licorice jelly bean  Did I get a dud version ??"", 'This is a great scent. Nice fresh woods. last a long time on my skin and i get good sillage and a good amount of compliments. be very careful not to overspray this one as it is very easy to. 2-3 sprays. i go 2 personally. Neck and hair will get me through the day. i get about 6-7 hours on this. and with a price tag of 15-20 dollars, go check this one out for sure. pretty inoffensive and pleasant so long as you dont overspray. i wouldnt wear this in sweltering heat though. so a cooler summer day or spring and fall. wouldnt wear it in the winter as there are better options for cold weather. 4/5 stars would buy this again', ""The Perfect Cologne for a young man looking to Impress ___________________________________ Blind bought this fragrance based on reviews. All in all, not a bad scent. Starts off as a sweet aromatic, and then dries down to a soapy fragrance.  Perfect for high school, or even a college age young man. I would not really recommend it for anyone over that age. It's just a little...underdeveloped. Very much alike the rest of the Claiborne fragrances- sweet, soapy, and clean.  Spray recommendations- one to the chest, one to the neck, and done. Don't overdo it on this cologne. The purpose of it is to emit a clean vibe, without being overpowering.  This has no best season. It stands up equally well throughout the year, and could even work as an interchangeable sport fragrance. Longevity: 5/10 (4-6 hrs) Projection: 6/10 (Good for first two hours, then dies to a nice skin scent) Versatility: 6/10 (Great for young men- high school or college; any season) Smell: 8/10 (Clean, soapy, sweet- very pleasant)"", ""Shockingly good and unique for a Liz Claiborne fragrance, just give it up to 10-15 minutes for Mambo to soak into your skin before rushing to judgment. Usually Claiborne's men's fragrances owe much to Curve's synthetic core and upon initial spray, Mambo is no different. It's when it settles in that Mambo begins to develop a personality all its own despite none of its elements (individual notes) really distinguishing themselves or even standing out from the whole chemical mess. This is synthetic stuff to the core but unlike other Claiborne fragrances, Mambo never makes a show of being such. Instead, it paints a picture in broad strokes, leaning on its total representation as a rather inoffensive, pleasant citrus aromatic herbal with a hint of floral that doesn't leave much ground for development or evolution. Some of the earlier reviews are spot on in relation to Mambo's ability to rise above its rather cheap ingredients and yet still offer a very pleasant wear. The citrus and green top holds steady the whole way through and never really flickers out, making Mambo a linear but non-cloying experience because projection is rather subtle after the initial three quarters of an hour. A nice, underrated budget fragrance that can be had for around $10 for a 3.4 oz. if you look hard enough at a discounter near you. I didn't get spectacular longevity or projection out of this despite a lot of reviews to the contrary. In general 4-6 hours was the standard with lower to moderate projection after the first hour of wear.  Because of its synthetic soul, Mambo defies critical analysis as the notes seem to have been crafted as one full piece rather than a bunch of individual separate pieces that evolve from top to heart to base. Mambo is a sweet, citrusy, aromatic dust cloud of many herbs blended into a mojito mix before the alcohol is added. A good budget fragrance that also benefits from its incredible versatility for all seasons and occasions."", ""In my humble opinion this is one of the few cheap scents that is actually worth your money. Mambo is dark, woody, earthy, sharp, and mysteriously sensual. Much better buy than Voyage by Nuatica! The sharpness cuts through the cold weather and earthiness gives it a warm sensual feeling making this a refreshingly versatile scent day or night! (Although, I think summer nights hit the sweet spot with this one ;)  Longevity and projection are excellent too. At this price (no more than $15 tops!) you simply can't go wrong. Well blended and definite must have!"", ""Bought for $15 based on positive reviews and a crying need to add more heat-friendly options to my collection. Starts out with citrus/bergamot (not sweet), then a half hour later moves to lavender and caraway, where it stays. This latter stage reminded me of a better executed Sung PH. But though it's better, I still didn't like where it wound up. The combination is a flat, slightly metallic scent that reminds me of Tusse, the womens roll-on deodorant that my mom wore. Not the same, but creates associations yadablabla. I love the taste of caraway but it's plain that the synthetic olfactory version doesn't do it for me. Scent: 3/10 Sillage: 5/10 Longevity: 5/10"", ""Fantastic, classic, masculine scent that 99% of women I encounter absolutely love. It ALWAYS turns heads then the women walk over to me and ask what I'm wearing. I never tell."", ""The pyramid makes this sound like a no-brainer. Unfortunately, it's far too assertive for my taste. I can imagine it being perfect for the right guy in the Miami club scene. Just please don't over-spray!"", 'Classic very nice.', ""A sweeter,longer lasting, more complex version of curve, much like most of claibornes fragrances. It's somewhat cloying, almost in the way that claiborne sport is but it's not offensive. Go easy on the spraying though because it projects loudly for the first hour or so. I personally recommend it's younger brother Mambo Mix, as that is a more versatile fragrance and less of a statement. Either way, they both smell good, last long, and are inexpensive.  7.5/10 - mambo 8/10 - mambo mix"", ""Without a doubt Mambo is one of the most underrated and overlooked gems I've ever encountered. I cannot figure out how this fragrance never generated more buzz than it did. It smells unlike just about anything I've smelled while remaining familiar and cozy. It's warm and spicy and one might very well imagine the motif of a couple dirty dancing. Mambo is something of a kitchen sink fragrance though. Picking out individual notes is a dubious affair at best. Rather, it buzzes as a sort of singular and unified accord. Admittedly this does lead to a bit of boredom with the scent as a whole as it does not really develop or deconstruct through the entire life of the scent. Just the same smell beginning to end. But it is such an absolutely amazing smell that I forgive it for lacking development. Longevity is remarkable. I put Mambo on and still easily pick up on it for every bit of 8 hours and up. This might lead you to believe that it is a powerhouse and I would agree. Yet, strangely, with a few sprays it's always (and I do mean always) wafting up to greet you without knocking you or anyone else's block off. Any scent I've ever used with this degree of longevity and presence generally has me wishing to wash it off before I get a headache. But Mambo just smoothly reassures you that it isn't going anywhere soon. Sillage is just about equal to the longevity. You know where one that is wearing Mambo has just recently been without suffocating the entire room. It's lingering presence isn't loud but gently enduring. Nothing about the fragrance comes across as synthetic whatsoever and coupled with the 'throw in everything but the kitchen sink' approach is testament to the competence of the parfumier that created it, Carlos Benaim, an all star of the fragrance industry. I've noticed just about everything Liz Claiborne puts out, aside from the frequently lambasted Curve and the phenomenon it spurred, is overlooked. Perhaps it's fatigue from the glut of Curve flankers the house continues to pile on. But there's been several other very competent offerings from the house of Claiborne that warrant a second look. Spark and Mambo immediately come to mind with the latter being the better of the two.  By all means give this fragrance a try if you like warm and spicy scents. As icing on the cake you can easily find it online or in discount stores for less than 15 dollars.  Thumbs up!"", 'girls review: bought this for myself so many years ago and it was very nice, I didn\'t use much though and now my husband uses it. He has alot of nice scents but when he wears this i am always like ""mmmmmm my god what are u wearing?"" and its always this one! I think its one of my favs on a man. It\'s just perfect.', 'I wore this when I was younger, as it was my night-time, warm weather scent. Mambo also worked in the cold, if you wanted to ""smell"" warmer. Took a test of it after many years and found its not that bad. I don\'t hate it, but it is not really my cup of tea anymore, as I\'ve gone from nightclubs to more local bars or dives. I still appreciate the warmth, spiciness and masculinity of it, but it is slightly too sweet and jumbled for me now. I think of nightclubs in Miami when I smell this (probably because I wore it then). The olfactory equivalent to the young man\'s ""going out shirt"" (black button up). Of course I\'ve replaced my G.O.S. with a jacket, and so too this cologne. Still not bad for what it is, not a shameful option for a hot weather/nightclub scent.', ""I hated this cologne when I bought it, it sat around for two years, I tried it again, gagged and had to shower just to get the smell off of my arm. It's worse than an old lady who hasn't bathed in two weeks and covers it up with lavender perfumes from the 1940's. Seriously. Reminiscent of a nursing home bathroom, except it projects like crazy and has the longevity of a zombie. Expect it to be stuck on your body until you shower."", 'I found this at TJ Maxx a few years ago, and initially I didn\'t think this was a terrible fragrance. It just comes across as very strong, and for me that was more in a bad way. It\'s definitely more of a romantic fragrance, but at the same time, it\'s romantic in a ""gold chains, open shirt, macho, overpowering"" type of way that cloys a bit too much for my preferences. It also felt very synthetic, as if each note was intended to be over-the-top.  In short, wearing this is not a subtle statement, and you need to be the right personality for pulling this off. I just don\'t know many people who can. I ended up regifting mine. I could imagine someone from the ""Jersey Shore"" cast being among the few that could wear this and seem comfortable with it.', 'Very Masculine and romantic...there is something in this fragrance that makes me think of summer nights dressed right with a sexy touch (unbottoned shirt tree buttons) being right, in perfect shape with a gentleman behavior...thats what it comes to my mind.', ""When I first bought this fragrance I was nuts for it but something in my body chemistry changed and I really can't wear it anymore.

However, all I can say is almost every time I wear it somebody asks what it is. Mostly dudes though so maybe its more appealing to th masculine gender. My wife loves it too and that's a plus. I think vintage is a must if you are a collector.

A smokier take on D'Orsay Le Dandy which is a stellar fragrance in its own right. I am impressed with what Fremont did with this smoke note considering the era and probably budget he was working with. It smells very realistic burning tobacco and perhaps charcoal and wood on my skin. Very well done fragrance. Not something I could wear as a signature but on certain occasions when I want smoke this would be the ticket. Excellent craftsmanship by Harry Fremont.

It's just way too muted and flat to my nose, like somebody cut the actual notes 30/70 with a neutral talcum powder or something.  What I get is sweet, very softly aromatic, and powdery smooth. The whole fragrances is extremely mellow. There's a burst of aromatic, tangy spice for bare seconds in the opening, but after that it dries down very papery and neutral. I get the sweet note, but the fruit accord is vague and undynamic. The tobacco, suede, and incense are all also faint, powdery shadows that lack any sort of distinct shape.  It makes me think of a corner office and a stack of paperwork; the comfortable tedium of a cushy desk job.  I'm definitely not entirely anosmic to it, but it seems like some aspects of it just aren't coming through for me."", 'Okay.

I really enjoyed wearing this in the Fall / Winter when I wore sweaters.....for some reason it would last longer when I wore them vs a shirt or a t-shirt. Sad to learn this was discontinued. I have never tried any of the other men's fragrances from this house. I recently re-purchased Vera Wang for Men and it reminds me of Michael Kors for Men a little bit...especially the Tobacco note.

This is an EDT but truly behaves like an EDP, outperforming most mainstream selections today. This represents a time when the MK brand was very classy and was all about luxury. Michael is a lost treasure. This is a mildly sweet and ashy tobacco, complimented by fruity notes. There is also that signature note of suede that Mr. Kors used in his original fragrances. It puts you in the mind of D&G The One for Men, launched 7 years after MK's Michael release. They both feature coriander, cardamom, tobacco and an opening note of citrus.

It adheres very well to my skin and clothes, it is extremely orthodox and seriously does its job of making us smell good. The opening gives the sensation of being bland, equal to any scent, but when it dries the magic arrives. I don't find it too sweet, and I can feel the smell of plum, not when it is ripe, but rather a bit Sour/sweet and I feel it for several hours in my case. The tobacco note is fantastic, one of the best I have felt, it does not have the sweetness of The One D&G, or Pure Havane, because in this case it does not have a honeyed note that gives it that characteristic. I tried to perceive the cinnamon, but in vain, it was impossible to isolate it, despite being such a strong note. Age: 30+ Aroma: pleasant Longevity: supersonic close to skin  Versatility: rather nocturnal and autumn. Bottle: regal, beautiful. Use it with caution because it is very sharp, in fact it can be used as a bladed weapon. Disadvantage: discontinued, difficult to find at a affordable price. The other thing is that it can be confused with the modern version, so read well before getting it.

Intoxicating. And unusual. Opens with a slightly anisic, slightly citric, buttery, spicy, sweetness (albeit a mild, understated honey-like sweetness) and soon becomes rich and resonant as what I presume is tobacco comes to the fore. There\'s a leathery note, patchouli, sandalwood and some other things that my inexpert nose cannot identify, but the effect is very three dimensional. The dry down is sublime - leather-woody-patchy and what is apparently plum and/or dried fruit (although I would never have identified these on my own). I can see why some have compared this to Le Dandy. MfM has a similar effect and suggests urbane gentlemanly sophistication: The fragrance of a man who has tout vu, tout lu, tout bu. Or thinks he has. I could see someone like Oscar Wilde wearing this. Michael for Men is one of a handful of fragrances that sets off ""fireworks"" in my brain: I have to constantly resist the urge to reapply for the sheer delight of savouring both the fragrance itself and the cerebral pyrotechnics created by a fresh application of MfM hitting my olfactory system. Reminds me of the discontinued Versace Man (the one in the purple flacon with tobacco and saffron) - the two smell nothing alike but for me they evoke a similar emotional response. This is a truly beautiful composition, like a symphony of sensory pleasure and a mosaic of wonderful things. Think I\'m in love.', 'This was a marvelous perfume....

It's a special occasion scent. Not something casual imo."", 'This is outstanding. The plum and dried fruit is strong and persistent through the lifecycle. It\'s similar to Le Dandy by D\'Orsay, but stronger performance. But Le Dandy has a stronger and more luxuriously delicious gourmand aspect, like rum-soaked spiced plum cake. Really good stuff. In fact, Michael for Men by Michael Kors and Le Dandy by D\'Orsay would probably make a perfect layering pair. They have similar overall scent profiles, and it should offer the best of both: performance and lux gourmand scent. Maybe spray the Le Dandy on the upper torso or neck closer to the nose to enjoy the shorter-lived rum-soaked spice and plum cake in the opening and into the mid, while the longer-lasting and stronger-projecting Michael would shore up the mid and the far drydown. I also have John Varvatos OG, which is also similar although less so, so I might test a triple layering. I\'ve been wearing a clone of Bond no. 9 Andy Warhol and comparing it to Michael for Men by Michael Kors. It was apparent the two were similar, mainly because of the shared plum note. Andy Warhol is closer to Michael for Men that John Varvatos Dark Rebel, that\'s for sure, and maybe even closer than the Varvatos OG. The main differences in Andy Warhol is that it is a bit less sweet, a bit more ""creamy"" and thick due to the amber note being more prominent, a little more smokey/earthy probably due to woody/oud accords, and the plum in Michael for Men manifests being paired with the dried fruits note in the base, and Michael for Men being a bit more Gourmand. I\'m considering added Andy Warhol to this layering group. Update: I have tried the above suggested triple layering with Le Dandy and John Varvatos and it is fantastic! In fact, I now treat these three frags as one package in wearing. Can\'t recommend it enough. And fyi, even though I\'ve never tried the 2014 reformulated version of this, called Michael Kors for Men, it seems to be the epitome of what ""watered down"" means. Weaker performance, different notes (plum and dried fruits in the base removed). This 2001 Michael by Michael Kors OG seems by the evidence to be CONSIDERABLY better than the 2014 slightly renamed reformulation. Oh, and this is NOT an ""Aromatic Fougere"" fragrance as listed on this page, no matter how you slice it.', ""Hidden gem that is discontinued and now disappearing from retailers. This opens with a boozy plum and spices. Reminds me of a plum simmering in brandy or cognac with some cinnamon and star anise thrown in. Kinda like Plum Japonais and as the opening transitions to mid the plum and boozy start to fade into the background before almost disappearing in the drydown. A slightly sweet pipe tobacco emerges along with some leather. No cloying vanilla, tonka, honey or amber here. This is really wonderful and worth seeking out. I traded mine away but missed it and had to get another. In fact this is the only fragrance I traded away and regretted and wound up repurchasing. I tried a lot of tobacco based scents under the $300 and nothing really comes that close to this. Most have too much sweetness and don't let the tobacco shine.

Very special and original composition, both in how you experience this scent, and, in my opinion, the ingredients and aroma chemicals utilized also. This scent sets itself apart from many other tobacco scents I've tried. While being dark and masculine it has an air of gentlemanliness to it. Sadly discontinued and has been reformulated since. However if you love tobacco scents, or perhaps even tobacco/incense style scents, this version is a must have. Top 10 all time tobacco scents IMO. The down side is the performance and longevity.

I actually have a full 75ml bottle of this for sale if anyone is interested.', 'A fairly recent discovery is Michael for Men and what a gem it is. This is a very atypical tobacco scent, lacking the ubiquitous Tonka Bean base note. The fruity accords are pleasant and there is a tingly sensation, perhaps from the star anise. I can\'t think of another juice in my den with that ingredient. Projection is moderate and sillage is, imo, small. Over-application is a must ;-) Longevity is also mediocre...sadly. Re-application is required for a 12 hour+ experience. Good scent for the office as it will definitely not offend. I call this my ""signature scent"", as it is probably the bottle I reach for more often than any other. It\'s such a pleasing scent (SWMBO approved), that I procured two back-up bottles. Worth the effort searching for.', 'If I were to describe this one I would say that there are two prominent notes: fruit and tobacco. Since I do not like fruity accords, all I can say is that I find the fruit notes discordant, to the point that I am reminded of my preferences. It is a good quality scent, no doubt - regardless of the ""sillage - longevity"" combo, it is well crafted in its complexity and the way notes play in its evolution. However, I assume the blend without the dry fruits and the plum would be much closer to my tastes. Edit: Generously applied I can get really nice whiffs of the blend\'s basenotes after light sweating. This changes the review altogether.', 'I see no one has been on this board for many months! I\'m not sure what fragrance I was originally searching that eventually led me to buy the vintage Michael. I spend way too much time reading these things and then bouncing to the reviews for bottles listed in the ""this fragrance reminds me of"" section. Anyway, speaking of a fragrance this reminds me of.

Interested to hear your opinions on that comparison.', ""It's been awhile since I last used MKM...am I ever glad I did. I have the original version created by Givenchy.

Incense adds to complex elements which is appealing and awakens your nose meter. As I take in my second a large breath, I'm able to pick up the woodsy/anise notes adding a the richness of the entire aroma giving it that unique characteristic. Both longevity and Sillage are well worth seeking out the original version. Overall, I wouldn't be able find another cologne which is as well balanced as this one unless I want to spend a lot of money.

Does anyone have any suggestions for a similar fragrance to replace Michael?"", ""Wow, this is complex and unusual, in a way that bridges aromatics from the 80's on through to the present.  First impressions: Fresh and clean at the top, in a way that reminds me of the likes of 80's mainstays such as Pierre Cardin (the water tower bottle). I'm sure it's not even close, but it does evoke that sort of distant memory for me. As it dries down, what I pick up is redolent of that ethereal peppery incense backdrop so beautifully represented in Penhaligon's Opus 1870 (and similarly so in Azzaro Visit), but fleshed out with a touch of sweet, dried fruit and unsmoked tobacco. Up close, I also pick up evergreen and just the faintest suggestion of that leathery, woodsy goodness of Aramis. There's a lot going on in this bottle, to where I'd say one's impression will be very much influenced by things like temperature and the manner in which one applies it to one's self. Case in point: I applied more heavily the day after my initial opinion, and although I still picked up most of the same notes, it did become a bit of a mess -- so go lightly. This also drives home (for me, anyway) a key difference between a borderline niche Opus 1870 -- that tolerates overspraying well, and a designer frag that can seem like it's trying a bit too hard.  When used properly, Michael comes together as what is unmistakably a gentleman's scent, the smell of a man who has his shit together. But when oversprayed, it unfortunately comes across as a muddled and cooked, early 2000's cheapie. Jeckyll and Hyde. I still can't decide which one this truly is.

Hard to describe, quite complex to my nose. To my nose, it opens green, then shift shortly after on a spicy tobacco and patchouli, with a noticeable sweet plum and dried fruit support. It will stay like that until the drydown, except for the entrance of a strong honey-like animalic note (but not sweet), that will have MFM promoted from good to great. Overall performance is above average: projection is strong in the opening, and will become moderate after 60-90min. I was a little underwhelmed by the opening, but this fragrance takes its meaning during the drydown imo. It's not really a refined scent proper for dates/formal events, as it definitely stays in the designer area. Still, very full bottle worthy, even if I wouldn't spend more than $70/80 for a large vintage bottle, since there is more interesting stuff over that price. Best if worn during Fall evenings, 30+ Note: this review is based on a batch of 2013 (thus original formulation).

I\'m surprised it doesn\'t have a higher score. Michael starts off wonderfully spicy, with a lot of warmth and a piquant, snappy bite. I can pick up on some cinnamon and caraway lending heat, and star anise with a sweet, cool kick at the top. There\'s also an almost-animalic like quality in the mix, giving the fragrance something of a daring edge, abeit in a pleasant, wearable sort of way. It\'s a great start to ""Michael"" which only gets better as it develops. Soon in, the tobacco and suede become apparent, establishing the composition\'s heart. The tobacco is fresh and slightly sweet, a true pipe tobacco, and it\'s blended seamlessly with a smooth, velvety suede, subtle, but present and providing a soft, plush texture to the mid. While the spices remain on top, they\'ve receded somewhat, no longer as prominent or pronounced as they were in the first 45 minutes. Curiously, Michael\'s fruity notes are in the base, rather than the top, and gradually a vivid, substantial blend of plum and dried fruits (apricot, prune, dates, etc.) enters the picture until it becomes the dominant accord in the fragrance. The plum brings a sweeter, rounded, boozy and personable, alluring dimension to the whole, and now Michael is at its zenith, with everything working together in harmony, giving off an incredibly enjoyable smell well-suited for fall and winter scenarios. There are the warm, piquant spices from the opening dancing around in the background, the pipe tobacco providing a fresh, aromatic heart, the smooth hint of suede, and dark fruits enveloping everything in their soft, purplish glow. It really is a great fragrance--expertly pieced together and with all of its key accords and notes vivid and discernible.  Michael would make an excellent signature scent. It would also work well for daily wear during the fall and winter, and even as a date fragrance. It has an elegant, yet casual and easy feel, which really makes it a joy to wear--you\'ll feel sharp and composed but not overdressed or self-conscious. Performance is solid, with good longevity, and projection that\'s completely appropriate for this kind of scent--substantial and present without ever shouting. If you are currently looking for a spicy/fruity fragrance with tobacco and suede, this is one of the best options available. Final rating: 9/10 A Side Note: ""Michael"" as it was originally called, was released in 2001. I\'m not sure when exactly, but it was eventually discontinued. Original bottles of Michael said just that--Michael--on the box and bottle. But somewhere along the way, before it was discontinued, they began calling it ""Michael Kors."" As a result, ""Michael Kors"" was printed on the new boxes and bottles of what was once ""Michael."" The problem here is that this change can make it difficult to source a bottle of this discontinued juice. That\'s because an entirely new fragrance was created and released in 2013, this time called ""Michael Kors for Men."" It\'s not the same fragrance, though they may smell slightly similar, there\'s really a big difference between them, and it\'s the old juice that\'s much better. So how can you tell the difference between the bottles of ""Michael Kors"" that were originally ""Michael,"" and produced in 2001, from the bottles of the completely new fragrance produced in 2013 called, ""Michael Kors?"" Here\'s the key: 1) The bottles are different: The discontinued version has ""Michael Kors"" printed on the front of the bottle in pretty small, horizontal letters. The new version says ""Michael Kors"" in much larger, vertical letters running along the side of the bottle. The discontinued version\'s cap is black with gray and white swirls running through it. I\'m pretty sure that the new fragrance\'s cap is pure black. 2) Furthermore, the old boxes are a chrome-like silver, while the 2013 Michael Kors comes in a box that is more of a charcoal-gray, dark silver. The old version\'s box is constructed so that the fragrance is pulled out of its side, from a smaller, black box that fits into the silver box. The 2013 opens like a regular box, from the top. There is no smaller box that fits into it that you can pull out. 3) The other information I\'ve provided is useful if you can\'t get the batch code off the box. But if you can, just check the batch code to make sure the bottle was produced before 2013. As I said earlier, I\'m not exactly sure when it was discontinued, so I don\'t know what dates they run up to. But as long as it\'s before 2013, you can be assured you\'re not getting the new ""Michael Kors for Men."" The website checkfresh.com provides batch code information for most fragrance brands.', 'I have a fifth of my bottle left. why did you take this away from us, Michael? WHY??', 'I love it. It has a similar feel to versace dreamer in that it is a tobacco scent for the winter that also happens to be fresh and energetic. Ideal for people who want to keep active during the cold months. Very good for the office it is undoubtedly a winter fragrance but smells clean and professional also.', 'The opening is gorgeous, with that blend of dried fruits -- figs, dates, that sort of thing -- and plum, anise, sweet tobacco, and incense. The bouquet of sweetness puts me in mind of Paco Rabanne 1 Million (or Remy Cigar) a little bit, and even more so I find it similar to Burberry London in the way it mixes fruit with tobacco and leather/suede.  In fact, I alternate between wearing London and this scent during the holidays because they both capture that essence so well in different ways.', ""Best Fall Fragrance 2016 / 2017 by youtube reviewer Gent Scents Michael for Men is an extremely good fragrance from a top designer. I didn't expect the richness, but this is made by Michael Kors, as a division of Givenchy thereby attesting to the quality of the notes. Definitely a spicy gourmand that packs a punch - and I mean that in a good way. If you want to be noticed - then this is a fragrance that stands out, in a good way. Some people have said it is a throwback to the 80's powerhouse boozy scents with its tobacco, vanilla, and leather.  The boozy vibe is produced by the link of dark plum, anise, spices and tobacco. I don't believe a touch of rum is even included in the mix as the real source of booziness but you could fool me. The deeply masculine and traditional tone is determined by the chord of bergamot, dry woods, patchouli, tobacco and may be a touch of ambergris. The final outcome is simply comforting (in a boozy, smokey and leathery way), warm and conservative with undertones of honeyed tobacco and spices. It is a cozy and comfortable scent meant for intimacy. This is a skin scent, although it projects well from clothing (so a mix would be advised to get more longevity and sillage). Michael for Men has been around for more than a decade and I can see a distinct comparisons in the dried fruit to many John Varvatos fragrances. Great quality, excellent composition, exquisitely chic and lasts 6+ hours on my skin. After that, you can either reapply or move on. After all, you are left with a very sweet and expressive dry-down that is a nice memory - no reason to feel cheated. Michael Kors has created a masterpiece and still stands out after more than a decade. Very Good! Scent - 4.5+/5 stars; Longevity and Sillage - 3.5/5 stars; Overall - 4.5/5 stars for sheer enjoyment!

I loved it so much i was using the M picture with the naked bodies for some of my social profiles.  At that time i knew nothing of the ""mischieves"" the fragrance brands were secretly (or more openly) inflicting on us. This Michael has also been changed. My previous bottle had only Michael written on it, and i believe the cap was of better quality. The new one is plasticky, light, and, well, cheap. The fragrance itself seems to be the same (maybe a bit cheapened) but i have the feeling the old one had more depth and was much rounder.  I don\'t get the top notes. I think Michael is not interested in them either.  What we get from the spray is what we remain with until the end - The scent of dried fruits (think dates, medlars, mango, papaya, plums) is ripe and intense, while the tobacco adds a dry and smoky dimension to this overall nice fragrance. It\'s best within its first hour. A bit too loud maybe but certain statements are best said loud. Smells thin and tired during the later stage. ***(**)', ""definitely not to be confused with the newer Michael Kors by Michael Kors. The first time i sprayed this on i didn't like it... smelled like burnt rubber or something. But then it opened up and i absolutely love it now. Reminds me of Thanksgiving and Christmas at my aunt's house. A nice tobacco/potpourri type smell. After buying the newer version (renamed Michael Kors by Michael Kors), i realized this version is much better and so i bought one on ebay. The tobacco note is what makes it.

Compelled, you adorn your most dangerous outfit, faded and torn jeans and a sueded leather jacket, and light the finest cigar you've been saving for that 'special occasion' - whatever the hell that was supposed to be. You look like death - the sexiest version, that is...sexy as death...hell? Who gives a fuck - you're going to kill it. You go out in search of trouble, in search of meaning, connection, a foolish affair - anything to make you feel alive again. You exude smoked seude and tobacco - that of a phoenix that has risen from the ashes of a past life. After hours of sheepish glances and other shenanigans, you wind up at some new nightclub blasting something you didn't know was a thing. This has to be a mistake...you go in anyways. You scan the room - somewhere in the neon strobing you see the trouble you've been seeking. You make your way over and strike up a conversation - it's painful and awkward but it's new, it's revitalizing. She oozes plums and honey - you want a bite. She invites you back to her place, you don't refuse. Her place reeks of patchouli, incense, and sandalwood...she still smells like heaven - your debauchery ensues to an exhilarating end. You fall asleep in each other's arms - this is the closest she comes to finding love in an ephemeral world. Morning disturbs your flight of fancy - you must return to that bittersweet life. You politely exit - the night of passion clings firmly to your skin...the decadent plum, the hippie sandalwood, the honeyed tobacco, the smoked suede, and the nutty musk of carnal desires. You feel different, a little wicked - you wouldn't have it any other way. Day 55 - The blind Listening to: Radiohead - All I Need Disclaimer: I've never done this in my life - I've heard countless stories and seen things that have lent to this review. Again, it's an elaboration on a theme - I hope you enjoy it! Notes: This is for the old version - the new one is similar but it lacks the honeyed plum note that makes this gorgeous! The opening is a bit of a kitchen, minus the sink - a touch of tarragon, anise, a smoked caraway, a pinch of coriander, and a powdery cinnamon. All of this is expertly blended with a rich tobacco note that is paired with a smoky suede note all drenched in a beautiful honeyed plum. Parts of this are dangerous and parts are nearly edible! The base brings touches of sandalwood (connects the honeyed plum and tobacco), a dry patchouli (to accent the suede), and incense (furthers the smoke note in tobacco and suede). As it gets quieter, the scent becomes more of a smoky and musky skin with just a touch of sweet - this fume is divine and is in my top 6 for a reason! It lasts from 8 to 14 hours on my skin and can easily be worn by either sex - try not to let this beauty get to your head!"", ""I feel this could be unisex. Especially the dry down. Perhaps it is meant exclusively for men, but I'm saying its unisex because I enjoy it so much. The dry down is very warm, sweet and comforting. I enjoy this so much!  I agree with other reviews that the intro is nauseating! I felt assaulted by too many giant notes. If the top is ignored, as many reviews suggested, the dry down is perfection.  I also agree that the sillage is beyond enormous! The longevity is amazing. It has the power of an attar, but it's cologne.  I sometimes feminized this with vanilla essential oil once it settled down. I recieved so many compliments.  To be clear, I am an older career woman who smokes. So this works great on me!  I wish it had not been discontinued! It was moderately priced and lasted such a long time. The Incense, Dried Fruit, Plum (and my addition of vanilla) made that sweet rich Tobacco heavenly!"", ""gave this one to my father. He is 83 and now starting to enjoy parfumes :-) I'm so happy for him. Because his eyes are very bad he can't see much. But his nose works quite well. He can smell the incense and tabacco. He loves the fruity drydown. On his skin it is a well blended soft smell. Stays on for hours. Suits colder winter wether very well.  8/10 , nice bottle as well."", ""Just tried it, used one spritz, tried to wash it off and I'm still enveloped. I feel trapped. I can't imagine subjecting people around me to such a strong, lingering blast. Not a horrible scent, but pedestrian and remarkable for only its potency."", ""At first was blasted with sweet fruits/plum. Then moves to tobacco/booze/incense. Then began to be slightly nauseated at the similarity to a sickening chewing tobacco, like getting a big whiff of some frat-dude's Skool tin.  However, after a few minutes dry-down it balances and mellows and becomes very pleasing. Heavy Tobacco, creamy, rich. Still sweet but not sickly.  I dig it.  The heaviest Tobacco I've come across. Any suggestions on another good tobacco? Besides TF-TV."", ""First of all, this is the kind of fragrance that you can't smell, but others can very well :/.....so be careful with the trigger Dark tobacco, spicy with suede. It last a long time (6 to 8 hours) with 2 sprays I can see men in late 30s to 60 working in office wearing this. A man in early 20s can wear this fragrance if he's confident and manly. Great for fall winter: office, formal event, dates  I rate this one 8.5/10"", 'I am a little confused by this and the signature version... How do I get this? How will I be able to identify I am getting this version? Can anyone assist me with this please?', 'Wasn´t this supposed to be strong? 3 sprays at a MK store and scent evaporated after 30 min. WTF??? nice scent tough.', ""I got this when it first came out, and love it. Mind you, this was around the time nothing but freaking aquatics were around. At the time I felt it was a wonderful throwback to the old school frags of yesteryear. Got a sample for nostalgic purposes, but I must say... it fell short of expectations. For once, it reminded me of a whole lot of other, far superior (in my opinion, of course) fragrances like Givenchy Gentleman, even a whiff of Antaeus. And that's part of why I wasn't awed by Michael... it smell like a million other powerhouses, but without focus. A plain mess. A good effort from Kors, just one that doesn't really wow my world. Maybe then. Not now.  Smell great, my friends. Update: It's an unusual cold day today in S Florida, and this is the time to wear this. I am not crazy with the fruty/plummy element in Kors, but I remember why I was fond of this around Y2K... it was a bold re-interpretation of the fougere, at a time of nothing but Cool Water spinoffs, done by no less than one of the most mainstream designers: Michael Kors. It was and still is a nice effort. Fresh and dirty at the same time (thank the tobacco and leather)... And much better than the current offering at department stores.  Second update: It is a hot and humid summer in S Fla (what else is new?) and I was on the mood for some Kors. Well, funny as it may sounds, upon application, I was immediately reminded of a classic: Azzaro. Yes!!! I know this may sound like heresy for some, but its basically a matter of replacing the anise in Azzaro for a fruity/plummy note and tone down the lavender and ante up the patch. The ONLY downside of wearing this in the heat of summer is that the fruity/plummy note really goes beserk, in your face. I suppose in moderation it may be tolerable. What the hell, I like it loud. Still, I would MUCH recommend original Kors for colder weather."", 'I like this one. Got a sample at the mall. First is sort of dry juicy fruity scent, but that only lasts a couple minutes. then it quickly starts to warm up and turn into a really nice rich and spicy tobacco scent, mixed in with other accenuators giving some freshness, spicyness, dryness, powderyness, but overall it is a rich warm spicy tobacco-y scent. Very nice, rich. Yeah it probably has a lot of patchouli too. I like it.', 'Michael Kors men opens with a blast of plum and fruity notes. Subsequently these turn a little bit soapy and the tobacco starts evolving. Further on the latter gets accentuated by spices and cardamom. Patchouly and sandalwood building up its base. Ipso facto this is not something you might wear with a t-shirt but rather well groomed in a suit. Somehow it is mandatory to appear respectable and elegant while wearing this scent. For the classy gentlemen definitely something to try.', 'First of all this is a givenchy perfume. A very unique one. Smells like a pipe tobacco flavoured with dried fruits Longevity and projection are excellent. Its not for everybody so try before you buy', ""So, this one was a blind buy from my side. Enjoyed it at first, heavy on the tobacco, plum, incense, cinnamon and a slight hint of cardamum. After wearing it a few times, I got a recurring smell of prunes (yes, PRUNES) coming through which started annoying me. Also, I feel it somehow smells dated - not old school, but dated, I can't quite put my finger on it. Anyway, after some months I finally gave in and traded it for another EdT. Sillage and longevity are just fine and I like it, but somehow it's just not me. I advise you to test it once or twice before buying."", 'There are very few scents that I own that just screams Christmas the way that MKM does. Although I must say, MKM isn\'t the typical ""run of the mill"" festive holiday juice as I implied, it\'s a bit more brooding and gothic by composition in my opinion. It has more of a Charles Dickens\' ""A Christmas Carol"" vibe to it. Dark, Boozy and old English. Funny thing is, as synthetic smelling as MKM is, this fragrance still somehow makes you feel so alive when wearing it. A warm blanket of light tobacco and anise wrapped in dark, dried fruits surrounded with enough plum to make Little Jack Horner green with envy. It\'s dark and mysterious while keeping cheerful and upbeat. People are going to like this and want to be around you in a big way.  In retrospect, MKM is what Yatagan should have smelled like. Make sure this unique scent in a very un-unique looking bottle is on your ""try it"" list, then be prepared to have your credit card handy!', ""Michael for Men by MKM is a deep tobacco/spicy frag with a warm vib of honey thou it's not listed. I own vintage Nicole Smith for men, they are both similar with a rich deep aroma of amber and honey making it very luxurious. MK is much more complex with herbal/woodsy notes with a rich aroma after it settles.  What brings this fragrance at very sophisticated level is cardamom, anise star and dried fruit all coming together beautifully with patucchli making it fantastic. Longevity and Silage is excellent lasting well past 8hrs...very consistent with minimal change in aroma.  Final thoughts, The fragrance is perfect during the fall/winter months, with the warmth of your body this opulent frag becomes alive. The fragrance is perfect for a very special occasions. A very charismatic juice...rating is definitely high...9/10"", ""MKM is a powerhouse classic. On me, the notes are tobacco, dried fruit and incense. Longevity is terrific with moderate projection. I wear MKM year round, but I'm careful in the summer, not to over apply.

It is strong as all get out. 3 sprays or someone may get hurt.', 'I like the top notes! Dried fruit and incense, which to me always smells woody, so I interpret this as a fruity-woody scent. Nice!  But Pure Malt it ain\'t. I have a bottle of that. Pure Malt is much more complex and better. The deal-breaker arrives as it dries down about a half hour later - then I get that all too common synthetic note that I associate with the inexpensive scents always found in Ross. It\'s sort of a pungent ""yellow"" note. I suppose it\'s used in perfumery to suggest tobacco. Anyway, I dislike it. It says ""I\'m cheap.""  Projection and longevity is about the usual thing, which is to say disappointing.', 'This is just a beautiful fragrance. I will always keep a bottle of it. Perfect balance between the tobacco and incense and the dried fruit, plum and patchouli. Initially the tobacco and incense comes through but then it sweetens up but not too much that it becomes a summer fragrance.I love the bottle as well. A++ in my books.', ""I find this a little bit tweedy, feels a bit like a men's fragrance was made because it had to be. The women's selection of MK is superb, they are classy. This though just doesn't spark any imagination, boring bottle, boring drydown. The opening though I liked, pretty fresh and spicy, I get the cardamon and cinnamon, lasts pretty well, just a little average for me."", 'Great and sexy smells,for real men only!', 'Just got a sample from Fragrancenet.com and I am surprised. It is very heavy in tobacco, fruits, and incense. However, it is backed up by spices and woods. It smells very masculine and rugged however it is not in your face. Michael Kors for men is pleasant with soft to moderate projection with decent longevity 6-8 hours but it will sit mostly close to the skin. This is perfect for dating, casual, or even dressed up because it smells classy enough. I would say it has a similar vibe to pure malt with regard to the berry note. However, I would say this is closer to pure havane and burberry london the pure malt. This has the spice of burberry london which almost gives it a spiced boozy wine or liquor accord. This is probably from the anise and cinnamon with fruits and incense. Overall it is a very well blended smooth cologne that is undoubtedly masculine. The biggest downfall is projection and longevity. With this many dark and heavy notes listed one would expect it to me beast mode in both regards. It is not! This will sit on your skin and not want to budge after even only a short while. If you are looking for a darker cologne for fall and winter to use in a work or dating situation this might do the trick. You will smell good and masculine without chocking anybody out. I would still recommend pure havane.', 'For me its a nice Tobaco and honey. Nothing of Pure Malt here. Its warm, sexy and masculine. Nice choice for dating.', 'The following review is really for my notes only, its very brief and leaves out a ton of details. Im just typing something that I remember each by. Very syrupy sweet fruity with a good dose of syrupy tobacco.', ""I'm convinced there are two formulations out there of Michael by Michael Kors. One time I tested this at a Perfumania store a handful of years ago and it smelled absolutely divine and I couldn't stop smelling my hand and became accustomed to the smell. Then maybe a year later I bought a bottle at T.J. Maxx and it smelled nothing like the original one I smelled a year prior. It was still nice but smelled nothing like it did before. I'm convinced that Michael Kors for Men has been reformulated for a while now and a shell of its former glory. The new version isn't all that bad but nowhere near as rich, lush, sexy and sophisticated as the original formulation."", ""Pure Malt by Thierry Mugler with spices and tobacco added. It opens up with in your face spices and sweet fruity accord with a touch of tobacco. It then quickly mellows into very nice light fruity tobacco scent with the spices toned down a bit. Moderate projection and good longevity on my skin. A cheap but very underrated masterpiece IMO. It's complex and unique in my book. A throwback scent maybe but my kinda scent it is. The scent gets 4 out of 5 from me. I love it!"", 'Purchased 1 oz blind of this--glad I didn\'t get more. This is actually very nice, for 30 seconds while the top boozy note eclipses the synthetic tobacco scent. I find that many so-called ""tobacco"" colognes do not smell much like tobacco at all. Instead, they have a mixture of compounds that more closely resemble clove oil. This is also true of Cigar by Remy Latour. The rest of the base is a melange of powerful sweet spices (cinnamon, clove, nutmeg), much like a concentrated potpouree. This is blindingly powerful, and IF I wear it I avoid spraying it on my chest, but rather arms and back of head. I don\'t get the dried fruit at all. I had such high hopes for this, and am sadly disappointed. I do not recommend buying this blind unless you are a big fan of faux tobacco scents. (I smoke cigars and a pipe, I know what real tobacco smells like)', ""Another one of the true 'strong' scents. While the smell is reminiscent of fermenting fruit with an liquor vibe, it manages to stay cool and sweet. Fresh, almost. Unlike most sweet scents which turn warm and spicy, this remains cool and most importantly, it freaking lasts. It also maintains it's strength and sillage for an awfully long time. Even 10 hours later it's still sitting stubbornly on the skin, refusing to go away. Yes, it's a little odd. Sometimes sickly. But it's gorgeous, masterful and unique. One of the best and a staple in my wardrobe. 10/10"", 'Beautifully balanced, Michael Kors delivers a potent punch of masculinity beneath a sophisticated velvet glove. It pays homage to the heavily spiced colognes of bygone years and serves as a reminder that there is still a market for such releases, when done with a degree of modernism, sex appeal and sensible pricing. The fragrance opens with subtle boozy aromas (port, mulled wine or perhaps a heavily sherried single malt Whisky) and fruity notes (juicy plums, assorted dried fruits, raisins, etc...). These notes are kept in check by the dry tobacco accords and a gorgeously sharp array of peppery spice. The bottle itself is classic, simple, solid and elegant. Releasing this as his signature scent was a bold move by Michael Kors and one that deserves due praise. A modern treasure amongst designer fragrances. I am hoping to find a replacement bottle this year below the Christmas tree! Thumbs up ;-)', ""Wow, what an excellent blind buy this was! I have just sprayed it on a paper strip 2 minutes ago because I'm about to go to the gym, but I will get back to this. It smells very promising so far, and what is that familiar smell I'm getting?"", ""It's a 50 degree, sunny, fall Saturday. I've been wearing this all day. It projects appropriately and lasts forever on me. Around 8pm I decided to try a bottle of whiskey I hadn't seen before. Bowmore Islay 8 year single malt. Half way through my first glass there's something very familiar. Take the fir out of MK for men and it's dead on. Smokey, slightly sweet, rich like honey obviously boozy. Is this a review for whiskey or cologne? I'll be wearing the frag and sipping the drink quite a bit in the coming days."", 'Used it loved it!! 125ml great bottle very heavy, great value. Let me assure you that when you perceive a cologne off your own skin or clothes, its completely different from when your movement releases the smell molecules towards others.  KEY: Others can smell it long after you nose has stopped picking it up. I envy those who can pick out individual notes and evaluate a cologne objectively from a strip or from skin. Its easy to describe Michael for men as ""stale"" ""urine-like"" etc. because that\'s what\'s easiest to pick up at close quarters when the notes are still bundled. But when they loosen up after a while you apprecaite that this is a power scent, a modern classic. A collector\'s item.', ""I have always imagined this fragrance as a assorted basket of dry fruits (raisins, apricot, dates) served on a layer of suede mat along with a pack of fine cigars. One thing I have noticed while using this fragrance is to spray more than 2-3 sprays on your wrist to experience its complete character. I do not find this fragrance to be very sweet as incense and patchouli provides a very masculine direction to this fragrance.  This fragrance is mostly suited to a cold climate but I also wear this to office. Longevity is good and sillage is soft to moderate for me. Its a nice fragrance and can easily be one's signature. I'm happy to have this in my rotation."", ""Revisiting this for today after a few weeks and how I love it's smoothness.  Sure I have superior fragrances in similar veins but this is thoroughly satisfying today.  It's sweetness is pulled off with dark mellow undertones.  This one is a keeper for sure!"", 'The best ""mainstream"" autumn fragrance there is. Boozy opening with dark grape (plum) notes, developing refined warm woods, tobacco and subtle spicy incense. Powdery drydown is a slight disappoinment however.

I was new to the game and thought that MK smelled disgusting. A few days ago, I decided to revisit a couple of vintage scents and dug up this guy.

But I am very happy to find out MK suits me all the way. I won't feel 'overdressed' by it. It reminds a close relative to Hermes Rocabar, in fact I think of wear one or two spray of each for a more complex and unique performance, not that any one of them isn't unique enough, just because I think more fir resin would addmore nocturnal/wintery vibe. It is avery well balanced frag in which no note seems to stand out from the others but go along hand in hand forming an ultra masculine scent. This is not a shareable scent not even with the most avant garde women. Perfect for a man."", 'Sweet white tobacco, hints of booze, dried fruits reminiscent of apples and apricots, hints of plum, cinnamon, star anise and blonde leather start things off. Sweetness fades a bit going into the mid notes and dry down where warm spices like cardamom, cinnamon and anise plus some patch begin to dominate. Tobacco darkens a bit, suede and sandalwood notes remain in check. Fit for a well dressed gentleman in a business environment and more appropriate for cooler weather. Projection and sillage are quite good, longevity is average. Score 6.5/10', ""I tried john varvatos artisan black and had this nagging sense that it smells similar to 1 scent I had. Lo and behold, it's michael kors for men that I was actually trying to recall!  Matbe the similarity lies in the dried fruit smell. But MK smells stronger, with its tobacco and incense always in the background, and occasional whiffs of anise and sandalwood. On my skin it lasts 5 - 6 hours. Definitely not your usual scent. My score: 4.25 out of 5."", '42gr, it\'s John Varvatos Vintage you\'re referring to. I put it above, you are right. I mentioned Michael Kors in my review of Varatos Vintage, in fact. JVV is a much higher qulaity, nicer, fragrance. Although these two are very similar in scent JVV is smoother, more natural smelling, much classier, and more sophisticated (too much so for me, actually). Personally, I like MK better at 34, yet although I adore neither, it\'s apparent that JVV is the far superior fragrance. It\'s just WAY TOO SERIOUS for someone like me. Maybe when I\'m 60 and ""the most interesting man in the world"" on don it. I picture the Dos Equis guy from the TV commercials wearing John Varatos Vintage as his signature scent. ;-) Classy stuff! Michael Kors, not so much. The cardamon in this Kors is overdone, and as cardamom in any amount, in any fragrance does, eventually makes my skin smell sour, hence the ""urine"" smell that was alluded to in a previous comment. I gave that man a thumbs up, although I still do ""like"" this scent. 7.5/10', ""I don't see honey listed, but I think it has some. It will be perfect for the time when fruitcake is ready to be served (or just some cognac). Michael has some surprises that stay close to skin that make it good for dating, it's something bitter and earthy. It has some lovely transitions too. I wonder if it will work on a rainy summer night. *** No veo miel listada, pero creo que tiene un poco. Será perfecta para las fiestas de invierno y el pastel de frutas (o un poco de cognac). Michael guarda algunas sorpresas cerca de la piel, que lo hacen muy bueno para una cita, algo ligeramente amargo, de tierra. Tiene también algunas transiciones encantadoras.

I don't know if it's my nose or my chemistry but this just doesn't settle down pleasantly on me. The initial impression has something A* about it (which I find a little too sweet for my taste). This soon settles down to a slightly powdery balmy suede on me. No smoke, no spice, no incense. The patchouli is distant and the tobacco just doesn't appear for me (maybe I'm used to English tobacco rather than American-style sweet tobacco? Pipe smokers will understand!). There is some dried fruit and plum but this also fritters itself away and I'm left a bit 'sweet/powdery'. Maybe it's just me?! I'll try again, but I actually washed this off after about 6 hours; I don't remember the last time I did that."", 'I bought this cologne on a whim and I am glad I did.

Mature? Sure, but when was maturity frowned upon. It smells like gentleman...age 16-70. There is really no age range here. My only problem is I ignored this fragrace for years. It is a perfect signature scent for anything 70 degrees or cooler. I couldn't see myself wearing this in the heat it is potent. Think Japon Noir, think Frapin 1270, think Pure Malt, think Cooper Square. It is just a gorgeous fragrance. The sillage and projection makes it a perfect date, work, movie, dinner, professional scent. The aroma itself exudes class and sophistication yet the price (especially ebay and other places) makes this a steal. Often times we run to niche fragrances due to the complexity and uniqueness and this is a fragrance that deserves to be mentioned. Really quick here. Inital spray is a spicy sweetness, immediately the fruity notes come to the party then it becomes a bit darker but never does a dark note jump out. What you really have is a spicy, fruity, tobacco laden fragrance that sort of moves between semi-fresh to dark and mature. The longevity is great as I get about 6-8 hours. The projection is around the 4 hour mark then it comes in a bit but stays romantic through the duration. I think it is quite versatile and inoffensive. Again for me it is pure class as many tobacco fragrances tend to be on my skin. Overall I give it high marks. The price pushes this mark up quite a bit. Full bottle worthy from the frist spray an instant love."", 'Smells like off fruit, calms a little once dried and becomes more refined but the damage is done for me.

There are no gimmicks or distractions here, just a very deep, rich, almost ""chocolately"" feeling tobacco accord due to the dark, earthy, patchouli which is used perfectly here, and the intriguing, and classy hints of dried fruit and plum that form the basis of this refined scent. Longevity is quite good. I get about eight hours from it. Projection is also perfect (about arms length) for a scent such as this and helps, in part, to lend Michael Kors for Men it\'s more formal, sophisticated feel.  This isn\'t an ""exciting"" fragrance by any means, and I don\'t recommend this one to most guys under 30, however, this isn\'t the prootypical ""old man\'s"" fragrance either. No, it\'s is a very classy, masculine, sexy, mature, sophisticated, scent. At first few sniffs it seemed a tad boring to me and a somewhat generic, and to be honest, I wasn\'t sure why so many people have been raving about this scent. But while it isn\'t groundbreaking or revolutionary, Michael Kors IS very well-made and will serve you superbly in the office or on other more formal and even intimate ocassions. If you buy MKM and you don\'t appreciate it at first, I strongly reccomend giving it some time (maybe even trying it out directly against some others fragrances you own) and as so often happens, you may come to appreciate it just as much as I do, and that\'s... quite a lot! :) Highly reccomended. Overall: 7/10', ""I'm closing in on 40 and work in office setting and I'd been looking for a tobacco scent to add to my collection. I had rounded up a few: Pure Havane, Dirty English and this one.  I found MK to be a more polished, mature scent and also a better value than DE at a similar price point ($30 for a 4.2 oz tester). It had a smokier, stronger tobacco than PH for a much better price as well.  MK has now become my go to work scent because its not an overpowering tobacco scent. I get average projection on my skin but this leaves a nice sillage trail that gets compliments. The smoky tobacco note is reminiscent of Aventus to my nose which I like as well.  Long story short, I've sold DE and PH because MK is the superior tobacco office scent and better value IMO."", 'One of the ""richest"" scents I have ever smelled in terms of olfactive pyramid and its result on the skin. I must say this comparing with those colognes I see with lots of ingredients in their composition, in which the result is completely linear and simple, to the point of asking myself: “What about those notes A, B, and C that are here, in the pyramid?” In Michael for Men, this is different. It’s about one of those colognes that you can perfectly identify the existent notes and how they work. On my skin, the start is divinely spicy, with a wonderful and soft cinnamon, well blended with the star anise and beautiful notes of coriander and cardamom. The rest (bergamot, tarragon, etc.) I can’t feel with evidence. Its evolution has real notes of creamy tobacco, incense and, the comfortable part of this scent, with the suede. The base is hot and sweet at the same time. I feel sandalwood and plum. The notes of dried fruits are there, but I really don’t know the effect they cause.  The result: a sophisticated, elegant, and masculine scent. It is important to remember that this one was made for a division of Givenchy, what allows me to say with confidence: “now I understand the great quality”. To finish my review, I am going to do something that I am not used to doing, which is point the target of this cologne: I can’t imagine an 18-year-old OR a punk OR a tattooed hunk guy with his CK underwear and his tight t-shirts wearing this cologne and having the proper success. This cologne reminds me of professional environments, formal occasions, and, above all things, men with the posture and attitude of gentlemen.  Median projection with superb lasting. 10 stars!', ""I first tested this last week but was unimpressed possibly because right after spraying it I got caught in the rain. Regardless I found myself wanting to give it a second try so stopped by a store to do a second testing Well made, one of the best designer fragrances. A creamier blend than I am used to with most designer fragrances. This is an extremely masculine scent that sets itself apart from the pack. It is very distinguished and conjures an image of a thick oil painting of dried fruit in a leather box. The initial dried fruit scent eases you into the almost burgundy leather it ends with. I say burgundy leather because this is definitely a classier leather like a book binding not like a raw hide or a motorcycle jacket. Longevity is pretty good so far as I sprayed it about an hour and a half ago and it doesn't seem to have faded too much. Sillage seems moderate. Overall I recommend to anyone looking for a distinguished leather scent. As for leather scents this is more Ernest Hemingway than Steve McQueen."", 'Lo compre en Puerto Rico y es rico, tabaco suave, vainilla, pacholi, canela suave, y al final talco de barberia.

The same 80's men line as boucheron, cristobal, gucci, etc. For me it smells like a tradtional barber shop. I am not purchasing a big bottle, even though it is very afordable. I can see myself just leaving this sample there in the corner and wear it once in a great while. If you want tobacco go for the cheap Cuba scents line up or a niche one like Costamor Tabacca (extremely good tobacco scent)."", ""I've only tested this one day, but after 6 hours I think its great. The 80's powerhouse idea scared me but the list of notes seemed perfect. It starts like a Thierry Mugler fragrance. Its sweet and projects quite a bit from one spray. The smokey incense with the patchouli and fruit are really nice. There seems to be something missing right in the middle to me but I'll have to try it again to figure it out. There's a pleasant green that stays for a while before the end. It gets to the musky, 80's dad, dry down while being subtle (or at least closer to the skin).

That sums up Michael Kors for men to me in just one word. The variety of top notes surprises me. I only, slightly, get a hint of anise before being hurtled immediately into the heart note of the best sweet tobacco aroma in a fragrance I have experienced yet.  Yes, later the plummy/incense/patchouli background stealthily eases its way in, but for the life of this fragrance, its all about the tobacco. Not quite the projection and sillage monster some would have you believe, this fragrance has solid longevity. I adore its ultra-smooth warmth and really do rate this fragrance very, very highly.

My girl told me that I smell like a MAN...so I'm assuming that is a compliment. Not very strong projection close to the skin and silage isn't that great but the longevity was around 6 hours on me then the only way you smell it was by smashing your nose into your own arm just to take a whiff.

Certainly not for everyone, least of all a kid, this is strictly for a man who knows just who he is and where he is going. Five Gold Stars *****"", 'Very good fragrance from a top designer. I didn\'t expect the richness, but this is made (as a division) by Givenchy. I can see where the quality and notes come from. Definitely a spicy composition that borderlines on being a ""near-gourmand scent"" that packs a punch - and I mean that in a positive sense. If you want to be noticed - then this is a fragrance that stands out, in a good way. Some people have said it is a throwback to the 80\'s powerhouse boozy scents with tobacco, patchouli, vanilla, leather, etc. - I can see why. Most people will expect something that smells cheaper than this does...although there are some noticeable synthetic aspects, it is still a fabulous fragrance for the price. It is a very cozy and comfortable scent meant for intimacy. If you are a ""man"", not a boy trying to smell good on a high-school date, wear it. Leave this stuff to the late-20\'s and up crowd and enjoy a nice cigar while this scent is on you. This is a rich skin scent, although it projects well from clothing (so a mix would be advised to get more longevity and sillage). So, it is a closer-in scent as many describe - I also recommend using the great After Shave Splash Lotion or Balm (which is excellent too) with it to increase the potency. This has been around an entire decade and, although I sampled it before, I always went for something else (not sure why). It is less rich than other scents I have - namely, Gucci Pour Homme I (2003) and more sweet than Dirty English, actually a very nice balance between tobacco, patchouli, incense and the boozy plum & dried fruit (excellent harmony).  I see the comparisons with the dried fruit to John Varvatos - but this is more Varvatos Vintage for me. The tobacco is stronger along with the more notable leather. I have all the John Varvatos bottlings (including Artisan and Artisan Black)...love the entire line - and this has some of the better qualities of tobacco, leather, incense, and dried fruits plus patchouli and sandalwood. This is a truly great bottle of juice for a very reasonable price point. Only drawback is that you don\'t get a very long time with it...as most reviews say, about 4-5 hours or so. But, I have to say that sometimes it is better to have a very good scent last for a shorter period of time than a mediocre scent last a long time (which is often the case). That, ironically, is my only issue with John Varvatos - great quality, excellent composition and exquisite chic-ness that lasts about 4 hours as well. After that, you can either reapply or move on to a flanker, which I often do (separates day into night)...or even bring in a new scent with similar aromatics and let it fly. After all, you are left with a very sweet and expressive drydown that is a nice memory - no reason to feel cheated. Michael Kors was the forerunner of where John Varvatos went and it still stands out after a decade. Very Good! Scent - 8.5+/10; Longevity and Sillage - 7.5/10; Overall - 8+/10 for sheer enjoyment! Just like good sex, it doesn\'t last forever, but when it\'s good - it\'s damn good and you think of it often afterward...wanting more. ;-) Absolutely brilliant for winter holiday parties and cozy, cold nights...', 'The 1st time I tried Michael for Men, I thought, ""disgusssting! Who would wear this nasty stuff? Smells like ****!"" Half an hour later, it smelled even worse (if that were possible). Thoroughly displeased, I washed several times to remove all traces of the offending odor. Some weeks later I sampled it again, just to show someone how vile it was. To my surprise, they liked it- a lot. I gingerly sniffed my wrist again, and, what\'s that? That smells great! Note, it HAD dried down over an hour before I smelled it this time. What a difference! Fairly strong sillage, and I can easily detect it the next day. I\'ve grown to really appreciate this scent. I just need to make sure I apply it well before I leave home to let it air out a bit. Anyone else have a similar experience with this one? PS I detect similarities between this and Cartier\'s Pasha; several notes in common from top through mid to base, with more of a dried fruit,tobacco and boozey notes added. The nod goes to Michael over Pasha, though. See my review of Pasha.', ""I went to an independent perfume store and I saw a last 100ml bottle. I asked the saleslady if I can have it test on my skin and she obliged. She sprayed on my wrist pulse and man it smells wonderful. But then I realized that the scent is familiar, it is the same top notes scent I smelled from my Givenchy Very Irresistible for Men but without the dry/dark chocolate note. The saleslady agreed with me since I bought my Very Irresistible from her a week ago. The resemblance remain until its heart but changes slowly by the dry down. Although she's selling it to me at a sale price of $38, I simply let go of it since the fragrance in my skin resembled with Givenchy Very Irrestible for men.  I just found out that Givenchy house made this for designer Michael Kors in 2001, that figures. It is refined, sensual and distinguished. Longevity is 7hours and close to my skin. Sillage in an hour is great. So this is like an older brother of Givenchy Very Irresistible for Men, 2005. Both are fall and winter wearing perfumes. I would have both it if it is a summer fragrance and more unique scent. but who knows, at $38 for 100ml., I might be tempted to buy it , maybe to layer it with Givenchy V.I. and see how it goes."", ""Sweet & Tobacco-ey!

Especially in the beginning, it has a little pronounced citrus note, that gives only some personality.  It has a very pronounced and tanned tobacco, a very good one, which gains strength after a few minutes and even more at the dry down. It is also very sweet, with a note of dried raisin and plum which also gains strength over the scent, but it is not very fruity, with some woods that give a more mature and elegant bias, and other spices that also offer some depth. Great fix and projection.  Unlike PM, Michael for men is transparent, but also more complex. As I enjoy incense note, I feel this note here, but almost nobody notices this one. I get many compliments with it, every time I use it. This isn’t a young scent itself, but it is neither an old school one, if you enjoy Egoiste, the M7, The Dreamer and Pure Malt you probably will enjoy this frag."", ""Michael Kors for Men is probably the most comfortable masculine out there. What I mean is, it has coziness and warmth - it just doesn't work at the gym or clubbing. It's like relaxing by the fire on a cold winter night. It's like your favorite blanket. A warm, rich, honeyed tobacco smell with fruits (sort of a cherry aroma) and a little bit of leather create a fragrance to represent relaxation and comfort. It might work on a cold winter day if you're moving around, but otherwise Michael Kors for Men is a fragrance for relaxing at home or somewhere with family, like Thanksgiving dinner. And really, there's nothing wrong with that. It's warm and inviting and lasts a while. The drydown is spectacular, and makes me think of Christmas or something. Now, one more thing - there's a suede-like note in there that, uncannily, reminds me of the fruited suede of Donna Karan's great DK Men (also called Fuel). DK Men is my favorite leather scent, and I can't help but feel somewhat reminded in Michael Kors for Men. I wouldn't say Michael Kors for Men is a suitable alternative to DK Fuel (nothing is), but it's almost as if the rebellious biker in DK Fuel came home, took off his leather, and relaxed in his robe with a pipe.

Like Burberry London, I had to give this away which was quite unfortunate."", 'Michael for Men is my favorite tobacco dominant fragrance. I love the phase of the fragrance where the tobacco and suede transitions to patchouli, plum/fruits (while always maintaining the dominant tobacco note).

Of all the fragrances I own, Michael for Men makes me feel the ""richest"". ""Rich"" in like ""I\'ve got money-to-burn rich"" (even though I don\'t). It\'s difficult to explain.

However, I do understand the notion that it has a ""synthetic"" quality. Sometimes I feel this way but other times I don\'t. I think it is due to a powerful, ""modern"" musk, which you won\'t find in the ""power"" fragrances of the 1980s. Obviously, the quality of ingredients is not likely to be on the level of vintage Antaeus. In any case, if you like the idea of a dried fruit/tobacco/patchouli/incense fragrance, you should try this one. If that doesn\'t sound good to you, then just avoid it. It settles down nicely, unlike Bogart Pour Homme, which is similar but I find it to be terribly unbalanced and too simple. Once it settles down, projection (""sillage"") may or may not satisfy you. I think this occurs when the strong musk has mostly dissipated. If you can still smell it at that point, longevity should be very good for you. I wore this quite often a couple years ago but now I find myself drawn to fragrances like Black Walnut, because it doesn\'t have the strong musk that sometimes feels too ""synthetic"" to me.', ""This is such a greAt fragrance, it's very strong, lasts ages, it totally dominates the room.

The same is true with this fragrance. When I first saw this and sniffed it I thought nice but I have other stuff like this and walked away. After reading bamacharm\'s review I thought I owed it another smell, and when I tried it on my skin...o la la!! When you first spray this it is heavy, rich and quite manly. It smells like it has a rich rum or cognac note. The spiciness of cardamom, anise, caraway and corriander should be quite intense but it is actually quite smooth, rounded by the herbal tarragon and fir resin. I can\'t detect the bergamot per se but I\'m sure its helping to smooth this heady mix in the opening. On first try these notes are all I smelled and never got to experience the tobacco and incense notes:earthy and exotic,without the smokiness. This scent is (at the risk of sounding sexist)for men only. This is the ""cigar and brandy after dinner in the library"" type of mens scent, not the actual stale smoke filled room, of course but that all-man ultra masculine type of vibe is echoed here very well I might add. The base in this could have gone another way entirely and had aged woods, leather, etc.,but MK does something very interesting and puts black plum and dried fruit in there, heavenly,sweet and unique. The wood is there as sandalwood is wrapped in a nice patchouli note but the fruitiness offsets the spices and the rich incense and tobacco perfectly. Sexy, daring,elegant and rich this scent has a prescence that is strong yet subdued.It speaks softly but it means every word, surrounds you sweetly but is not cloying and despite the slight fruitiness is never sisssified; a rare quality in colognes and men...

I must say this comparing with those colognes I see with lots of ingredients in their composition, in which the result is completely linear and simple, to the point of asking myself: “What about those notes A, B, and C that are here, in the pyramid?” In Michael for Men, this is different. It’s about one of those colognes that you can perfectly identify the existent notes and how they work. On my skin, the start is divinely spicy, with a wonderful and soft cinnamon, well blended with the star anise and beautiful notes of coriander and cardamom. The rest (bergamot, tarragon, etc.) I can’t feel with evidence. Its evolution has real notes of creamy tobacco, incense and, the comfortable part of this scent, with the suede. The base is hot and sweet at the same time. I feel sandalwood and plum. The notes of dried fruits are there, but I really don’t know the effect they cause.  The result: a sophisticated, elegant, and masculine scent. It is important to remember that this one was made for a division of Givenchy, what allows me to say with confidence: “now I understand the great quality”. To finish my review, I am going to do something that I am not used to doing, which is point the target of this cologne: I can’t imagine an 18-year-old OR a punk OR a tattooed hunk guy with his CK underwear and his tight t-shirts wearing this cologne and having the proper success.

Lets hope it gets a revamp sometime', '@Let_it_be  It’s marketing that usually gets the blame when things don’t take off as expected. What a bit of market research, and basic segmentation/targeting might have done for them…who knows.  Any truth in the rumours that it’s making a return?', ""Miracle Homme was made for the US market - back when it was launched 20 years ago, everyone agreed that this was the type of scent that will sell in the US. Unfortunately, it wasn't as successful as they hoped - and now it's extinct. Blamed it on the marketing, Lancome is asssociated with women's cosmetics - it did not jived with the masculinity in the US. The scent was meant to invoke the freshness of the early morning, I guess that's why they used coffee - but the coffee was subliminal, you can't really smell it. The Pimento is what gave it an unique freshness, very different from the usual citrus opening. However, the drydown is dull - just as dull as the afternoon when the freshness of the morning is gone."", 'This is a very nice offering for casual events, office and other activities that require a casual formal outcome. At first sight, Miracle is basically generic yet it does have a distiguised character.  It could be the perfect scent for a casual event that still requires wearing a nice crisp shirt.  It will not blow you away, but still...is better then 99.9 percent of the designer crap that is on the market right now. If You overspray this, It will be very strong. On clothes, It stays for ages. Just 3, 4 sprays will be more than enough. It is the pure and simple definition of woody aromatic...like gucci rush was.', ""Miracle was my high school fragrance and my first designer fragrance. I loved how fresh and distinguished it made me smell among all of my peers who were dousing themselves in Axe body spray. I used to get a lot compliments from girls and guys every time I wore it. In a way, Armani Code reminds me of Miracle. It's a shame that it was discontinued."", 'It’s okay , but nowhere near as 200$ Okay as the prices are today. Do not buy this for that price you can get some real nice niche fragrances for that price. You could buy PDM fragrances or a 1.7oz of this. You decide', ""Mellow, sweet yet balsamic and bitter, comforting and rich, great blend of coffee and floral, which I can only imagine being the rosewood in it, can't discern one note over another, wouldn't call it woodsy nor gourmand, nor spicy, it's elegant and subtle. Makes 100% sense they decided on Mathieu Kassovitz to be its face."", ""Nice pyramid... the fruit of the creativity of Lancome's marekting team, at the time. But let's talk truth: this is a cardamom-ish lavender on amberwood base. Smells like every other mall amber fragrance, even if far to be the worst one I bumped on. Quite disappointing for being a Francis Kurkdjian scent. And poor projection. The only suggestion I would give to someone who dreams to try it is: do not go out of your way to secure a bottle of this one, it's really not wroth it. If really needed, I'd suggest to go for Lancetti Homme (aka Lui) instead, who does practically the same job, and is still available on ebay for decent prices. Just finished a vintage sample I recently found in a drawer. You were there, I never noticed you, and now you're gone... I tried you, I didn't hate you, but I won't miss you either... RIP, Miracle."", ""I agree with the comment saying it has more of an Aromatic Spicy feel rather than Woody. Although it overall smells quite light, I keep thinking it's also quite sour as someone mentioned down there, like some kind of balsamic resin. Trussardi Inside for Men has clearer, more distinct smell from the tobacco leaf and woods, while Miracle in comparison is 'transparent' for lack of a clearer term.. I'm wondering if CH Men Africa smells like Miracle? I just don't get this Miracle.. After wearing it a few times, it just doesn't do anything for me.. Glad I got to test it a few times from an inexpensive decant. The notes sound very enticing, but the resulting smell is just underwhelming to me.. Perhaps it works much better when smelled by the ladies in the audience? I'd rather hunt down another discontinued gem that has a much more distinct pleasant smell: Nina Ricci Memoire d'Homme.."", 'A woody wonder  I enjoy wearing it but….. The performance is not good It’s different and special  Nothing mind blowing but special', ""Miracle Homme is a spicy and woody fragrance. Its smell is not common, especially compared to current fragrances. I have never smell the maple leaves, maybe that gives it that characteristic aroma, in addition to the pimento note, which is perceptible. It has a nice base of woods. When it reaches to its drydown phase it remembers me to Memoire d'Homme of Nina Ricci. Both fragrances are discontinued now. It had a very good longevity with me, more than 12 hrs. I find it suitable for fall season. Is a good fragrance, but You don't must overpay, for it."", ""I wore Miracle Homme back in the 2000's. I never really did understand the hype about it, honestly, that maple note didn't seem to blend well with the other notes. That maple note, although unique, just seemed out of place.

They only had one bottle and it had once been a tester. It didn't have much out of the bottle and it had the cap so I didn't hesitate to snap it up. Happy to finally have this soothing scent!

It is extremely hard to find and has a cult group of devotees. Miracle Homme is a complex, elegant and modern wood accord with a complex fougere background that invigorates the senses.  In 2001 Monsieur Francis offered us a wonderful composition that has quietly inspired many mainstream designer fragrances today that have achieved super status, while their muse has been sadly forgotten.  Lancome always gives us the lasting power power and quality ingredients that we expect from a top French cosmetic house. Miracle Homme does not let us down on longevity or complexity. Opening with the delicate trace of coffee and refined red pepper and drying down to leave us with a complex mix of balanced dry woods.  My association is the warmth of freshly fallen autumn leaves and the freshness of the early sunrise hours. Definitely a modern mans fragrance, but a woman with confidence can make this her own. Miracle Homme is easily a daytime fragrance that is both distinctive and inoffensive, a very hard balance to achieve.  Performance This fragrance sparkles in Spring and Fall temps ranging from 70-80 F. This is the optimal range for complete exploration of the temperature. Colder and you will not get the correct silage and warmer you will get rapid evaporation and the fragrance may be too heady. Higher humidity also enriches the experience of this one. On clothing you can easily get 8-12 hours out of Miracle Homme. Skin will give you 6-8 hours.  Miracle is discontinued now for over five years. The closest inspirations of this fragrance still in production today are Chanel Allure Sport Extreme and Burberry Brit Rhythm. Each take different approaches, but achieve very similar effects.', 'As a big lover of woody notes, especially cedar and guaiac ones – I couldn’t resist and went for a blind swap and so glad I did! Main idea Colin Maillard described very well. It opens by really dry woodiness, a wood that spent some time near warm stove already and it will not take you even 30 seconds to start the fire. I know cedar note might be tricky for some and irritate nostrils, we have pimento for that hot touch as well. But once you know that word combination “dry spicy cedar” is your thing – you will love it. Vetiver with rosewood I smell in the heart, which gives boozy energetic vibration, anticipation of weekend ahead. In your thoughts you already taking friends to your country-side house, where after skiing in the forest you all can relax near fireplace. A coffee is made on the open fire here, where its aroma blended with fresh air of maple and oakmoss. I like the image of a person this fragrance draws – a person who is able on solid friendships and positively calm. It made me smile when I read that the promoter of it was Matthieu Kassowitz, who is definitely not the one, who can be called calm, no disrespect intended, but might be pimento note describes his personality?..:p Overall, great fragrance, yet I still prefer Cabaret pour Homme Gres, - more bright and chic one in similar category.', ""Nothing amazing and don't understand the hype and longing for the scent.  A fellow perfume collector let me have a spray of his miracle and let me be clear I was expecting to be amazed but unfortunately I think it was quite disappointing.

Unless this was a personal favourite in the '00s I don't get why anybody is longing for this perfume or is willing to pay overprice in order to get their hands on this. My wife has got the original miracle and the so magic version that is now discontinued and she is absolutely in love with both of them and to me it is one of the first impressions I have of my female classmates in junior high school wearing perfume. With this on my mind I was setting out to find the men's version of the women's perfume. Unfortunately I was let down. So what do I get out of this fragrance? I get the oakmoss and the mahogany what the rest of the ingredients are weak and unclear to me. I don't get the coffee or the chile. To me if I should describe it I would actually not go for the description here on the site but I would say that it's an earthy ambery aquatic. And I will actually compare it to one of the vintage Pierre Cardin bleu marine. I actually find it to be quite soapy. Overall I think that this fragrance let me down and didn't fulfil my expectations. And this is unforgivable. The fragrance is not bad but I cannot see myself wearing it.

It certainly doesn\'t smell like a ""chemical mess,"" but I don\'t really find it compelling either. I can barely smell something that might be coffee, so to call this rendering ""energetic"" is being disingenuous, in my opinion. Is for people who like the idea of a coffee scent but really don\'t want to smell the coffee in it? Same goes for the wood and vetiver notes. I propose this one is marketed more at women, who want something ""inoffensive"" for their significant others. On that level, it succeeds brilliantly. My 40 ml will go on my swap list, however, as I wear what I consider ""real"" coffee scents instead.

He achieved the interfusion of woody notes which do not jump out of the composition to much, but they are still sensitive and packed into a round composition that is powdery and sensual..very sensual, almost like a romantic woody fragrance...with powdery silleage. It doesn't reach full sweetness because the wood doesn't allow that and keeps it interesting. The fragrance changes from time to time..typical hierarchy composition where under the base notes is recognizable coffe with a wood.

Xcentric is lighter, more versatile and addictive, I wear this one day that turns into a week straight. I love wearing this in the fall, whether it is chilly or an Indian Summer day, this works.

While there are others that are excellent for specific occasions, this Dunhill X-Centric offers up an extremely versatile frag that feels as comfortable in a suit as in jeans and a camp-shirt. The opening is quite unique, actually. A little bit aquatic, but spiked with a warm peppery note. It dries down musky-woody, but not in the same way that every other drugstore frag does. X-Centric maintains is character, It stays more dry than sweet. Stefan has mentioned that X-Centric smells a lot like Bond No.9 Riverside. There are certainly similarities, especially in the drydown. But Riverside has a more citrus opening and is sweeter overall. I purchased a sample of both to compare, and must say I prefer X-Centric. It\'s just a more distinctive scent. The bottle is very attractive, with it\'s flip-down cap. But the atomizer itself is not very good. It tends to squirt kind of weakly instead of giving a good dispersion.

If you\'re desperate for rosewood in particular and can\'t stretch to something really expensive, by all means give this a go. But for my money, if a CDG wood is what you\'re after, Sequoia is stronger and just as spicy - maybe even more so - and hangs on for longer.

One word for this fragrance...Knockout! I absolutely love the combination of sweet, dry and hot in this woody fragrance it's a really lovely thing and CDG seem to have these odd incense type vibes down to a tee. I find it to be more masculine due to the pimento and woods but it's one of those that is a bit of a oddball and as a result... very much unisex.

Its main problem must be the spray position, which makes things difficult. An average fragrance with moderate to weak staying power and sillage that doesn\'t really offer a new experience.', 'Jeca summed this up perfectly when she described it as like ""African wind"".  Like Africa it conjures up thoughts of dark wood, heat and spices; yet like the wind it\'s sometimes strong and sometimes fleeting. I do really like this one for a change to my usual Summer rotation of aquatics and fresh fruity scents, but I do wish that the overall initial effect of wood, heat and spice lasted a bit longer. P.S. The bottle\'s gorgeous to look at in person, but the shape and position of the nozzle makes it difficult to use!', ""An honest woody/citrus fragrance with some spices thrown in.

Spot on it covers all of those notes. I will echo what many others said. The performance was simply never there. Where others use 4-8 spritzes, I typically use only 1 spritz, but when it comes to Zanzibar, even I had to use half a dozen to get any traction out of this scent at all. Even when I did spray a good number of times, the DIVINE, UNIQUE and DELICIOUS scent was reduced to a mere shadow of itself within 1 hour. This might be a scent to simply keep in a bottle and go to when you need a few moments of something different in your life. I am very sad that this scent is no longer produced because it reminds me of all the best parts of my early 20's. The prices it goes for now are simply not worth it."", ""The descriptions of African wind gave a beautiful mental picture when I smelled this on my skin. They seem pretty fitting. I wouldn't know what wind in Afrika smells like, but it could very well be like this fragrance. It's too bad it stays close to the skin and doesn't last that long. Still, I like this fragrance. And I am happy with my miniature, just to be able to smell it every once in a while."", ""Classy bottle, Lovely smell.

It gets a lot of compliments and is perfect for a date."", ""This perfume is inspired by Ferrari Black and, in my opinion, is very similar. I can feel almost nothing of its olfactory pyramid, but I can identify many things from Ferrari Black's olfactory pyramid, such as the bergamot at the start and the cinnamon and vanilla in the perfume's development, as well as the musk (present in both olfactory pyramids). Although Ferrari Black is a cheap imported perfume compared to others, its performance is poor for the price it charges (around 200 reais), while Vodka Extreme has an extremely similar fragrance and a similar performance to its inspiration, charging a quarter of the price. It's a pleasant, sweet and relatively versatile perfume, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes Ferrari Black or who wants to try a fragrance of this type for cheap.

It\'s so bad that I couldn\'t pass it on even for free.', ""I received it today and it brought back many memories of my first imported perfume as a teenager, Ferrari Black. I can't say how similar it is to Hugo Boss Bottled because I don't remember its fragrance, but the similarity to Ferrari Black is quite obvious. It's a pleasant fragrance to wear, not cloyingly sweet, it's easy to like and it's very versatile, so it can be worn on a wide variety of occasions, in my opinion. For the price paid, it's a bargain, with moderate hold and projection, great for its cost-benefit ratio. I recommend it to anyone who wants to wear a cheap, easy-to-use fragrance and who has fond olfactory memories of Ferrari Black."", ""A very fresh, tasty and light sweet. A little gum. I think it would be a good everyday option. Better than I expected. I think it should be a big hit with the female public...  Because it's so similar to Ferrari Black, it reminds me of something from my childhood, very nostalgic. It makes me want to spray it in the cupboards so that when I open them I can smell it.

One of the best masculine scents in my selection!"", ""This was one of the biggest surprises I've had in recent days, I never wanted to buy it, why? It's super well known as a Ferrari Black countertype. Not that I think FB is bad, but it's very common and it's a very affordable perfume and I always thought it wasn't necessary to buy its countertype. But a friend wanted to make a bargain, and among the perfumes he wanted to let go of was Vodka Extreme, which he bought as a backup because he loves it. So I decided to keep it to see if it was all it was cracked up to be. And it really is! To begin with, it opens completely differently from FB, fresher, less fruity, very piney (pine notes). Here, the pine is not reminiscent of vintage perfumes, because the rosemary together with some slightly sweet notes brings an air of tea, the musk leaves a very comfortable softness and a warm, woody background may even be reminiscent of cinnamon, and that's where the comparisons with FB come in. But I honestly liked this one more, not just because of the scent, but because of the performance, which is superior to FB. It projects well for 2 hours, then leaves traces around you, and even lingers on your skin for up to 10 hours (my experience). Great for fall and winter, it's definitely one for the collection!"", ""Sorry to those who like it, but I can't wear this perfume. It's too strong, intrusive and uncomfortable. Arome reminds me of that flower Lady of the Night. Extremely sweet, cloying. It makes you sick to your stomach. As for the fixation, it's great. You spray it on your chest twice in the morning and at night you can still smell it without even lowering your head. The projection is also great. People all over the world will smell your perfume. It may not have worked for me and some people love it, but I wouldn't recommend buying it in the dark or without trying it.""]"

The scent is very comfortable and delicious, it makes me want to smell it all the time. As people have said, it smells like classic perfumery, a bit like hair gel or aftershave.

Excellent value for money."", ""Vodka Diamond is a Paris Elysees find.  Although the house won't admit it, it's a countertype of my beloved Drakkar Noir. Unlike the perfume that inspired it, the opening is strident, alcoholic and less balanced, perhaps more reminiscent of the old formulations when Drakkar was a bomb.  After a few minutes, the perfume starts to have a clean vibe, with vetiver and lavender (although the olfactory pyramid doesn't show it) and citrus notes reminiscent of deodorant, gel or aftershave (remembering that many were inspired by Drakkar, Cool Water and, in the future, Sauvage kkkk).  But as it dries, this memory disappears and gives way to a comfortable and delicious smell of those purple lavender soaps, with a slight vanilla sweetness, getting very close to its inspiration.  After a while there's a clean, fresh smell. It feels like you've just stepped out of the shower.  Incredibly, the hold is excellent on me and, in the extreme heat, the hotter my body gets, the more the perfume smells like a shower.  When it dries completely, it's different from Drakkar, perhaps because of the slightly different sweetness. And it's funny that when it dries on my clothes it smells like Le Male, perhaps because of the mixture of lavender, sandalwood and vanilla.  In short, it's a signature perfume, for work, very masculine, with a shower vibe, for all climates, with great hold."", ""It's unbelievable that this perfume costs 50 reais. Perfect to wear as a signature, especially if you want to convey a more serious image. I wore it in the torrid heat and it was still pleasant. Incredibly, it was one of the scents I received the most compliments on. It smells like high-quality shaving foam, very fragrant. Excellent value for money."", ""It doesn't remind me of any specific perfume, but it reminds me of the classic men's perfumery of the late 80s and early 90s. Of the entire Vodka line, I think this has the best construction, it's very round, pleasant and aromatic. It has a more classic, old school soap vibe, like Natura Essencial, Drakkar Noir etc. Nice perfume!"", ""In fact, they are similar to Drakkar Noir, only a little more floral due to the jasmine. At the base, a faint vanilla chord appears around the woods. Very pleasant. It's one of the best in the Vodka range in my opinion, if not the best. If you like the classic perfumery vibe, more masculine and rough, it's worth risking a blind. The price is below Kaiak and the chance of regretting it is minimal."", 'I bought this in the dark. It opens super citrusy, you can feel the bergamot and lemon perfectly.  When it reaches the heart notes and the base notes, it has a very mild and refreshing scent, the famous ""shower"" smell, and it stays that way until it disappears from the skin. In other places I\'ve seen people comment that this perfume smells like ""old people"", but in fact some of its notes make it very elegant and it can be worn on hot days or special occasions. This was the PE that lasted the longest on me, about 8 hours. If you spray it on your clothes, it lasts about 3 days and you can still smell the perfume without being close to it.  PE says that this perfume is their own creation, but in my opinion it is inspired by some ""designer"" perfume like all the others, we just haven\'t found out which one yet.

It’s worth mentioning that we have “a good quality short film”. The perfume is classified as EdT. To my surprise it lasts 3-6 hours, addressing to the well-informed vetiver lover’s audience, with a desire to find new interpretations. The actors of this composition are known. The newness comes from the personality of each one. The introduction is short and bright. Citruses are transient characters, with shyness in their expression. The intriguing nutmeg brings warm-spiced wafts, stretching the red carpet for the vetiver. To some extent it resembles Guerlain’s Vetiver, except that the citruses are more present, making the fragrance lively, brighter. What I like about L 'Occitane's vetiver is that they chose a middle way, without being bitter. It doesn’t fall into the smoky and rooted side of Chanel’s Sycomore, but it also doesn’t abound in Guerlain Vetiver's refined brightness. Cedar accentuates the woody vibe, giving the composition maturity and masculinity. Interesting mix!

It was a smoky-sweet wood when newly sprayed, really nice and pleasing, a lot better for me than the strip with the newly-sprayed Eau de Vétyver, which was dry and too woody for me, and which I didn't like so much. A few minutes later, I took out the Vétyver and was surprised at how it had changed. It was now warm and spicy-sweet from the nutmeg, so cozy and familiar, reminiscent of a well-loved sweater. I couldn't stop smelling it; I liked it a lot this time. How did this happen? I thought it was a no-no for me, but now... For a moment I wondered if I got out the wrong tester strip. And then I took out the Baux tester strip, and wow, had this evolved too! It was now smoky wood and incense, a note that I have been loving as of late. It smelled so different from the initial spray, but I love both phases a lot! I don't know if either fragrance had a different mid phase, since I didn't sniff the tester strips again until a little later. Now I want to get one of these for my husband (only one, even though they are both on sale at 45% off, because I also want to get the similarly discounted Verveine Agrumes for myself, hee hee). I'm leaning towards Baux because it is the one that I loved from opening to dry-down, but I'm not sure if he could wear the incense note. He is not a frag lover like myself, only wears what I give him and not always, and I've never given him anything in this vein, so I don't know if he would like it. On the other hand, I didn't like the opening of Vétyver so much, and though I liked the dry-down a lot, I still prefer Baux overall, so I am still leaning towards it. I guess it would be safer to let him take a sniff first before I decide to buy or not to buy (and which... *Baux, Baux, Baux!*)."", 'I always approach boutique or ‘store’ frangrances with caution.

Rather a balanced citrus with woodsy tones already in the initial accord. During early dry down I get the warm and sweet nutmeg while transitioning from citrus to greenish woods and, of course, vetiver. All through the development Eau de Vétyver has a subtle sweet note that certainly isn\'t cloying or heavy but rather a seductive and masculine sweetness. Likewise, the vetiver is a fresh greenish, ""beach-y"" note, not at all pungent or heavy. This is an excellent scent that can be worn all around the year, with the possible exception of scorching hot summer days. I have often worn it at night during summer and it\'s definitely agreeable then. Given the mild, sweet and generally exceptionally ""likable"" accord Eau de Vétyver is perfect for office use and anything from informal/private use to date-safe. Even before signature scent status this garnered a lot of compliments from women of all ages.

The scent is not overwhelming initially, and can be applied multiple times a day if desired, though it lasts a good while on the skin. This fragrance does not weigh down the wearer even if one is sensitive to scents, and especially synthetic ingredients. The scent goes through transformations of perfect harmony from the first splash into final dry down.  The initial expulsion from the bottle has many complex notes in it. It is so well balanced and blended that there is no need to scrutinize each individual note. There is a hint of sweetness, like the sap of a mature vetyver. Definitely masculine. It's not a heavy scent and there are many uplifting elements in there to provide a nice, warm, and enjoyable experience. The dry down is definitely woodsy, manly, and classy in a somewhat classic way. This probably was the first fragrance that I accepted as my signature. I believe it will be timeless and always enjoyed by many generations."", 'Typically, I\'m not a fan of vetiver but this is an exception. I\'m in agreement with previous reviews that say it\'s fresh, clean, earthy and masculine. Although I do smell a slight bit of spice, it\'s certainly not overpowering.  I\'d go so far as to say that it\'s one of the more perfect men\'s fragrances due to its versatility. I\'d feel just as comfortable wearing it to the office, a formal event or hiking. Additionally, it doesn\'t smell ""dated"" and I\'m confident that a man of any age would not only be happy wearing it but would get a fair share of compliments from it as well. There\'s no problem wearing this fragrance year round, although I think it\'s especially nice for the fall and winter months.  If there are any ladies reading this who are trying to come up with a fragrance as a gift for a man in their life, be it son, boyfriend, husband or father - look no further, because this is it. I don\'t see how you can go wrong with this one. Bottom line: Reasonably priced niche fragrance that\'s fresh, clean and earthy.', 'For me, this is the best Vetiver out there, period! Great fragrance, at a great price. 10 of 10.', ""Not a perfumer that I readily think of, but I found this fragrance quite interesting! It's truly a vetiver but with the sharp edges honed down. To my nose it had a floral, soapy body to it pushing the vetiver off to the side, yet still apparent hiding in the background. All in all a refreshing clean scent...would consider purchasing (price was right as well!)....."", ""A blast of vetyver. The kind of EdT to be bought if you want to know how vetyver smells like. Good, as all products of L'Occitane, but monochromatic."", ""I think every single one of us, perfume lovers, have a few fragrances that can't live without. Some boost our self-esteem giving that extra energy to face our days, others are so confortable that relax body and mind even under hard times. Vetyver by L'Occitane are both for me. To me is very natural with quality ingredients. Probably if was written Dior (or whatever) in the bottle, people will praise more this. In my skin this has a really good performance! I get 9-10 hours with 3-4 hours of solid projection. PS: Sorry for my bad english but I think you will understand my feelings"", 'Very good smell, bad performance, attractive price!', ""I buy thus all the time for my partner who is a cautious fragrance wearer. He absolutely lives this one though and it smells so good on him. The smell lingers but the projection is weak, you have to get up close. Warm, woody, masculine (though a woman could wear it - just another dimension to its complexity), musky - like the most gorgeous sweat imaginable. The other l'Occitane offerings for men seem to be more easily available but thus is the best."", ""I'm keen to try more Vetiver scents, this one is very nice, warm and woody, nothing sharp about this vetiver, I don't get the lemon notes at all. I find it gets nicer as it reacts with the skin. The only problem for me is the longevity, it doesn't last very long. Lovely, but i'll stick to Guerlain's Vetiver."", ""The essential adjectives are earthy and raw. Quite frankly, I don't see hype of Guerlain's vetiver. I went into a shop to test Guerlain, really wanting to be wooed. It was quite...flat... Artificial...or rather refined to the point where it lost its soul. L'Occitane surprised me. I entered the store with a prejudice that it was a store just for women and hand creams. I approach the men's colognes and surprised by a vetiver, sample it. It's deep, raw, earthy, wild, druidic. That is what I imagine a vetiver root ripped out of the ground and crushed on a damp French morning in the woods would smell like. Soft, mellow, divine. A pleasant surprise.  Projection is like most quality perfumes these days: poor. As for longevity, it could certainly be better. But I suppose for an application in the evening, before a 'special' night, there is no more enticing a scent."", ""I'm down to half a bottle now, and I will be using it ever so rarely. The L' Occitane site doesn't seem to sell it anymore. This might be a seasonal move. I'll just have to wait. This stuff is outdoor warm weather freshness in a bottle."", ""This is not a bad scent, but compared to Guerlain's Vetiver (1959), it's a disappointment. It just doesn't have that zingy vetiver pungent brightness. In fact, on me it smells more like a vanilla scent or a gourmand than it does anything green.  I am increasingly finding out that Luca Turin is correct: Guerlain's is the reference vetiver."", ""I have only tried the vintage formulation (not the bottle pictured above) and I'd say it's somewhere between Carven Homme and Heritage EdT. After a strong initial salvo, it's a bit weaker than either of those two. However, if you find either of those too sharp or in any way irritating, but like the idea, this is one to try. If I obtain some of the recent formulation I'll report back here with an update. It takes a while for the vetiver to emerge clearly, and while it's quite sweet to begin with, that doesn't last very long. The spice element is quite nice but that doesn't last more than 2-3 hours with strength. A nice effort, as it compare well to other, similar ones (they all seem to have been released around the year 2000, give or take a couple). UPDATE: I tried the newer formulation and it's clearly an attempt to be similar but I suggest getting the older one if you can, because it has better note separation and has good dynamism, which I find to be crucial with this kind of idea."", ""Being a young girl, it is not the most suitable fragrance for myself, but I can't help it. I love the smell of it, and I use not only the fragrance, but also de shower gel. It is completely irresistible."", 'L’occitane Eau de Vetyver is totally the fragrance I go to when I want to smell like a sexy man. Even though I say that this can totally be pulled off by women too. This Vetiver is amazing for its price range and well made. I haven’t tried too many fragrances in this family, but when I smelt this one it struck a chord with me. It took me a while to overcome my bias of vetiver scents being too manly for a woman to pull, but I finally did! I went with my instinct and bought a bottle of it finally and I do not regret it. Honestly, I wish more people wore Vetiver fragrances in general.  Okay so on to the fragrance! Eau de Vetyver starts out bold on the verge of being flamboyant, but it calms down pretty quickly. The vetiver is there from the beginning to the end, potent but never overwhelming. This fragrance in my opinion is great for anyone who has appreciation for woody scents, but also has to have a strong personality to pull it off. I actually do not smell the top notes in this but that’s totally okay with me. The drydown on this is amazing. The vetiver lightens up and starts blending with the nutmeg which is smooth and adds a tiny bit of sweetness to this fragrance on my skin. Also I’m assuming the gauaic is adding some depth to it as well, though I’m not sure what it smells like exactly. Cedar is also present in this but it never takes control and lets vetiver remain the star of the show. Overall Eau de Vetyver is a solid but simple fragrance that can amplify a person’s personality.  I love wearing this! I think women should give this one try if they haven’t already. <3', ""For me this is vetiver done at its best. it's simple, fresh, earthy, and sexy. The projection is not bad... not bad at all. Longevity is about 3 hours. This definitely can be worn in all season and at anytime of the day."", ""I think Eau de Vetyver from L'Occitane is all about vetiver in the most crude, raw aspect in a fragrance I have ever encoutered. And I do like it. I live in a tropical country so I don't know anything about cedar forest or any other sort woodland. But EdV is like being in a sugar cane plantation, without the heat. We have miles and miles of rolling fields of sugar cane in the Northeast of Brazil. And that is the smell you get when travelling through these lands, such organic smell but surrounded by such ... misery. It is a very poor area. Well, if you want to get a glynpse of the smell of a sugar cane plantation, get a bottle of Eau de Vetyver and you will have it. Real life scent can be overpowering, sometimes. It would be Eau de Vetyver EDP. Perhaps there are other scents so natural and close to reality, but for me EdV is the best."", ""This is a great vetiver, not just scent as compared to well known houses, but all-around well done; well priced, liked how it is a balanced vetiver, nutmeg, cedar, bit of a hit of a earthy masculine leather in there. Longevity (one hour), meanssecond thoughts to buy for myself. Some get a couple hours and can remember to re-spray during the day, I don't. Was hoping for the longevity of BAUX and Voyage en Mediterranee (best of line to imo) ."", 'I first got this one in 2005 when it was just eau de parfum so I bought it as such. Later the bottle broke and when I went to get a new one it was suddenly "" pour homme"". Despite this I sometimes wear it, especially in the winter, I love the spicy, warm, soothing fragrance and find the masculinity of it sexy to wear...', 'Clean, spicy vetiver that has a soapy quality. Very versatile and inoffensive. Perfect for office.', ""Based on the positive reviews here, I stopped by the L'Occitane store to give this a quick spritz on my wrist. The opening was wonderful and where the vetiver is most prominent. But after about an hour, the vetiver note was barefly noticeable. The scent that remained seemed to me to be very similar to Tom Ford Black Orchid (which I also enjoy).  I give this high marks as an overall scent, but there are other brands that do vetiver better."", ""The opening on this is lovely ^^ I'm quite sensitive to (artificial) smells and used to avoid perfume counters like the plague :S Thankfully, age has granted me a greater tolerance. Though I still struggle with most Top Notes... L'Occitane is rare in that they enable me to enjoy their offerings from start to finish. As for this specific Vétyver, I love it to bits. Much fresher/lighter than other offerings, like: Guerlain Vetiver (Extreme), Tom Ford Grey Vetiver and Creed Original Vetiver. Also, quite a bit cheaper : ]"", ""I was in the mall and visited the L' Occitane shop to put my nose on some of the men's fragrances. THE EAU DE VETYVER WILL BE MY SUMMER FRAGRANCE! The scent does not compare to anything that I have in my fragrance wardrobe. Much of what I have falls into the same accords and vibe, and I really need to expand my fragrance palate. This one is a good start for me. Update: I bought it and wore it to the gym. I'll be wearing it for the rest of the week as my signature fragrance to work."", ""This is a strange one. I am thrown by the name as to my nose, vetiver plays a smaller role than the other notes. On the opening I get sweet orange with spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice etc. There is also some dry woody notes with just a hint of vetiver. It's really a nice scent, but where most vetivers I own give that soapy and rooty note that is great for warm weather - this one is a warm and spicy scent that seems to fit cool weather better. I need to give it more wearings, but it is a very nice frag and I am happy that I picked up a full bottle. I'm just not sure where this one fits in!"", ""I got this one and Les Eau Des Baux. Eau Des Baux is fantastic and costs a fraction of the price of Tom Ford Tobacco Vanilla. I love Eau D'Vetyver too, though slightly less than Tobacco Vanilla. However, do note that the longevity is not as good as Eau Des Baux. The note rankings indicate that the leather does not stand out, but after an hour, both my wife and I thought that the leather stood out the most."", ""Because I wear Guerlain Homme L'eau Boisee I decided to get the Eau de Vetyver Shower Gel, the scent is very masculine but still has an element of softness. The smell is very similar to the cologne, so I'd recommend getting the Gel if you have the cologne itself. Great!"", ""A fresh and lightly spicy vetiver that is unisex  This was a gift for my husband, but so nice that I've begun wearing it myself.  This opens with a fresh, tart burst of bergamot but within moments all the other ingredients (a goodly amount of nutmeg, a sharp aromatic rosemary, the woody vetiver and fresh cypress) begin to assert themselves. In effect, all the notes are apparent from beginning to end, although the bergamot dissipates rather quickly. Love the addition of the nutmeg, very nice touch here.  Don't expect much development with this fragrance, what you get from the start is consistent throughout, with just a slight softening of the woody vetiver notes toward the end. I don't note any leather in the drydown. Sillage is somewhat weak on both my husband and myself, longevity is about 4-5 hours. Best for daytime, I think. A natural-smelling fragrance that is sure to please those who love subtle scents."", 'i LOVE this fragrance, its a sweet earthy herbal vetyver, reminds me of a few things but still a little different.  Classic smell but modern, wish it lasted longer people can hardy tell ive got it on!', 'More of a spicy chypre than a vetiver scent, Eau de Vétyver tries doing more than it needs to. There\'s a warm blast of nutmeg and some ginger, although I smell more nutmeg here. The typical pencil shaving characteristic haunts the sidelines, alerting me to the presence of cedar, blended with a dry suggestion of vetiver, although honestly I can\'t smell much vetiver at all. L\'Occitane\'s rendition of this famous grass leaves me wishing I\'d spritzed Guerlain\'s Vetiver instead, although I suppose EdV is a little more ""festive,"" and wouldn\'t be out of place at the dinner table on Thanksgiving, with all those warm, nutty peripheral notes distracting from the main course.', ""Can't really smell vetiver in this one. It's a very herbal and fairly linear scent. The nutmeg is pretty strong.  I agree the comparison with Gucci Envy. However the dry-down of EdV is smoother and sweeter than Envy. Perfect for fall and winter. It won't be too cloying in warmer months either."", ""I like it!..... I think its clean, fresh, and light. My wife on the other hand....thinks it smells like old sweat... In fact, it's a disgusting fragrance to her...... Who knew? This is the first fragrance my wife dislikes on me."", 'a little copy of Lalique Incre Noire...', 'a great vetiver fragrance, but still wasted money. Vetiver can´t project that much, but has immense staying power, to me vetiver is aura pure. Too bad that Occitane could make nothing but a faint water dilution of 0% concentration and equally 0% projection. Threw it away, can´t bear it, when someone insults vetiver.', ""I'm a great lover of vetiver-based scents, and this is a very good one. L'Occitane does a great job with earthy 'natural' perfumes, and Eau de Vetyver is a solid example of a love of material. Vetiver is a mysterious substance that can be blended in many ways and clearly the noses at L'Occitane really adore vetiver because they've placed it in a beautiful setting of minimal accompaniments. Even though vetiver is used as the base, it does not have that rough and resinous side that some vetiver perfumes have. This is a simpler and somewhat lighter delivery (than, say, Guerlain's 'Vetiver',) but it still packs a warm and masculine punch. It's sometimes difficult to find men's perfumes that can be distinguished as masculine and yet still retain the lightness that makes it less over-powering. L'Occitane succeeds here on this front. This is a great scent for a man who is just starting out in the world of vetivers, since this is neither sweet nor dirty, but balanced right in the middle."", 'One of my favourites, i get this one for my partner every year as it reminds me of when we first met. Its so lovely, masculine but not energetic and sporty like many manfumes can be. Its spicy and warm, perfect for winters but works in warmer weathers as well. Also, it works for women if you are looking for something different as a change from floral and fruity frags.', 'Well, this is a vetiver that women can easily wear. Again, as with most ""L\'Occitane"" perfumes the longevity is dubious and the nose itching element is there so, try before you buy.  Not bad though!', ""One of my rules is, if after a few wears the frag receives no compliments, it is not doing its job. So...having said that, this one is working. Vetiver, for me, is a nice Summer alternative to the typical male citrus/ fresh colognes that mulitply on the shelves and, this is one of the better ones.  Its subtle sweetness removes the edge off the greeness found in some of the average vetivers (maybe it's the rosemary?).  Sillage is solid and longevity above average. Do not believe it has been discontinued. The Eau de toilette is available at L'Occitane stores and site. And...at $48 a deal!"", ""A nice smooth vetiver fragrance. It is sweet and mild take on vetiver. It also has quite a bit of cypress in it. very well done.  i like it but... it doesn't last very long, i get 3-4 hours and that is about all, my wife did not like this one."", 'I love this one, but if I put too much on, it makes me feel nauseous.

Super longevity !!!! 10/10', ""Starts very masculine, but dries down to a softer scent. The following notes are not listed in the ingredients, but I still get nuances of them: Leather, tobacco and woods. It's very nice without any sweetness or floral edges.

What I've realized is that they are all or a combination of aromatic/floral/vanilla. Dali Homme is very much along the lines of the Versace blue jeans and even Dreamer. It is a thick bombastic perfume of aromatic (lavender) and citrus vanilla (orange dreamsicle). It does have a bit of a synthetic vanilla/Fougere in the dry down. its definitely for the younger crowd, I think it might feel uncomfortable for someone over 35 due to that synthetic note.

If you have tried Minotaure/Nikos Sculpture type scents, this one is in that general range, though this is a bit softer in the drydown.

Upon drydown, the sandalwood, cedar, and sage creates a beautiful, ""cool and yet warm"" serenity to balance the sweetness of the vanilla-like tonka bean (coumarin) paired with the cyclamen-honeyed tobacco. And about an hour after application, I noticed a prominent note not mentioned before: frankincense/olibanum. Though it does indeed have some similarities to \'Laguna\' (pour femme) which I also wear, Laguna Homme is definitely more woody, more coumarin-heavy, the fruitiness is toned down, the florals and citrus are subtle. It is an unusual juxtaposition of notes, for sure- and somehow it works splendidly to transcribe a light breeze and sunlight from a shaded spot on the sand. Performance is pretty excellent because of its solid structure. While I can\'t say I ""love"" Laguna Homme, I really can\'t help but like it!', 'a few words to describe this... 1. simple 2.dated 3.cheap smelling do you want more? it is a pity cause dali does have great fragrances for women....but this is s....t', 'Sold this....very disappointing. A mild vanilla/tonka and very non-descript. Shame', 'Don\'t let the blue bottle fool you...this isn\'t an aquatic. A pleasant and quiet scent...but it\'s missing something. The ""kick"" that other Dali perfumes share isn\'t here. It\'s another fragrance where one note doesn\'t really stand out. You\'d think the vanilla/tonka/coumarin combo would push this into something overly-sweet but it doesn\'t..the wood notes balance it. I would have liked the floral notes to be a little more in the mix. A heavy-handed spray does make this too chemical and acidic.', 'very aromatic and fresh, I dont really see that similarity some speaks about with female,s version, what I get here is a totally masculine scentsuitable for every purpose, the bottle and box are great...love blue sea and silver colors on it', ""I blind bought this.

Calificacion General 7.5/10', ""Laguna has a sweet semi-synthetic opening and an incense/vanilla/tonka drydown.

This is a sort of smoother, warmer bur softer version of Aura with more vanilla though. The drydown, incidentally, is quite like Altamir but much softer. Longevity is only moderate and so is sillage. I was disappointed by this one, I'll use this up for work and I won't buy more. Just sold this in a car boot sale, Laguna is not for me."", ""I do like scent but I care more about human values and personal stance in life. And although I did not read the whole perfume guide but quite a few reviews which are freely available in book selling sites on the internet, as well as the first and the last chapters of the book, the comment the authors make about this scent did attract my attention. My remarks here are not about his comments on the scent but about his comments on Moscow taxidrivers. Having read quite a few reviews as well as the first chapters I can certainly say that this book is not about scent but about scent fashion. I would like to ask the authors what do they know about Moscow taxi drivers which make them think that they are of lesser value than themselves as for certain personality traits. They should know, but what I read suggests to me that they don't, that human beings are not all the same and certainly each person is unique and that is what is great about being a person. I cannot think of anything Moscow taxidrivers in Moscow have in common other than driving a taxi in Moscow. There is a word to refer to the belief that all people of a certain group share certain characteristics that are not stated in the adjective they are refered to by, like for example in the imaginary case that someone believes something about all chinese people other than the fact that they are all chinese, even because whatever I believe they all have in common is never going to be true, and that word is prejudice. The authors might possibly be referring to something as frivolous and inoucuous as the scense of style but I can also certainly say without any doubt that nothing shows so genuine a sense of style as being yourself independently of what other people think you should like or behave like. The whole perspective of the book is from my viewpoint deeply flawed and that starts showing in the introductory chapters. It is said something like Tocade is considered better than addict not for some other reason (which is mentioned but I do not remember the exact wording but is not important for what I am saying), but because it is more beautiful. And while I do like Tocade better than Addict, and do believe that many people like Tocade better than Addict, I would never say that Tocade is more beautiful than addict because I am sure there are people who think the opposite, and beauty, as even the least literate English speaker (even if not their first language, as it is my case, for whom English is a foreign language) certainly heard, is in the eyes of the beholder, meaning by that that it is entirely subjective. More correct would be to say that more people find Tocade more beautiful. I can easily imagine two chidren (adults I find it hard to imagine) arguing about which colour is more beautiful, red or blue, and asking one adult who is right. Or arguing about who owns the most beautiful cap or whatever. That is the stance taken by the authors of the book, with the difference that there is no dialogue there. Well, being one of the authors a renowned scientist (so I am lead to believe) he should know that even scientific statements and theories are only valid in relation to a certain mind frame, tecnological resources and even biological structure of the knower. Truth is an entirely relative matter, according to the certainly predominant view of science and knowledge today. Anyone anyway can realize that scientific statements are changing all the time and being continuously discarded and replaced. Well, if that applies for scientific statements, what is one to think of the subjectivity of the sense of beauty? The only possible framework in which anyone can make any kind of judgement or even any simple analysis of anything, and I am not only referring to beauty, but to anything, is to start by setting out a list of criteria against which the analysis is to be carried out and then conclude about the extent to which whatever object is being judged or analysed does match them. Otherwise, that work is absolutely of no value whatsoever. No one knows better than each person what is better for that person and one of the greatest personal qualities anyone can display is for me, as I am sure it is for lots of other people, not to let other people impose on you what is better for you or what you should find beutiful or enjoy. Then one is really showing sense of style in a way which has certainly a much deeper human value. I do not question the value of the book as a fashion quide, in the most frivoulus way, which anyway is probably what it intends to be and I cannot imagine it to be otherwise. As for the scent, which after all this I do not even feel as commenting on, seems to me to smell of aldehyds and citrus in the opening, and I can also sense a cinnamonish smell, similar to the one I find in Dior Addict, and which I think comes from the tonka bean molecules. The quite intense vanilla scent gets more pronounced as time goes by. I find the scent very recognizable and unique. It is totally different from other orientals, all very much alike, like Jaipur, Le mâle, Hypnôse, Pi, etc. Laguna shares the same oriental spices and vanilla background, but is smells citirc in a to me very very appealing way. Also, it does smell much more complex than any of those scents, fidgety and ethereal, on the top of its deep oriental base.It is one of the masculine scents I like best. The bottle is very pretty and the name is really inspiring, makes me really think of a beautiful natural place."", ""it's like i'm in the sea water, surrounded by white flowers, drinking some beer. Yes i do get that beer stuff and i find it beautiful!"", 'It basically smells lika a really sweet orange. Very similar to the feminine version', ""Got it cheap! Was on my wishlist a while . Vertigo nailed it in her review! I cannot describe it better Complex scent with a big WOW factor as its very bi directional in a way its a warm glowy summer night scent for romantic men but also a bit feminine & strange and powerfull. I think to describe it as not classical but more neo futuristic in a sci-fi scene ( ehhh im losing it?) But i agree people will be put off on its metallic like apeal. Its funny that the cap of this beautiful bottle is blue metallic too :-) I wear it now and worn it on work days and projects well and longevity is superb for 9 hours  If you like the stranger type of scents a bit on the sweet and extravert spicy side will digg this as i am. Im glad i got it. *Update : Gets boring if the smell gets known and almost cloying and thats too bad but thats my taste.

I agree it is not flat, and a bit metallic even (probably because of cedar) and has a decent projection and longevity about 5 hours.  Is it a unisex? Maybe, but not for me. It's just an option for everyday occasions, not a fragrance you would wear for a big event."", ""Hazardous Material. This is a very strong, sharp chemical that I bought twice and gave away twice.

Jump in all but name and in a cooler bottle to boot (forget the usual Dali weirdo nonsense: ""Universe infused with sun...” blah, blah, blah) - and therefore IMHO it has to be recommended as one of the nicest, warmest & most sensual casual male fragrances around.  UPDATE: Shockingly cheap price for a quality fragrance. Wonderfully versatile too with all-year round appeal both for day and night time use. Perhaps a tad sharper than JOOP! Jump but still excellent. Sillage is good for the first three hours and longevity is better, being easily detectable on my skin after 7 hours.', ""Not aquatic AT ALL. Don't be mistaken by it's color and name. Laguna is a very sweet sexy fragrance. The lemon opening quickly turns down to a sweet jasmine/tobaco/vanilla special smell. The sillage is simply awesome. No kiddin, it lasts about 8-10 hours. Great fragrance!"", 'Bought this for my husband, because I like the woman version very much. Thisone smells very good on him!', ""A very longlasting perfume and isn't soft. That should appeal to those who like louder scents. Despite being sweet and having noticeable jasmine and vanilla notes, it's very very masculine, as some have noted. Laguna feels tropical because of the metallic fruity cocktail accord. That, in my perception, evokes beach. And warmth is evoked by its sweetness and the well-dosed flower notes. Like flowers whose smell you usually don't notice, but get noticeable when it's hot. Well, this is my imagery of it. Anyway, it's not a scent to make you fit into hot days by the beach, but rather a hot summer day by the beach translated into a scent. Thus, I personally think it's appropriate to wear Laguna in Fall and Winter. In Summer it can be suffocating. Last, Laguna feels much more expensive than it actually is, and that is, bien sûr, good. And it's a kind of scent that many people do enjoy and wear, so what I don't understand is the fact that I don't notice it being used more often. Isn't that good too, since wearing a non-hit helps making you stand out?"", ""This came to me as a sample, and I didn't like it from the first smell. Strange mixture, and there is something about the sweetness that is disturbing to me.

There is definitely some figginess in here to counter the sharp greens - not the kind of creamy coconut kind of fig, a very green and aromatic fig. There is a beautiful tea note laced throughout lending a sort of floral softness that grows in volume with heat - it can be quite feminine at times! The whole fume is soundly accentuated by a potent cypress note that complements the tea and fig nicely while tying into the soft, slightly creamy white musk in the base. This fume is oddly quiet with one spray in the same area - I had to double up the sprays to really get this fume to shine. The intro was also quieter than the heart - which is the star of the show!

When I first read the notes I thought how different...I must have it! And now that I do I just love it... Although this scent is a fresher one, it is nothing like the usual suspects. It opens with the crisp, dry salaak fruitiness and the woody edge of fig tree bark and after a few minutes a very pure tea note drifted up to my nostrils and actually made me want an iced tea! I just adore the aroma of cypress, and here it is green and wonderful and the olive gives it (as Van Allan said) a moistness that is so very nice. This fragrance is very well done; the drydown is a little lower in volume than the opening or the heart, but still wonderful. The vetiver and tonka create a soft and warm grassiness and the musk is nice and not overly heavy. The teakwood is the note I smell the most. To recap: this begins fresh and fruity, remains wet and green and dries subtle, cool and woody on the skin. Stunning, one of the most treasured scents I have in my entire collection...Trussardi never disappoints me (thus far anyway!)  Sillage: average to good Longevity: quite good Overall: 4.5/5 I love Pythons and this is a pretty good representation of a snake in perfume form.

At middle, it looses a bit the fruity kick but combines with the moisture of olive and the green woodiness of cypress.

My humble rank 7.6/10. ☣☣☣', 'A personal favourite of mine. I love wearing this undemanding and uplifting scent. Despite its blue presentation, this is definitely not an aquatic, and is delightfully light but also has great character. It smells very fruity, clean and berry-like at first but with a very interesting creamy-musky softness underlying it that makes for a lovely drydown. Not a million miles different than Bright Visit, just much smoother and so much better. Great in hot weather too, particularly just after showering. Although it lasts a long time on my skin, it also wears very (actually too) close to it with low sillage. This can usually be overcome with some heavy spraying - which is OK as it is very unlikely to offend anyone - hence a large bottle is a wise purchase. Otherwise, very nice and highly recommended. Can usually be found selling surprisingly cheaply - I don\'t understand how such quality can be sold so cheaply; but anyway I\'m not complaining. P.S. I think the tag ""Python"" appears to be a reference to Trussardi\'s grounding in luxury leathers & skins. A special mention too for the 100 ml bottle: it\'s so awesome-looking!', ""According to Trussardi this fragrance also contains salak pulp. Salak is a Balinese fruit,also called snakefruit, that grows on low palm trees. The fruit can be pinched at the end which causes the skin to slough off-much like a snake's-revealing three lobes that look like garlic cloves and taste apple-like and can be dry/crumbly to crisp/juicy. They also mention that the musk is synthetic and it is the rough bark of the fig tree, and not the fruit,is in this scent which gives it a fig/wood type of smell. The cypress is Mediterranean, the vetiver is from the Bourbon Islands and the teak is Burmese(like a PYTHON)...This is one of my top 5 most wanted scents and I have been desperate to find this, if anyone has any leads let me know..."", 'Python belongs next to CK Truth and Dior Higher. Fresh and ""moist"" fragrance. This is a sophisticated creation and not in the league of Boss and Armani products. Even if Trussardi is not apparently a big popular label I enjoy numerous of their fragrances: Python is for a fresh and well-groomed feeling, Jeans is for casual and easy (to wear), Inside is for elegant but inviting... and L\'uomo which is a discontinued gem :( one of my very favourties! Anyway, I really don\'t get the name Python. I would never associate the name with the natural fresh fragrance and the nice blue color of the bottle and the box. Python suggests something dark, dangerous, animalistic which it is not!', ""I ordered a sample of Python Uomo for my boyfriend, because of the unique combination of the notes. I feel that this scent has a lot of Italian spirit. It's charming-&-carefree and at once elegant-&-well-mannered, full aware of what it's worth.  I can't detect the specific notes, but it smells clean and fresh in the beginning and then becomes very nicely softly soapy. I agree with ZeeK about the sillage (poor), but it lasts long indeed.  I really like it, but we're not going to buy the whole bottle. After all, it has a unique, modern and catchy touch. Good one."", ""i just bought it to my boyfriend, without smelling it first. it's a nice scent, but i think if i had tested it first maybe i wouldn't have bought it. cypres is what you get the most from this fragrance. it's quite long lasting, and i would say that it has something particular about it. it's ok but not the best..."", 'Strange smell and packaging. Gave me a headache. I do not even like to think that one day I ever bought. A low quality product.', 'I approached for Trussardi Python when I found out that it’s remarkably a unique composition that I have never experienced in any other fragrance altogether! What I get is a creamy bunch of various uncommonly used components include: Fig tree bark, Bourbon, Coumarin (that probably an organic compound used as a fragrant-equivalent of Vanilla), Salak Pulp (which is also known as snake fruit due to the reddish-brown scaly skin, may be the title “python” is in that reference). As for conclusion Trussardi Python is a subtle fragrance that stays close to the skin, no doubts for its rarity. My only negative point is for its unfair silage while the fragrance lasts reasonably. This can simply be worn any time and for any occasion.', ""If you like the fresh aromatic scents like Escape and Crave or even Happy, give this one a try. It's got a great fruity burst at the top with a slight tang. This freshness remains quite strong as the cypress come into play too. It's great in summer and lasts well."", 'I think, that Python is not only for men. I had it 2 years ago and it was really charmy/// Like amazone woman////', ""Python takes you to the serenity of a tropical rainforest after the storm. Go ahead, relax and lay down in the grass- no pythons are lurking in the background... Now why would Trussardi discontinue such a de-stressing, calm, well-mannered fragrance? Well it's very simple- it's not abrasive, loud and entitled which means it would not resonate with today's inhabitants of Sauvageville, the capital of Onemillionland.  If you have the privilege of owning this discontinued gem you should cherish it and enjoy the memories it brings."", '*Action: Thank you for the generous decant!!* This scent was everything I hoped for and more! When I first read the notes I thought how different...I must have it! And now that I do I just love it... Although this scent is a fresher one, it is nothing like the usual suspects. It opens with the crisp, dry salaak fruitiness and the woody edge of fig tree bark and after a few minutes a very pure tea note drifted up to my nostrils and actually made me want an iced tea! I just adore the aroma of cypress, and here it is green and wonderful and the olive gives it (as Van Allan said) a moistness that is so very nice. This fragrance is very well done; the drydown is a little lower in volume than the opening or the heart, but still wonderful. The vetiver and tonka create a soft and warm grassiness and the musk is nice and not overly heavy. The teakwood is the note I smell the most. To recap: this begins fresh and fruity, remains wet and green and dries subtle, cool and woody on the skin. Stunning, one of the most treasured scents I have in my entire collection...Trussardi never disappoints me (thus far anyway!)  Sillage: average to good Longevity: quite good Overall: 4.5/5 I love Pythons and this is a pretty good representation of a snake in perfume form. Smooth, cool, sexy with a lush exotic feel from tropical ingredients where Pythons are found. Exotic, but not TOO weird. Classy but not overly heavy or rich...a definite wonder!', ""A breath of fresh Spring air :) Calming fig, sophisticated and well balanced scent... Cypress gives a freshness and a happy feeling through the day. It's original and i haven't find anything similar to this scent. Really gorgeous. A rare olfactory gold"", 'great summer fragrance. i absolutely agree with other reviews, it\'s a bit of everything, a bit aquatic, a bit green, a bit aromatic, a bit blue...but the final blend is not boring or uncreative like other useless releases( Y by ysl for ex..). python at first impression seems nothing special, but after more using it\'s less predictable than it seems to be at first. it has pleasant aquatic notes combined with subtle fig leaf, tea, cypress, musk and vetiver notes. it\'s a gentle smell, relaxing and charmy. the scent is a mix of gucci pour homme 2 + kenzo pour homme but it\'s only my humble opinion. the sea notes in this juice reminds me an holiday in the Isole Tremiti, beautiful little islands in the south of italy, where the sea is transparent and clear, the sun is hot and the atmosphere is relaxing and out of time. the performance is decent, better in longevity than sillage. good for any age and great for summer, for office or casual situations. great fragrance sadly discontinued. grazie per l\'attenzione! scent: 8,5 longevity: 7,5 sillage: 7 versatility:8,5 uniqueness:8 bottle:6,5 compliment factor-7,5 my vote: 8,5 in one word: relaxing ps- i think the name ""python"" doesnt fit for the character of the fragrance, instead of the color of the juice that match perfectly. but it\'s only my opinion.. alternative- bulgari acqua', 'Great summer scent. When I apply it, or better yet when I even take a sniff from a bottle, fruity fig note is the first thing that comes to mind. Sillage is good, not to close to skin, yet not overwhelming and overpowering in any way, just the way summer fragrance should be. Woodsy notes that are in the base of the scent are the ones you should thank for concerning projection and long lasting of this scent. I will buy this again, simply because it is quite unique, and I will always give it an advantage when compared to Bvlgari aquas, Armani acqua di Gio, etc... My recommendation to all of you who like Python - give J. del Pozo Quasar a try!', 'Strange smell and packaging. Gave me a headache. I do not even like to think that one day I ever bought.

This fragrance has much more old-school, retro animalic nastiness than I thought. And a certain mustiness (why is it named ""Must""?) Not that much nastiness, but more so than the vast majority of contemporary fragrances. I thought it was going in the direction of the rough \'n nasty (just a bit) Lagerfeld Classic (1978) and Lauder for Men (mid 1980\'s), but it\'s not that nasty. Its maybe a bit closer, given the cinnamon, to the brilliant Hermes Equipage (1970), but darker and less brilliant. I\'m surprised none of the reviews here point these things out. This is not very close to a Opium Pour Homme or a Boucheron Jaipur nor Costume National Homme (lol!). Nor is it anything like YSL Rive Gauche Pour Homme (lol!) and the only accord it remotely shares with Ralph Lauren Polo Green would be ""earthy"". And it manifests just a little of this description: ""Very smooth cinnamon and orange mixture (creamy)"". Performance seems too moderate for my taste. Sadly, all in all a like at best. And barely that. Update: I was too harsh on this frag. I have since come into possession of Lancome Sagamore (1986) and Must Essence shares a little profile with Sagamore. Must Essence is a bit of a throwback to the mid 1980\'s, with that slight animalic funk. I like Sagamore a lot more that Must Essence.

I don't agree with the rating given to the notes. I picked this fragrance because I thought it would be a super realistic citrus perfume. I expected it to be something like Concentré de Orange Verte's poor cousin. So in this aspect I was a bit disappointed. You can smell citrus notes, but they are not outstanding ones. I can relate Benetton Sport's lightness to that of another mildly citrusy scent-White Musk Sport by the Body Shop. Both are safe and straight-forward fragances that (in my humble opinion) share an Eau de Cologne spirit, without smelling too citrusy or dated. I can't see how these two scents would offend anybody.

I am new to fragrances and blind bought from various designers in the Spring of this year. I am an American male in my 20s.  Myrurgia's Yacht Man Blue was in my first purchase online. I decided to get it to see if these note combinations were something I liked. And I do... However, while the scent is great it just does not and will not last no matter what you do. Iso E Super couldn't save this thing. You truly do get what you pay for(most of the time) in the fragrance world.  It smells like someone spilled a pitcher of cucumber-melon juice on a bouquet of white flowers. The carnation note with the many citrus notes calms the strength of the white floral notes, so that it is a balanced floral fragrance. The scent itself is a 7.25/10. I really do enjoy it. The base notes that stand out to me are the leather and sandalwood, which give it a smooth and creamy foundation. Main accords in this are Fruity(melon/apple), Green, and Floral. Longevity is under 30 minutes for sure. Sillage is about half of an arm's length, or less (for 10 minutes maybe).  The bottle is decent. Sprayer is decent. I couldn't recommend this due to the performance it provides. If anyone does purchase this, I'd consider it as a pre-bedtime fragrance, an experiment if you're new to fragrances, or for cuddling with your loved one. There's literally no way to overspray, so have at it. As far as comparisons, I have yet to encounter something exactly like this. I managed to purchase this fragrance from FragranceNet for $6.66, after a coupon was applied, for the size 3.4 fluid ounces. Hopefully this helps someone."", ""I was also tempted by the Yacht Man Blue offer once and I like the blue ones. The initial citruses are quite pleasant, but after a while, the smell goes into the category of the cheapest air freshener with a hint of white flowers and an overall tragic longevity. So I used the rest (actually almost a complete package) in the toilet. Even at a price of 100 ml below 5$ it doesn't make sense to buy."", 'i wouldnt recommend this to anyone it doesnt last long at all more of an air freshener something to spray in the bathroom thats all the scent is nice but performance and longevity suck', 'For some reason it reminds me of an aquatic drakkar noir, probably the leather notes.

It is quite blended, but I can sort of get a bit of something almond-like and leather-like. The bad news is that anyone who has smelled more than a few decent scents isn\'t likely to think much of this. You need to spray about three times more than usual too. If you are thinking of spending $10 or so on a 100 ml bottle, I think that\'s a waste of money, unless of course you know what you\'re getting and want it. I\'d rather go for some of the Playboy scents, for example, my favorite so far being London. Yacht Man Red and Yacht Man Chocolate, by contrast, are worth a few dollars for sure, IMO. Red is a Dunhill Desire for a Man type scent, and it\'s reasonably strong. Chocolate isn\'t strong but has a drydown I enjoy.

Must've just threw it in the cart because I liked the color. Damn, 23 years already...."", 'lame fougere that has been done a million times. not bad, just nothing new. my opinion has changed, this has grown on me. it is very pleasant after a shower and honestly it’s a great alternative to platinum égoiste or even drakkar noir, just at a lower price. i got a 100 ml bottle for 20 dollars.', ""This is actually like having two fragrances. For the first hour, it is shaving cream, complete with lavender, geranium and, to me, anise, plus a zesty top (I personally get a lime scent) and a touch of woods. Quite straightforward. But just when you think you know what this is, it morphs a bit. The shaving cream remains, but it steps back to allow the cardamom, gardenia, musk, amber and tonka (and extra cedar) to present a smooth, slightly sweet, slightly herbal, accord. This is never sharply herbal in the way that Paco Rabanne PH or Azzaro PH is, and I wouldn't say this is especially green, but there is enough to present an aromatic trio of shaving cream, light herbals and smooth amber/woody base. Wear time is 6 hours for me, with arm's length projection for the first 2 hours. Good for office, casual, possibly formal, and possibly intimate if your significant other is over 35 years old or has fond memories of a father or uncle who would have worn this type of fragrance as a signature fragrance. This is fully masculine yet not at all aggressive. Absolutely blind-buy safe for fougere lovers, a full step up for those who swear by Pinaud Clubman."", 'Idk if it just me, but Argos Adonis Awakens smell 85% similar to this. I sprayed Argos Adonis on my arm and immediately felt like 👍🏾 smelled it before years ago. Considering I had Perry Ellis Elite around 2014, I’m a bit surprised I could draw the comparisons. Of course Argos is higher quality, but the dna is extremely close.', 'Glorious shaving cream! 50% Platinum Egoist and 50% Drakkar Noir!', ""It's a nice fragrance, Fresh, Clean , Green and Airy. It smells so good and very pleasant with reasonable price , A Modern Perfume with Creamy Barbershop Style ! This perfume reminds me a bit of Chanel Platinum Egoiste but Platinum Egoiste has better quality. Overall, l really enjoy it and I like Perry Ellis Portfolio Elite. Longevity is very good. This is perfect for the spring, summer and fall.  Thumbs Up.  Rating : 8 / 10"", 'Definitely similar to Barbasol shaving cream. Actually been looking for a scent that smelled like this. Other ones I have tried had a bite to them but this one is smooth. Fragrance wise its close to Drakkar Noir. Love it for just hanging around the house.', 'Pleasant barbershop fougere and a decent performer. Pretty potent opening that will fill the air. I would wait about twenty minutes before you leave the house or limit yourself to two sprays. Stays on your clothes forever. Definitely for daytime uses like at work or running errands and in the gym. Is one of those that smells nice, clean and inoffensive. If I were still working, and in my office days, I would have worn this a lot. Don’t buy it if you don’t like barbershop frags, it’s definitely “old school”. Not recommended for the the thirty and under crowd. At $14.99 it’s a steal for old guys like me. Scent 7.5 Performance 7.5 Sillage 7.5 Longevity 7.5 Value 8', 'Im a Plainum Egoiste lover for years. So I got Perry . Im extremely diapioted. Smels like wash detergent . Smels very cheep.', 'Wow....  Surprisingly solid for the price ($15/100ml).  In a nutshell. Chanel Platinum Egoiste with a touch more sweetness, especially up top.  My wife digs it too... She likes CPE, Creed GIT, BdC, Percival, etc...  Very solid cheapie, worth the pickup.', ""I laughed at the review that said this smelled like Barbasol until a few minutes after I had this on. It's a pleasant clean scent. Definitely old school smelling. Younger men probably wouldn't like it.  Starts out very strong and earthy like cedar but cedar is not in the note breakdown. Don't let the blue bottle fool you, I'd consider this a green frag. Dries down to to sweeter shaving cream scent that is not bad. After about 5 hours it's all gone but a slight trace.  Wasn't what I was expecting from this one. Will probably sit on my shelf for eternity because I don't even know who to give it too."", ""Good value for the price. It smells to me like a cross between A&F Fierce and Chanel Platinum Egoiste. Rack stores have the large bottle for under $20. Aromatic, Barbershop Fougere Vibe. Clean, versatile & masculine & early 2000's. Brings back good memories."", ""Ok here's the deal. If you want to smell like the inside of a can of Barbasol, buy this. I don't mean that with any negative connotation. I LOVE this stuff. This is a cheapie gem, no doubt. A 100ml can be had for $15 or less. It's got decent performance and no doubt has the barbershop fougere vibe. Get it. You won't regret it. And if by chance you do, it was $15."", 'This is a great smelling fragrance to me. It opens with a barbershop blast and it tricks you into thinking it will be very dry and “mature” from the start. Give it a couple minutes and it starts to open up and becomes more fruity, warm, and sweet. Not too sweet but the apple and floral accords give it almost a juiciness.. not what I was expecting from the initial spray. I own a few Perry Ellis and this is one of my favorites. The longevity is average and the projection is decent. Not beast mode.. but that makes this good for many different occasions. It reminds me of something that could be in the Vince Camuto line (which I love) and like others have said it’s retro and modern. It has fruit elements, but retains its freshness in a soft way. Very very nice. It also reminds me of PE 360 (green bottle) in the dry down. Not as barbershop, and cloying as the green 360. Ages are college and up, day to night, leaning day, I would consider this an all year round juice as it has the freshness of a spring/summer fragrance with the warmth in the mid/dry down. That being said I would not suggest this as a good performer in extreme cold. More of a indoor fall freshie (whatever that is) and a definite work/casual or maybe even semi formal scent. If you like freshies and need one with a bit of a twist.. for the price this is a great option. Overall.. good juice.', 'Retro-modern this starts out with the citrus and fruit but as it dries down you get a sweeter note from the amber/tonka. But, there is that fresh clean French milled soap smell hanging in there. PE is just an under rated brand. Packaging has never been impressive, but the juice is really good. This one would be more fore the mature, but you could use it for most occasions and it would work on all seasons but for summer probably better in the evening.', 'I recently ran out of chrome Azzaro and I was looking for a replacement... This fits that need quite nicely. I was able to get a 3.4 ounce bottle with deodorant from Burlington for only $15. It has that same old school Soapie fresh vibe that I love about Azzaro.. got a compliment on the first day that I wore it which, let’s be honest lads, is a really big reason why we all wear fragrances! If you get a chance pick it up you won’t be disappointed.', 'This is an interesting one. Fresh, juicy, green fougere done the modern way. Somewhere in between Duc de Vervins and Egoiste Platinum with a hint of Azzaro Visit cedar at the dry down. Has also an overall eighties sport shower gel vibe to it which I adore the most. Superb, winning composition, well performing blend. Has a grown up personality and is very versatile, therefore suitable as a signature or sports fragrance.', 'Classy, confident, timeless and masculine. As a woman, I miss men smelling like this. If I were a man, I would rock this with an attitude!', 'It nice... really nice. I waited for quite some time to get my hands on a bottle as it seemed to be difficult to get from a department store. Finally, I saw a bottle of it at a random visit to Ross and I grabbed it up. I see many comments about it being soapy... and a little I get that. But it\'s not overly done, at least not in what you call a detergent sort of way. Sure... it has a resemblance to a clean soapy smell because many of the ingredients in perfumes were used in soaps as well... especially the lavenders, citruses, oak moss and the like. I won\'t go on about how i smell each ingredient and can break it down with my nose... but what I will do is make a comparison to 2 of my favorite classy scents that I am immediately reminded of when i take a whiff. This to me rests somewhere between RL Safari for men and Vera Wang for men. So... am I just going on memory? Nope... I sprayed each (because I have vintage Safari and Vera Wang) and I rest assured my nose was remembering correctly. Safari is a little darker in the greenery and vera wang is a bit lighter and softer. The leather is listed in RLS and VW but not in PEPE, yet there is a combination of things like oakmoss and musk that I would say contribute to a leathery accord. Afterall, leather is/was tanned with oak, oakmoss and other tannin rich foliage... even tea. Common similarities in the green notes... artemisia, mandarin leaf... artemisia... tarragon which is also in the artemisia family. Cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom all have a similar spicy quality and warmth.  Yes the ingredients are not the same... but they each achieved a very similar results which is fantastic. It\'s a ""classy"" type of fragrance that lends to formal or casual just about any season of the year. If I say it is more like one than the other... ok, it is slightly more like Vera Wang than RL Safari. Check it out if you have either of these other fragrances and I think you will definitely see the merit in it.', 'The fougere accord here is obvious but doesn\'t totally dominate. It\'s a bit cool, with herbal/floral and woody elements. It\'s got just a hint of sweetness and it\'s not animalic. From a distance, it\'s reasonably natural smelling as well. In some ways it\'s like a budget version of Gucci\'s Nobile - I think of it as good gift for someone who likes older ""masculine"" scents, but isn\'t any kind of aficionado.', 'Not bad.', 'Portfolio Elite has turned out to be one of my best blind buys. Musky and spicy, but with a hint of sweetness that makes it approachable. The smell is hard to describe, but it smells like a classic cologne with a hint of fruits and spices. Classic yet modern, Portfolio Elite is a cologne I wear on more formal occasions (i.e. weddings, conferences, etc) since it smells very professional. Fills a much needed niche in my fragrance wardrobe.', ""PE will be right on the money for many people's tastes but like other similar 'fougeres' (e.g. FCUK - Friction) the heavy, soapy-florals of this world are just not for me. If it were just a little less heavy on the 'soap' I could see it being a more widely palatable 'fresh sea air' kind of scent.  PE doesn't make me pull a 'stink-face' - LoL - but my first impression turned out to be my lasting impression - the SOAP! FLORAL! robustness is overwhelming and gives me a headache.  I can see why this fragrance has such strong support - it is unusual and changes through the dry-down plus it does project well and lasts a good few hours (on my skin). The darn thing is I get compliments on it too so it's a shame I just can't tolerate it.  Update: The base notes remind me of a cinnamon/incense fragrance I wore not too long ago.....aha..........Breil - Milano - that bit I do like. Update 2: I have come back to this again and am learning to brave the the soapy-floral opening because afterwards you are treated to a very reasonable, ozonic/cinnamon/incense/woods (a fougere I guess). Arguably, an even blend of Breil - Milano and Pal Zileri - Lab iWhite."", ""A lovely fruity, woody & soapy men's fragrance. Staying power and silage are excellent. Yes, it does remind me too, a little, of the gorgeous Platinum Egoiste. Portfolio Elite has its own character though - This is seriously gorgeous juice for me."", 'I remember when I first got this fragrance earlier this year,I was not crazy about the opening. But now I applied it on my skin today, I like the apple accord and the florals. It does remind me of Chanel Platinum Egoiste.', ""In the humidity it can get smelly(in a bad way on my body make up) and dies too quickly in the harsh cold. Also this does not last long, I'm only getting about 3 to 4 hours MAX with this scent, after the first hour it stays very close to the skin. It needs to last 6+ hours if it is considered good by my standards. I wanted to like this, it has a great apple/musky/earthy scent, but the pros don't make up for the cons with me."", 'This was my first PE product in a while, and Ivan honestly say I love it!!! I found on Amazon for $17.99 with free shipping for the 3.4 edt. Wore it today at work and got numerous compliments. Best part is that it lasts all day. A lot of times if you spend $20.00 or less, you get a watered down version that disappears in a minute, but this definitly not the case. Recommended highly.', 'Alcohol heavy opening salvo quickly gives way to an attractive fresh apple minty floral that is very attractive and manages to smell the most natural of any of the Perry Ellis openings. Loc Dong injects a layer of white currant that certainly adds a balance to the more acidic elements of the green apple as Gypsy mentions, but it is also the interaction of the floral middles (lily and geranium) and the noticeable spicy touch of cardamom that creates a very light and sexy atmosphere that allows the apple to float over the top with ease.  Perry Ellis Portfolio Elite is beautifully blended and balanced, an excellent bargain and beyond just being a work fragrance like the original Portfolio, this one is far more versatile and can be used at night. In fact, there are no real limitations to PE Portfolio Elite, it has the makings of an excellent signature scent, though it does suffer from being extremely linear after the opening. Still, the projection and longevity are both exceptional, with 8-10 hours the norm on my skin.  Along with Perry Ellis 360 Red and Perry Ellis Reserve, Perry Ellis Portfolio Elite is one of the showpieces of the Perry Ellis line and can often be spotted at discount prices. One of the best affordable fragrances for men I have come across. Exceptional and certainly good enough to justify it elitist pretensions on the box.', 'Truely an attention getter. When ever I wear it I always get ask and I mean always get ask what do you have on. I need to get another bottle. I can not find in the stores anymore.', 'This is almost identical to Chanel Platinum Egoiste.', 'I do enjoy most of Perry Ellis fragrances but this is too herbal for my taste. This is a strong, woody-herbal fragrance most suited to wearing in Spring. If you like herbal fragrances this is for you. Excellent sillage and longevity.', ""There is nothing like this PE in my wardrobe. So anyway, the opening of this one is strangely strong. I just can't relate it to anything I know. When it begins to quiet down, I can smell white currant with something spicy. I can tell that the scent does get better as I let it develops into something uniquely sweet and sexy, but I just don't like the opening and I just don't have much patience, so this PE doesn't make the cut for me."", 'This takes the original and turns it up a notch and dresses it up and adds an interesting sweetness to it.

How I loved that in him, so much I am not sure whether I was in love with the fragrance, or the fact that wearing it meant that he was expressing in human form what enchanted me about it.  I just loved them both so much that the thought of losing either hurt. So he did gift me one 50ml bottle and I remember bathing in it, when away from him, to remind myself of the kind of man that would wear it, what he was trying to convey, silently, to the world around him.

Reminds of rain in the forest, pungent maritime pine soaring to the sky, the cold of water on the skin. It is silence, the quiet rhythm of life away from clamour and unimportant things.

I think I may like this even better than the Parfum... Too bad Montana does not make these anymore..', ""I wasn't expecting too much from this. Felt it might be overhyped. But I must say, after a slightly brash cheapish initial opening, it very quickly settles down to something rather delightful. I get a lovely mix of ciruses and florals. Soapy as well. It has depth and for the price I'm enjoying it immensely. Not your usual fare at all."", ""With Montana Homme, we may have some confusion, as its bottle is just a few shades lighter than Parfum d'Homme, but what we have here is quite a different direction, and its quite dashing I must say. A radiant citrus opening with a few sprigs of mugwort to bitter it up like an aperitif, but then it gets powdery and feels like Tang if it were made with much more natural citrus flavor. I used to eat Tang powder right out of the jar when I was a kid. It explains a lot. Anyhow, its like the most beautiful Tang powder mixed with nutmeg. And not to fear, my worshippers at the altar of Evernia Prunastri, the oakmoss is here in spades, along with a whole lot of woods, cedar, sandalwood, you decide..."", 'What I’ll say that hasn’t already been said is this: I put three drops on my wrist Tuesday morning, it is now Wednesday night and I can still smell it a bit when I bring my wrist to my nose… the longevity is wild.', 'DrNDJas in his review below nails it pretty good, and the other reviewers have made very valid and observant points as well. I’ll just add that as the fragrance progresses during the wearing it gets more lovely… the powdery “Tang”-like orange note here is part of an interesting & unique opening but is not the dominant note throughout. Recommended 😌', ""DrNDJas is spot-on, so I'm not going to reinvent the wheel here. I'll just underline (like DrNDJas did in the previous comment) that while Montana Parfum d'Homme (red box) is a fantastic masterpiece-level masculine fragrance, here Montana Homme (blue box) is indeed a cheerful and unpretentious Spring/Summer fragrance. Not essential, but very pleasant. Given its price, I have no regrets on my blind buy, that despite being a simple scent, is pretty unique."", ""I own and love Montana Homme Parfum and was intrigued by this lesser-known offering from this house. First thing to know is that although the bottle is identical, Homme has nothing at all to do with Parfum. Whereas the original is aldehydic, leathery, pine, and floral, this one is primarily bitter orange, pepper and cedar. The orange in this case across quite distinctly from most other times I've experienced it in a fragrance: it is dry, almost chalky rather than juicy, similar to the smell of a powered orange drink before adding water. I believe this effect is achieved with the cedar and pepper accord that sits just under the orange/citric notes. I get some bitterness added by artemisia. Do not allow your mind to reflexively wander to comparisons with TDH based on the woody/orange description- it's more cheerful, lighter, and less serious, ideal for cool to warm weather. This is a unique scent that I am glad to add to my collection."", ""I ordered the red boxed Parfum d'Homme and accidentally got sent this with a blue box. I am not upset with that at all! It has become my most reached for fragrance and I get compliments. It is a creamy, slightly sour bitter orange backed by spices and herbs. Performance is good. You will get noticed wearing this since it's quite different and rare. Just bought the red boxed today and while I haven't fully delved into that one I can say that this, the blue one, has more depth to it."", 'Montana Homme is the second(or third if we count the ""Parfum d\'homme light""edition)install in this towering bottle,but there is little resemblance with the past.This frag is a fresh-flowery-powdery one,a bit elegant,a bit sporty,not so unique,but as usual well made by the great Montana house and the performances are great,also a mark of their name!', 'That’s the fourth Montana I purchase and all have been blind buys so far. While the Parfum d’homme (red box) and Carbone left me a good impression, black edition and this one feel more awkward. One thing I must stress for potential buyers: I first tried to get it from an internet site but I received the red box instead. But the picture and the notes listed were definitely for the blue box. So watch out. After a second try I finally received Montana Homme. Though I find it surprisingly not so common, I don’t like it a lot. There’s plenty of orange and lemon for the beginning. But that first blast is very loud and synthetic, and it goes on and on. I patiently wait for the other ingredients to kick in but nothing really happens. I might be able to go through the bottle by layering. I wanted to like it but it feels kind of cheap.', 'YES! Finally! I have been looking all Summer for a clean, linear citrus that i can call my own.  You would think it would be simpler, but alot of the newer ones ive been trying seem desperate to show they have more than just the citrus thing going on. ""I\'m amber too! I\'m green! I\'m woodsy!"" This is not what i am looking for. Montana Homme fits the bill for me, and has the advantage of being less commonly found so i can use it knowing no other guys around are rocking it. While I\'m sure some of you can think of a more accurate interpretation of linear citrus (suggestions welcomed,) the top 3 notes for me out of the gate are white grapefruit, bitter orange, and lemon. The miracle is that while the notes are bright, they are not acrid or sharp in any way. My only complaint is that its longevity is seriously lacking. Multiple sprays and its almost gone in an hour. Seems like they knew that because the sprayer delivers a massive amount with one spray. Ends up working out. --Blue box with bottle shaped cutout center, smoked grey glass with matching plastic cap in \'Tower of Babel\' shape, made in france, parfums Claude Montana, batch code 31111', 'Smells much like Quorum - but a version leaning towards warm/hot weather because of the ramped up lemon. Performance (sillage especially) is very good for several hours. Highly recommended!', ""This review is for Montana Homme in the RED BOX!I love this scent,I love the bitter citrus note mixed with woody scents.This is a masculine scent,I can't imagine a woman would want to wear a frag with such a bitter citrus scent but never say never;this is a for Fall smell to my senses to be worn before and after a good rugby game! I would not blind buy unless its a mini,just to get to know the fragrance.I love the bottle design , also the Montana Homme in the BLUE box is a completely different scent that is sweeter and soapier,but on dry down on MY skin goes pungent and unpleasant as far as I'm concerned!"", 'It is a happiness and well-being potion for men. Smells classic, clean, elegant while complex at the same time. Nothing compares to it. It can be worn for any occasion and at any age : a real magic.', ""Just bought my second bottle today and that too from a small shop i got the first time round!-clean, fresh, lingering scent. Really cheap for the quality..partly because the younger and impressionable generation don't know about this, so let's keep it that way! ;-)"", 'very nice blended classic edt. with a wonderful bergamote-pepper opening than a spicy-iris heart and completly different warm and embracing musk-sandalwood drydown... i can really notice 3 classic phases!!! it can be either a daytime or a nighttime fragrance because it transforms... ok...maybe not groundbreaking milestone... maybe a ""light"" projection but a very decent staying-power!!!', ""Great scent for warm weather. If you already have Cerruti 1881 for men, you will not get much from Montana for men. The differente will be in the opening, when Montana is more citric than Cerruti. In its middle and base notes Montana has 6 notes (out of 10) in common with the middle and base notes of Cerruti. Thus in the drydown both are similar (not identical, because the pine of Cerruti and the amber of Montana holds a difference till the end). Of both I recommend Cerruti because, in my opinion, its complexity, sillage and longevity are superior to Montana's."", ""Superior once again, this is a noble scent. I can't believe when I first received, there is no other scent like it, true as it described the lemony notes but never expected this good. I must say, montana though long gone and I guess teens nowdays are not familiar with the brand as I am back in 90's and reunite the brand once again here in my closet. Montana deserve 10/10"", ""Montana is true classic, chic and prestigious. This is not available in my country now, long time ago it was, the clothing and perfumes found in most stores, now gone. Despite the bottle design which resemble the tower of babel, the content is serious. I'm getting the black edition and homme, I cannot wait. I hope it's just as good as the late parfum d'homme, packaged in red box and green bottle."", 'I find this one very different to the female version, much more green,less barroque,isnt a bad one,but not memorable either, anyway,not a bad one', 'Love this one. A little bit simple and too lemony at first, but this is all about the dry down for me. Dries down to a wonderful, clean, slightly soapy, slightly floral (geranium?) smell. Fresh and beautiful rather than overtly masculine - just enough herbs late on to keep it gently masculine. Definitely a spring/summer fragrance. Subtle but nicely balanced - quietly complex compared to a lot of citrus fragrances. Projects softly after the strong lemon top notes. Longevity is good - 8+ hours on me.  Fresh, subtle and lovely.', 'Marvellous perfume. Funnily enough I got it by mistake. I was sent the wrong perfume. It does not smell masculine at all, it does smell rather feminine. It is in fact a floral perfume. The lemon scent is only in the opening and what remains as that sort of citric perfume is not lemon but geranium, whose smell is very similar to lemon, but without the acidity, in fact it is floral lemon. This perfume is nevertheless sweeter and fresher than geranium on its own, and the herbs are slightly noticeable, but by far the dominant note here, after the lemony opening, is geranium. It is all about this flower. The perfume was even nicer when I was wearing it than smelled directly from my skin. Wearing it sent me sky high. And I do not usually like masculine perfumes. But this one is amazing. Sillage and longevity are also very good.', 'its master piece in world of perfumes', 'Excellent fragrance Very citric and refreshing . It smells refined and It is totally unique when compared to other citrus fragrances . and most importantly it lasts !!!! Lovely lovely fragrance .A definate favourite in my wardrobe', 'CITRIC & SPICY, A BEAUTIFUL COMBINATION. LAST LONG ON MY SKIN. I LIKE IT!', ""That's exactly why I prefer this one. I love the citrus notes and the longevity. I can spritz in the morning, spend the day in the heat outdoors and never smell the slightest bit musky. It's always fresh and clean and yet smells totally unlike the others in the popular citrus category."", ""Too citric for my taste. All I can smell is the top notes. I cannot smell the warmer base notes, even after hours. I prefer the original Montana; it's actually one of my favorites."", 'its master piece in world of perfumes', 'Excellent fragrance Very citric and refreshing .
