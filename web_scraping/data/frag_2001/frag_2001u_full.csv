More like the memory of tobacco. Faint incense in the background, a little powder, like old books. it feels old but not outdated. Like a faded photo, or someone who left long ago but you still think about them. It’s warm, dry, nostalgic. Not for compliments, but for moments when you want to disappear a little.

Subtle, just the right amount of sweet, with a glowing warmth like embers. It draws you in and then rewards you with complexity — it’s seductive without trying hard. One of my favorite things ever is to bury my face in a sweater I just took off and inhale this complex & enveloping drydown…it is unbelievably beautiful.

It has nothing to do with either tobacco or hay, which made the original perfume unique and legendary. I'm not saying this to make a scene (which some reviewers here like to do), it is simply the truth. If you wanna know what Chergui really is, buy a sample of the original on eBay."", ""Western take of a middle eastern fragrance.  Honey, Tobacco and dried Hay and it smells exactly of those 3 things. I understand where the hype would have come from before the western worlds exposure to middle eastern fragrances but I don't feel it is warranted now. It is cleaner (as in higher quality) smelling than my other Middle Eastern fragrances so the price is warranted for the quality but it is redundant if you have many spicy/tobacco fragrances already (the honey note is the only note that sets it apart). It is nice but not special enough in my collection that I may let it go."", 'Chergui, hot sweet wind from the sands.... Yes, it\'s unisex. But - It\'s not pretty woman scent.

And take a ride.', ""This is much more masculine than I anticipated from the description. I myself wear men's fragrances on occasion but something about this just screams hairy chest to me.

At first, the scent is a little fruity, with quite a bit of florals poking through. Chergui dries down to smelling like a mix of my aunt’s old perfume and my grandparents’ cigarette-smelling house. Very comforting and nostalgic scent.', 'Today I\'m going to be taking at look at Serge Lutens\' Chergui. This is another that has been on my list of fragrances to try for quite some time, probably the better part of a year. The note breakdown with honey, tobacco, and hay notes was intriguing to me, and with my natural affinity for tobacco anyway it was something I knew I had to experience for myself. Let\'s get into it and see if it\'s as good as I hope it is. Scent: The opening is sweet, spicy, and warm. The primary notes I get are tobacco leaf, sandalwood, incense, and hay. The strongest of the notes are the tobacco leaf and hay. The tobacco leaf starts off the opening with a cozy, sweet, warmth that is powerful but gentle at the same time. It announces itself clearly as the dominant note, but doesn\'t assault the nose doing so. Following behind the tobacco leaf is the hay note. In this fragrance the hay comes across as dry and grassy with subtle sweet nuances as well. There\'s a green-ness about it, but not so much that I would call it a green note. More so than that, there\'s a certain facet of the note that I can best describe as ""sun-baked"". It\'s warm and almost solar, but not quite; like a bale of hay on a warm spring day. Up next is the sandalwood and incense. The sandalwood confers a sturdy woodiness tinged with a bit of powder and flecked with just a touch of spice on the back end. Lastly, the incense adds a bit more spice along with some smokiness in the background. The dry down is sweet, warm, and balsamic. The primary notes I get are tobacco leaf, honey, amber, and hay. The strongest of the notes are still the tobacco leaf and hay. Not much has changed with the notes from the dry down; the tobacco leaf is still warm and sweet, and the hay is still dry and grassy. The only notable difference is they feel a little fuller and more rounded out. This is followed by the honey and amber. The honey has emerged in the dry down to provide a gourmand, sticky sweetness to the base of the fragrance. It\'s not over the top or strong enough to mask the tobacco leaf or hay, it instead helps to bolster and accentuate the sweet elements of those notes and give them a gourmand edge. Lastly, the amber is nestled securely in the background as a deep, rich, resinous sweetness; similar in tone to the Amber Xtreme notes from Prada\'s Luna Rossa Ocean EDP and Parfum. The dry down reminds me a bit of Tumi\'s Continuum as well. Performance: Initial projection in the first hour is very strong and can fill a room. Sillage matches that intensity with a dense and heavy scent trail. After about four hours the projection was still about 5-6 feet and the scent trail was a bit lighter but still easily noticeable. After about 7-8 hours the projection had died down to about 3 feet, but the scent trail had remained just as noticeable. The fragrance became a skin scent around the 10-11 hour mark. When to wear: Chergui is a fall/winter fragrance best suited for evening wear. This is not a casual wearing fragrance, but will work great for formal occasions, and even better for special occasions like date nights or anniversaries. Because of the powerful sweetness, this is not something I\'d wear to the office. Blind buy: If you like sweet and balsamic fragrances like Luna Rossa Ocean EDP or Continuum, this is a safe blind buy for you. Final verdict: Chergui was a very enjoyable wear. The scent profile is very in line with what I typically enjoy; sweet, warm, spicy with focus on tobacco. The one thing that did surprise me is that it was more ""designer"" than I imagined it would be. Now there\'s nothing necessarily wrong with that, I was just a little underwhelmed is all. In terms of performance Chergui did well. Strong projection and scent trails for about 4 hours, and lasting about 10-11 before fading away. Versatility is technically below average but that\'s to be expected for a fragrance in this category. It\'s made for cooler weather and works great for formal or special occasions, but that\'s about it. When it comes to mass-appeal Chergui scored higher than I thought it would due to it\'s ""designer"" vibes. It focuses on sweetness and warmth which are very safe and popular accords, and doesn\'t go too heavy or get challenging in any way. This is one of those fragrances that most people will think smells great and will get lots of compliments. In conclusion, Chergui is a solid sweet tobacco fragrance and will be an easy wear for most people. If I didn\'t have anything like that in my collection and I was just starting to get into tobacco, Chergui would be a great place to start. But since I already have a strong collection of fragrances in this category and Chergui isn\'t offering anything unique to the DNA, I\'ll have to pass on getting a full bottle for now. Still, I\'d recommend this to anyone to try because it really does smell great. Scent: 9/10 Longevity: 8/10 Sillage: 8/10', 'Just received my bottle, and I get strong Feve Delicieuse vibes from the opening.', 'Chergui is elegance bottled: quiet, assured, and impossibly refined. I reach for it when I want to feel polished, especially on formal evenings or in colder weather when something rich and distinctive feels right. A refined swirl of hay and honey, softly threaded with iris, tobacco, and a whisper of incense, all resting on a plush amber base. There’s a sweetness to it, but it’s the kind that whispers rather than shouts. Despite how plush and layered it is, it somehow manages to wear well in dry heat, almost like catching warm spices in the air on a sun-baked breeze. It’s decadent, but never flashy. I have the older formulation, which feels exceptionally smooth and well-blended. This is not a fragrance I imagine on someone very young unless she’s especially grand. It’s stately and self-assured, and though it’s unisex, the soft warmth and hint of sweetness give it just enough femininity to suit my tastes perfectly.', 'The grass has just been cut, there are piles of it, and I am doing somersaults on them.', ""Seriously the prominent amber here has legs, it sneaks out almost completely around hour two. You need to do a few full wears to adore this art piece. Hate the amber at first sniff, but its quality and characteristic really save it.  The opening has a tangy & powdery scent that instantly reminds me of Xerjoff Richwood's early stage. Then the amber comes in and dominates the scent for the first 2 hours. Up close, it is that sweet (annoying to me) amber that you can smell in almost all dominant amber accord fragrances. However, in the air/whiff, it is like a dusty/powdery floral with a bit of tanginess to it, and less of that ambery sweetness. I cannot smell any tobacco and leather in here. It could be in the very far back to round the scent. When the amber rested after working for 2 hours, I can smell the toned down opening again for a bit, before it slowly turned into a dusty soft fragrance with a very tiny hint of maybe vanilla or immortelle.  Longevity is 6+ hours. Well projection in the first 2 hours. Pleasantly enjoy the whiffs of this."", 'black label: opens with powdery iris, but develops into fruity tobacco and hay. yes in this new version there is no tobacco listed in the notes. but immortelle instead, and i quote: A sweet and dry herbaceous note, reminiscent of hay, tobacco, and honey. so yeah, theres that. the leather listed in the black version is very mild and suede like. sadly, weak projection.', ""This is a Great Oriental Spicy Fragrance ! Unique, Warm , Sweet and Complex. Chergui was on my Radar about two years and I bought Ambre Sultan blind-buy last year. I bought chergui blind-buy after reading positive comments and reviews, I watched reviews on YouTube too. Chergui sold out everywhere in Canada and I found It on line in Toronto with reasonable price. It opens up with warm spicy, Green and floral notes in the background then dry down is sweet powdery, Incense-y, ambery and woody. My wife fell in love with it at first sniff. It is suitable for cold weather. In my opinion , Chergui is a work of art in a bottle, It reminds me of Bazar with Spices in the middle east. This perfume has High Quality Composition and Well-blended. It doesn't smell similar to Baby powder. Please ignore fake comments and reviews, I promise you some of them never smelled it and wrote a review! It doesn't smell similar to Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille because there is no The Tobacco note in this perfume Based on Official Site by Serge Lutens. The Hay , Honey, Incense, Immortal flower and Amber notes are dominant in this Scent. Longevity is above Average. I really enjoy it when the weather is very cold. Please try it before buying. This review is based on the new reformulation bottle If you are looking for a warm spicy Unique Perfume, try it. Highly Recommended.  Two Thumbs Up.  Bravo Serge Lutens! Rating : 8.5 / 10"", 'I love Chergui. I have loved it for over a year, but for some reason my brain has been trying to convince me it\'s not that good of a fragrance recently. Some of the criticisms that went through my head while taking a break from it: - ""The vanilla/amber base is too sweet. I don\'t even like sweet fragrances to begin with"" - ""The iris note is a bit plasticky"" - ""There isn\'t much tobacco in it for a tobacco fragrance"" - ""It\'s difficult to perceive after the first half hour"" - ""The base is present in many Serge Lutens perfumes, it\'s not that distinctive"" - ""The hay note is nice, but not that convincing. I\'d rather wear Milano Fragranze\'s Derby if I want hay"" Then I wore it again and fell in love all over again.  Sometimes my brain just needs to shush.', 'Powdery tobacco like carrot seed in sweet tobacco. I guess it is because of hay note.', 'من أعظم عطور سيرج لوتانس على الإطلاق، في نظري رقم 1 ..\u2028عطر اسطوري، عطر نقل عطور التوباكو نقلة نوعية لم نعهدها من قبل..\u2028', 'What can I say? This is great stuff The hay note is very important as it cuts through the thickness and makes the fragrance more versatile. I would say its an all year round signature but just one spray during warmer days it does ""bloom"" nicely in warm weather meaning the amber becomes really pronounced in a good way kinda ""golden"" smelling if that makes sense. I was debating between this an Ecrin De Fumee which is like the newer more mature more mysterious version of this. Ended up getting this but they both are equally amazing imo This is pretty youthful perfect for mid 20s to mid 30s Overall like a solid 9/10', ""After initial spray. I didnt consider this to be special. Unique yes, but this doesn't really fit me as a person. But then the dry-down kicked in... Yes, this is good. I'd say a like and not a love from my side. It will take some time for you and others to adjust to the profile.  It's a bit daring, but just enough. I can see myself loving this one over time, though. The scent is complex and it will take multiple wearings to understand fully. Don't judge it because of the hype and the initial opening. Wear it a few times. Took my own advice and wore it a few times. This has a baby powder/baby wipes kind of vibe to it as well after I've let it sit for a while. This is a strong love now. At the start I did not get the baby wipes/powder vibes, it it something that came out after multiple wearings. I guess my nose just upgraded in real time haha"", 'oooh this gives me sweet honey soap with hay. like i can realllllyy smell the hay in here and i love it. the hay cuts through the sweetness and gives this perfume its uniqueness. at certain points i get a licorice-like note in this. you have to smell it for yourself its oddly beautiful.', 'After trying so many things, I thought I had reached a certain point, but this fragrance turned me upside down.  I have the black labelled bottle: the newest version. I don\'t remember the old one. Every perfume differs from skin to skin, it differs on the hair and clothes of the same person, but this one is a little more polarising. I will write my impression on the skin because it was very dry and grassy on my hair and I decided not to use it on my hair again. I think it fits its description perfectly: ""Chergui, a hot, dry wind in Morocco coming from the Sahara."" The fragrance has a sweet, dry and spicy opening. I can never describe the tobacco here as tobacco, it is more tobacco-like. In my version, tobacco is not listed. There is immortelle (I think it has a tobacco-y herbal characteristic), leather and hay, but I don\'t think it is limited to this.  If there was labdanum listed instead of leather, it would fit more in my head. I feel a slight herbal vibe in the background. I can even call it medicinal, but not too dominant. Delicate sweetness is always there, but it is not directly honey-like. This is a nectar-like sweetness. It is not overpowering.  In the middle, amber and dried hay starts to come, which I think is the most vital point of the fragrance. These are the elements that make the scent dry and warm. The herbal tone gradually diminishes and is replaced by incense, amber and a sweet note. The smell of hay never leaves it. There is something similar to labdanum, or I am mistaken because I see the leather note. This part is never clear in my head. Although it seems simple, I think this is a very sophisticated fragrance. It has become something I\'ve been thinking about for a while. Longevity and sillage are awesome! Days later, I could still smell it. Unisex or slightly masculine. Suitable for winter.', ""This is a far lighter scent, than I thought it would be, if that makes sense. I love the hay notes, they are so prominent on me, followed by the tobacco ones, but it reminds me of like. A day in the mountain countryside, that's not warm and not cold, just dry and sunny. I really like it, I could def see this as a daily wear scent."", 'تنباکوی سبز و علفی که در شربت ای شیرین و عسلی خوابانده شده ... تمام ارکان این عطر،حس شیرین و پودری دارند از مشک گرفته تا رز و صندل و تنباکو و  انگار تو قلب عطر یک مرد میان سال با تجربه است که خاطره های زیادی برای گفتن داره و عمیق بودن رایحه و پیچیدگی هاش؛چنین شخضیت ای رو برام تداعی می کنه :) الان هم دوستش دارم اما حس می کنم در سنین بالاتر (مثلا 50 به بالا) استقبال گرم تری ازش داشته باشم اگر تا اون زمان تولید اش متوقف نشه  **************** scent:8/10 longevity:6.5/10 sillage:6/10 purchase value:6/10 ******** overall:6.6/10', ""Smells like a clean, slightly floral, syrupy soap. It is not a very complicated scent but it is very classy and smooth. It does not seem to project that much, but I don't think it is intended to. Seems to be a more intimate type of smell. Overall, it is a good scent and to me this falls under a classical type of Fougère. If you don't already have scents that occupy that profile then I would consider giving this a try."", ""What I can say about this is that its timeless. It is elegant, sophisticated and doesn't scream out loud about itself. I would describe it as dried flowers and herbs in very fine sand. Its warm, ambery and spicy, but its also a bit green, fresh and very well crafted. Projection is a bit weak but its nice in the air and stays firmly on skin and for days on clothes."", 'This has a smooth composition. Certainly enjoyable. A tad to sweet for me but i would wear it. For this profile I still prefer Habibi Honeyed Tobacco Oud. But you can get this for a bit less at a discounter. If you want a sweet Tobacco, I would give it a try.', 'I absolutely love this smell. It’s spicy and warm and sweet like maple syrup. I originally got it for myself when I was ordering fragrances online. I found I didn’t enjoy the scent on myself and thought it was far too masculine for my taste so I ended up gifting it to my boyfriend instead and I love when he wears it.  The scent reminds me of Christmas time in a strange way, or a well put together business man in a romance novel. It is extremely strong at first spray, but I found it settles pleasantly and it has a fairly intimate silage.', 'on me this fragrance is super soapy and powdery and reminds me of the early 2000s, it’s very unisex in my opinion ! defo will get a bottle, makes me feel clean but cozy at the same time', ""Chergui remains one of Serge Lutens' masterpieces, and one of the best perfumes I've ever owned. Yes, even after reformulation. Old formulation: ★★★★★★★★★☆ This 50ml bottle was purchased 9 years ago and still has a few mls left. The old Chergui opens with a fresh, slightly sour breeze that quickly yields to a warm, well-balanced blend of tobacco and honey, with subtle woody notes in the background. The honey softens in the drydown, revealing powdery notes. To me the brilliance is really in that the sweet honey balances out the rough, offensive property of dry tobacco leaves. Longevity is excellent, with moderate projection. New formulation: ★★★★★★★★★☆ The new Chergui lists “Immortal Flower, Leather of Russia, Hay” as official notes. Tobacco is notably absent, which is a bold change given the old Chergui’s unofficial reputation as one of the best tobacco fragrances out there. However, the new Chergui does deliver a highly similar atmosphere, which is a pleasant surprise and also the reason why I believe some recent reviews may have been biased by Fragrantica’s outdated note list. There is absolutely NO TOBACCO in the new Chergui. The opening of the new Chergui is quite sharp, alcoholic, and not the most pleasant. I detected incense and even mint. But they quickly transitioned into the main notes of hearty immortelle, dry hay, and leather. As it dries down the hay and leather become more noticeable, creating an arid, powdery finish that’s distinct from the typical baby-powder base found in many perfumes including the old Chergui. Excellent longevity, moderate projection, like the original. To me, the new formulation is an even better embodiment of the concept - a scorching wind in Moroccan deserts. It’s undoubtedly drier, less sweet, and less powdery, but remains irresistibly warm. Understandably, the new Chergui can be a disappointment to tobacco lovers. But for those who appreciate Serge Lutens’ artistry in capturing poetic visions, the new Chergui is definitely something not to miss."", 'Very beautiful ambery tobacco honey scent. I get the hay note which comes through in an uplifting way. I think where ambre sultan goes a little dark and spicier/herby, this one turns sweet (far from cloying) and mildly fresh. I disagree with people calling this ""old,"" but it is mature. My wife liked it and she hates basically every perfume I\'ve ever tried or owned, so that\'s quite an endorsement. It let me down a little in its performance. Put it on at 9 am, smelled it until about 3 pm, and then it just vanished.', 'Smells like an 80s goth which is cool. Unfortunately it is headache-inducing like most fragrances', 'Been wearing and testing for a month while I mull over my opinions on this one. As I am American, there isn’t really any opportunity to smell SL fragrances so I had to blind buy a 10ml (which I NEVER do). While it does smell like the listed notes it completely took me by surprise and smelled nothing like what o expected based on the marketing etc. super dry, powdery honey and almond/cherry up front develops into a very “1990s” style floral bouquet in the mid that dries down into a sort of powdery amber and hay, reminiscent of old dusty cupboards or maybe my grandfathers cigar box (did I mention the tobacco note through-line ?). It smells elegant, and very old school like something a wealthy but traditional eccentric great uncle would wear. As I was expecting a more traditional powdery amber scent a la ottoman amber, this scent is a unique but pleasant departure from expectations and definitely something I will keep for that odd formal special occasion. Truly a special fragrance.', 'Most Serge Lutens fragrances seem more fitting for people over 50, and I mean that in a good way, but I agree with the previous reviewer, this one is giving downright elderly. My least favorite Lutens I’ve sampled tbh. I do like a hay accord, but I much prefer it in something like the Boris Bidjan Saberi scent, which is more avant garde and youthful.', 'Distinct and unique smell, pretty pleasant. Very much recommend this to any men over 70 years old.', ""Too sweet for me, but I agree that it's better than tobacco honey, as this one is more consistent, while it lacks the dazzling opening. I can't take the sweetness, otherwise I'd be able to take it more seriously."", ""A magical amber, hay, and tobacco fragrance. It makes me so indescribably nostalgic wearing it. One of my favorites of all time and might just be Serge Luten's best."", 'This one here have some ""old school vibe"" which either off putting or very attractive.  Particularly, the ""barbershop/ soap"" vibe. This create to me a sharp contrast, because excluding this vibe the fragrance is very nice with good scent profile.  Since it\'s affordable or good price/value disposition, coupled with ok performance, it\'s the type of fragrance you just snap in your pocket for all casual wear and avoid to make some dent on your favourite fragrances.:) Very versatile, yet interesting scent.', 'When this dries down, it smells like a full bodied and honestly much better version of untitled by margiela’s opening. Where that fragrance falls flat immediately after, and basically just smells like synthetic musks, this one keeps all the character throughout its whole wear. Ive smelled multiple tobacco honey fragrances and even though its not my style i can get behind them. Chergui however has to be the most perfect one. Powdery, warm, cozy, naturalistic, not too sweet, enveloping, green, sophisticated. So good. Maybe one day i’ll buy this, and i definitely recommend it to people who love scents like this. I just dont think it personally suits me as a wearer', 'Oh wow!! Just received a 10mil sample of this and I’m absolutely in love! Very heady and creamy amber, slightly spicy but not as much as Ambre’ Sultan or Amber Absolute. This is gorgeous beyond words. Perfect for a Michigan winter. This is wearable every season except for summer. Thankfully, it’s borderline sweet but it never crosses that line. This is for more mature folks. Not dated, just more mature. This is a beast and definitely full bottle worthy.', 'smoky tobacco and honey with a touch of lipstick? the best way to describe this fragrance is like opening a woman’s purse filled with lipstick, makeup powder, a marlboro gold pack, and honey candies. it has a distinctly vintage vibe.', 'This is better than tobacco honey by Guerlain. Its sweet, smooth, well blended, sexy, and addictive.', 'Wore this for Christmas yesterday. 7 sprays in total. Applied around 10am and went to family and friends houses throughout the day. Lots of hugs and lots of compliments. Next to Tobacco Vanille, this is the best holiday fragrance you can wear! Cheers!!', 'Very very powdery. Almost like a baby powder smell. The opening is pretty bad until the drydown where it gets better', ""such a complex and edgy fragrance. The opening can be a bit off putting, kind of spicy medicinal (that I enjoy ngl), I also get clove notes even though it's not listed. I don't get any prominent floral accords. Once it sits down for about 5 minutes you'll start smelling the boozy sweetness that comes from the honey, mixed with tobacco leaves (that add earthiness, not much smokiness) and resinous amber.  It settles down sweet but verrry dry, I assume the dryness comes from the hay note which is pretty prominent. It kinda reminds me of the smell of old Persian rugs collecting dust in an antique store. The dry down is less medicinal and sharp; the notes are well rounded, ambery smooth and smoky with a hint of spicy sharpness. It's sweet but not cloying, it almost smells like dried fruits to me without smelling like any fruit lmao. Chergui is perfectly unisex, great for autumn and winter. I now understand why this perfume is considered a classic in the fragrance community. Be aware though, it's definitely NOT a blind buy, especially if you're new to less mainstream / niche perfumes."", 'عطر رسمي قوي وجميل ليس للإستخدام اليومي إنما عطر للمناسبات في ليالي الشتاء الباردة ،، يوجد بالعطر نوتة ""التبن"" مزعجة وشاذة ولا داعي لها ، كان العطر سيكون أجمل بدونها', ""Finally and belatedly I was able to get to know another classic of perfumery, I won't try to develop so much because Chergui has been widely known by the community for a long time, especially by the old people. I found it an excellent perfume, a warm fragrance, a sweet sweet, very cloying fragrance, a subtle tobacco wrapped in a sticky honey without being cloying. It is very evident to me a green hay accord that I really like in fragrances. Finally, a thin incensed/smokey aura arrives, not at all oppressive, with a backdrop mixed with the amber accord. Super balanced fragrance. Chergui is a Perfume that is super elegant in mild temperatures, I would easily have a bottle."", 'Layering Combinations Chergui + Tobacco Vanille 2 sprays Chergui : 1 spray Tobacco Vanille. Both share tobacco sweetness, but Tobacco Vanille’s rich vanilla enhances Chergui’s smooth honey and amber. This combination is warm, smoky, and luxurious. perfect for evening/night, formal events or cozy gatherings.', 'I will back up at least 3 bottles of this… It like a drug to me. Chergui is the most addictive tobacco scent I’ve ever come across. Received couple of compliments from family already.', 'I dislike this scent for the same reason I dislike tobacco vanille - its an overly sweet, overly thick scent. Imagine a thick vanilla and tobacco scent with a thick honey undertone. However, I do surprisingly find this more pleasant than tobacco vanille. 1.9/10 imo', ""This and un bois vanille have the same baby wipe smelling powdery accord. I love it personally but it could put others off! I really like this. Warm but not sweet, cozy, powdery. Really kinda perfectly up my alley. If I finish my decant I'd absolutely get a FB."", 'This is an outstanding scent!  I have often heard this described as a tobacco fragrance, and I bought a full bottle as a gift for someone who loves tobacco fragrances. I picked up a sample for myself too and just tried it. I’m really surprised because it’s really uncharacteristic for me to love a tobacco fragrance this much.  Interestingly, Fragrantica lists a tobacco note, but the Serge Lutens website doesn’t. SL do list an Immortelle note. Now that I read that, I am able to pick it out from what I am smelling. That familiar note I had thought was tobacco, was actually immortelle that I remember in Guerlain Angelique Noir ( one of my ultra favs). So I have to wonder if this is really a tobacco fragrance. The honey and immortelle seem to be doing the heavy lifting in the beginning and the powdery iris adds some comforting fluffiness later. Maybe there a bit of tobacco in there because I do detect a sharp dimension occasionally, but I would not call this a tobacco fragrance because of it.  In any case, I’m just happy it exists. The spicy, slightly aromatic, dry, honeyed exotic scent profile is thick, heady and cozy in ways that makes me want to bury my nose in my shirt for the rest of the day.  Wearing it on this cold evening is heaven. Many thanks to its creators who can rest assured that I’m getting my own bottle now because it’s so affordable ;-)', 'I live for the powdery dry down on this. That’s what this fragrance is all about for me. It’s not a cosmeticy powder or a baby powder; it’s a dry hay powder with a little tobacco smoke (not much) and it’s heavenly. Lasts 12 plus hours on skin. This is one of those perfumes that is a no brainer and works for every occasion.', ""I finally sampled this today and the first 30-60 minutes are a dream. Couldn't stop smelling my wrist. But the dry-down is SO similar to Shade by Lush and that was nagging at me so much. I'll try it again now that I've made the connection because I'm unsure if I disliked the scent or was just annoyed that I couldn't figure it out."", 'This is kind of medicinal sweet tobacco. Pleasant fragrance. It was released in 2001 so today you can expect similar fragrances in market.', 'Such a warm, complex fragrance. Amber with undulating tendrils of green, in a room with incense-soaked walls. The hay is fresh, herbaceous, and sings against the warmer elements. As it wears, honey lends heat while the tobacco leaf gives the composition body.  Chergui is one of those scents that becomes an archetype in the mind, a pillar against which other fragrances might compare. A solid thing. This fragrance is unique but it feels necessarily so, as though it couldn’t have been made any other way. There’s almost a nostalgia to it, warm and inviting, yet powerful in its way. Chergui carries of sense of having lived, of experience, something bold and ancestral and secret. A beautiful fall/winter fragrance.', 'To me- someone who grew up in Kentucky, this fragrance is nostalgic and smells like a day at Keeneland (horse racing venue) in a bottle. You’re waiting for a race to begin on an unusually warm fall day, wafts of sweet feed and hay float in on the breeze, the gentleman to your left lights an expensive cigar and the lady to your right in the extravagant hat smells heavily of a powdery scent from the 80’s. It’s an intoxicating blend of sophistication, warmth and animalic charm. I find that both my husband and I can wear this and it transforms into something unique and nuanced on us both. On him, I get more of the sweet tobacco and green - while on me I get more of a honeyed amber meets traditional powder. Either way this fragrance is addictive and a great place to start with Serge Lutens.', ""Stock samples sent by my perfume rep. Initially, a carded sample gave a generic cherry tobacco impression.  Somewhat lack - luster.  Happened to toss it into a weekender. Cooler Fall mountain trek. After a spa soak, spritzed a little of this jam on. And well . . .  Ten minutes later, and the hay, honey and tobacco pose remarkable similarity to Vinyle Yves Saint Laurent 2016.  Imortelle and polished oak prevail in Vinyle, while Chergui's a waxy cherrywood cushion sectioned off with vip brass velvet ropes.  Faintly powdery amber is where it's at, before some sour cherry twangs.  Fortunately there is Chergui, though. Vinyle YSL is hard to come by."", ""I wanna smell like… Brisk winter evening standing outside your city's Opera House in a formidable fur coat while your honey lights up your hand-rolled cigarette. A night cap at your neighborhood speakeasy with a tinge of quiet seduction."", 'A spectacular fragrance. Warm and inviting, rich honey meets a dry, smoky tobacco. There are hints of powdery iris throughout, a perfectly blended fragrance.', 'I got a sample of this at one point with a sephora order and was immediatly OBSESSED. I wound up spending the whole thing spraying it on my pillows because it was so divine. This is what I want my man to smell like. It is so sexy, warm, cozy, while still being slightly understated.', 'Heard amazing reviews about this, but unfortunately, it’s just too sweet for me. The tobacco and honey combination is too harsh and overpowering like I actually gagged when I smelled this... :(', 'Chergui by Serge Lutens is a masterpiece of warmth and depth. It opens with a blend of rich honey and smoky tobacco that feels both cozy and exotic. The spices are perfectly balanced with a touch of sweetness, creating a scent that’s both comforting and mysterious. As it dries down, the soft incense and amber notes reveal a sensual, almost velvety base. It’s a scent that feels like a warm embrace on a chilly evening, complex yet approachable. If you’re looking for something timeless, luxurious, and unforgettable, Chergui is an absolute must-try.', 'idk but it reminds me of couros too much', ""I tried this on today and was actually a little disappointed. This scent is billed as a tobacco lover's dream, but I didn't get much tobacco. In fact, it was mostly amber and honey. There were also some sweet floral elements as well, but mostly amber and honey. I could try this again, but I only tried it because I wanted to smell like sweet Carolina chewing tobacco."", 'I do not understand the hype for this fragrance. I don’t get tobacco at all, or amber or hay either. I just get powdery, nondescript florals and sweetness; like the blend of smells when you walk down the baby aisle of a super market. Just pick up a pack of pampers, tear the plastic, and give it a squeeze and you’ve got this.', 'Reminds me of shalimar, although i havent worn it in years', ""I tested this at the department store and I can't stop thinking about it. One day I'll buy this!"", 'Way too sweet for me. I do like Lutens, though.', ""I tend to not like amber fragrances which is why it took me a long time to try Chergui on my skin, despite Serge Lutens being one of my favorite houses. I definitely get the hype. It's bold and yet incredibly smooth and inviting. The drydown is super elegant. A true masterpiece. Not sure if it's a love yet, but I'll certainly sample it more."", ""Oh this is a real fall fragrance. Opens up smoky and balsamic, then settles down into a medley of tobacco, powder, incense and hay. The amber-floral base softens it and the honey sweetens it just a little bit. It's very warm, inviting, cozy yet reserved, and I'd even say mature. Wear this if you want to feel like a 19th century writer, sitting in an office of beautifully carved wooden furniture, smoking a cigar and preparing to read through a stack of letters from lands and countries far far away."", 'I’ve always been able to see why Chergui is often recommended as a gateway type of niche perfume: it’s different enough from the usual designer fragrance profiles yet very easy on the nose. It’s sweet but still clearly unisex. It’s cozy and refined at the same time, so a great way to introduce the idea of a seasonal scent while retaining versatility for occasion; Chergui is just as applicable to a black-tie event as it is to casual wear. Subjectively speaking, I like Chergui quite a bit and wear it here and there, but there is a powdery aspect that keeps it in the realm of appreciation for me more than actual love.', 'Smells like baby wipes to me', 'Beautiful fragrance. The opening is bright for a few seconds at the start then it starts to deepen, I get a woodiness, sweet, something slightly sharp, then a deep honey note. The incense note is present throughout. The floral notes don’t stand out to me individually.  I only have a 2ml sample at the moment but I keep going back to it, so enjoyable!', 'Serge Lutens Chergui is a rich, warm fragrance that feels like a gentle breeze across a desert at sunset. The opening is a blend of smoky tobacco and sweet honey, which meld beautifully with spicy undertones and a touch of hay. As it develops, the scent reveals soft, powdery iris and a whisper of incense, adding depth and complexity. The dry down is warm and comforting, with notes of amber, musk, and sandalwood providing a smooth, sensual finish. Chergui is a captivating scent, perfect for those who appreciate deep, cozy fragrances that evoke both mystery and warmth.', 'powdery, sweet, honey and mostly tobacco ♡ pretty, but not my thing. Linear', 'Just got a sample of this one, it’s elegant and somber. I get tobacco and incense from this, but it’s sharp rather than deep. The opening has a tiiiiiiny hint of… tires? new car? medicine? idk. it settles into this powdery smell that seems characteristic of a steezy 45-year old woman or a man with a dark secret. i like it and i will not be buying more. i may update after a while', 'Okay so I’ve owned this for a while now, and let me tell you I wasn’t the biggest fan when I first came across it. It was syrupy and a bit too much like a dusty dried fruit, which was hard to stomach. HOWEVER As I’ve owned it and let it sit for a while this fragrance has become my everything. I now get a super smooth, luscious tobacco, almost vanillic which I love for the winter months. The dusty dried fruit note that I used to get has changed for the better, making it the slightest bit sweet. To me, this fragrance is the most elegant wool coat embrace, actually a beautiful scent that I will never get tired of wearing.', ""When I first smelt this a few years ago it was one of my most hated fragrances but since retrying this year I've come to really like it. The opening spray strangely smells a bit like Aeroguard, but it quickly dries down to this lovely rich tobacco note with a hint of warm leather. After about 30 minutes - 1 hour it reminds me of holidays in the bush, surrounded by dry earth. Imagine sitting around a campfire but without the smoky scent. The hay is very noticeable in this, and paired with the amber / honey note it becomes this sweet / earthy accord that is nostalgic and intoxicating."", 'The desert wind in a bottle, warm and mysterious… Wrapped in the golden hour’s glow, it’s a ride through sun-drenched dunes and smokey twilight. 🌙🔥 Sweet tobacco and honey swirl together, creating a cozy cocoon. Perfect for those days and nights when you want to stand out without even trying… This one doesn’t speak—it whispers elegance. Timeless. Unapologetic.🔥', ""Warm and comforting. To me, I get a warm, tobacco-honey-lavender, despite lavender not even being listed as a note. It feels like a warm hug. It's very linear and smells almost antiquated, in the best way.  I think I really hyped this one up on my mind as I expected to be wow'ed, instead it's just enjoyable and a safe buy if you like the notes listed."", ""I was a little worried this was going to be too syrupyor dense for normal wear, but I was wrong. Chergui is the cleanest, powderiest honey-tobacco I've ever smelled. It smells like a memory. It's light. dry, floaty. They hay and honey in here are wonderfully realistic. I actually wish it was denser because the performance is a bit lackluster, but as a personal scent I'm really liking this."", ""It's ok, nothing much to say about this. a bit generic for me. A bit hyped up if you ask me, there are much better Serge Lutens perfumes out there."", 'Upon looking at the notes of Chergui, you would expect a sweet, warm and cosy scent. When in actual fact, Chergui is far fresher and brighter than I was expecting. I don’t love it as much as I thought I would, but I suppose the scent I’m smelling is far beyond what I had pictured - I do find I am enjoying it the more I smell it. The official Serge Lutens website lists the notes as Immortelle, Russian Leather and Hay. These are what speak to me the most. Having smelled imortelle in its natural form not too long ago, this scent instantly takes me back to that moment - it’s incredibly dry, soft and slightly grassy, with these facets elevated with the inclusion of hay and tobacco. There is a warmth on the base from the leather, amber and a touch of sweet honey - but this is subtle. Overall Chergui is a strangely dry and vegetal scent, reminiscent of the smell of Mediterranean vegetation in the wilderness. As I said it’s a lot fresher and lighter than I expected initially, but I’ve really grown to appreciate the simplistic beauty of immortelle and hay together, there’s nothing else in my collection which smells quite like it.', 'Not what I hoped for. I was hoping for a more masculine blend of tobacco and honey that would be ideal for fall and winter. Instead I was met with a soft, powdery, unisex fragrance in the realm of Habit Rouge and Jaipur Pour Homme. It leans heavily into a dandy, sensitive vibe, better suited for a man with a softer, more emotional personality or a woman. Unfortunately, the honey and tobacco notes are not accentuated enough. It’s a very linear baby powder-like scent with almost no progression, offering nothing interesting from start to finish.  Given its price point, I’d honestly recommend opting for Jaipur, which delivers a similar vibe at a much better value. On a positive note, the performance is solid. It lasts over 5 hours on the skin and easily 12+ hours on clothing.', ""What's left to say about this - spice, cardamom, coffee, tobacco, honey. Entirely flat with very little movement beyond the initial spray. Small, but delicious, projection throughout the day."", 'this scent is unbelievably sexy, gives off a really sweet shisha molasses vibe', 'This is gorgeous. One of the first times that all of the notes listed on here make perfect sense. Doesn’t have major projection but it’s so delicious on the skin I can’t stop smelling it. It manages to keep that tobacco note without being cloying and smokey. Feels really nostalgic to me. It’s the perfect choice for someone who wants a effortlessly sexy scent.', 'First sniff: cinnamon! Perfect for autumn and winter. Perfectly smoothly bended, well-balanced!', ""I got my bottle of Serge Lutens Chergui several months back but only used it for the first time today, as I wanted to wait for suitable temperatures. We've been having cool, rainy weather the past few days so I thought this would be the perfect time to try it out. It was certainly worth the wait. Chergui is the smoothest, most well-rounded tobacco I've smelled thus far. The sweet honey balances it out, leaving no rough edges. It settles into a cozy haze that might be too powdery for some people's liking, but it's just right for me. Its genteel manner is full of class. I can see why this is considered a masterpiece."", ""This is my first bottle from this house. I didn't like it at first because I found it a bit too powdery. The main notes I can smell are honey and hay. The tobacco is quite light, I can only detect it up close. The iris and incense make it powdery. Personally, the opening smells very ambery, which reminds me of Soul Batik, even though they don't smell the same. It lasts about 8 hours on my skin and much longer on clothes, but not loud. I find this fragrance sexy, yet elegant. Scent: 9.5/10 Projection: 7.5/10 Longevity: 9/10"", 'What everyone has said in this review section is true. This is such a good scent! A true masterpiece with just the right amount of je ne sais quoi. I cant distinguish anything else other than the hay and honey, but whatever else there is, it’s still so damn good! So warm and so balanced! Scent is able to last all day. Ugh what a dream. This scent is what I imagine it would smell like on a warm afternoon in the Italian countryside.', 'Chergui by Serge Lutens feels like stepping into a warm, smoky breeze on a late summer evening. It’s thick with sweet honey, smooth tobacco, and a touch of dried fruit, creating a rich, dense atmosphere. From the start, you get hay and spices, like sun-soaked fields far away, and the tobacco is gentle, adding just a whisper of smoke. As the scent settles, hints of powdery iris and incense bring a soft touch. Finally, it becomes a warm, comforting blend of amber, musk, and sandalwood—cozy yet a bit mysterious. It wears close to the skin, making it perfect for cool nights when you want to feel wrapped in something comforting and intriguing. It’s not for everyone, but that’s what makes Chergui special. It carries Serge Lutens’ style—melancholic, romantic, and full of depth. Ideal for evening wear when you want to stand out in a subtle, memorable way.', ""Not sure why I waited so long to get this, what an amazing scent, the hay note comes through beautifully blended with the honey, iris and slight hint of tobacco that makes this incredibly well rounded, my bottle is a newer batch, I get really good performance with it of anywhere between 8-10 hours, not even joking, this a strong one. My grandmother used to own an antiques shop where she'd sell all sort of gadgets, jewellery and incense, I can still remember the incense smell lingering around the shop and this gives me a very similar vibe to it, nostalgic and mysterious."", ""Citronella in the first three minutes followed by hours of powdery honey-tobacco-hay bliss. Iconic.  Projection is not too far, maybe a foot at the most, and even though it's a warm, personal scent it's also clean so I think it could be worn safely in a work setting.  Leans masculine, but I love wearing it. Layers well with rose"", ""Starts off as the the best bug spray you've ever smelled, and becomes something much more subtle than I anticipated. There is a lovely medicinal edge in the honey and hay, softened in powder. Really sings in the dry down, a gentle tobacco. It reminds of late summer and dry sweet grasses."", 'At first spray, an unsettling moment. It\'s very strong and very balsamy; I didn\'t expect that. Very quickly, Chergui changes and becomes attractive. The balsamy aspect is still there but, despite what the pyramid says, I smell a fairly strong vanilla note appearing, then a fresh note added (could it be the herbaceous aspect of the hay?). We could maybe talk about ""vanilla honey"". Everything leans towards the oriental vanilla ointment, warm and spicy but with a fresh note. A very beautiful perfume that I really like. However, the smell is very familiar to me and it will only take me a few more seconds to make the connection; it bears a disturbing resemblance to Fragonard\'s Grain de Soleil. Nuances obviously remain but they are minimal (I find the fresh note much more important in Chergui for example). Of course, I tested it on my skin so maybe on yours it will be different but as far as I\'m concerned, the price difference between the two has already convinced me; I keep the Fragonard.', ""I just got Chergui along with Amouage Black Iris. Black Iris is good, but I like Chergui even better. I only spray on clothes, rarely on skin. With Chergui, the stars of the show up front to my nose are Honey, Tobacco, and Hay, with all the other notes propping it up in the background, combining to make such an addictive scent. It is powdery yes, and I'm usually not a fan of powdery, but in this fragrance i think it just adds to its beauty in a way. This is one of those fragrances that is so masterfully blended that you can actually pick out every single note that is in it at times. I love the opening and the dry down. I think its totally unisex. Think ambery, powdery-hay-honey scent with a tiny bit of tobacco, iris, rose, incense(in that order from most to least). etc to make it so unique, lovely, and complex smelling. Sweet powdered, honey, tobacco. Immediately into my top 3 favorites along with Lune Feline, and Merecedes Benz Club Black. Yeah, I'm a gourmand guy. Chergui has this medicinal spicey quality to it that makes it totally mesmerizing. What else can I say about Chergui...it is everything a top notch niche fragrance should be and more for a decent price. Might have to get a back up bottle of this. I can see some people not liking Chergui for it's powderiness, or for smelling too mature or something, but if you've been into fragrances for a while and know what you're smelling then you'll probably like this....alot."", ""On first application I did not like this fragrance. I saw so many people raving over it online and saying it was the perfect fall fragrance; I think I expected more traditional notes like soft spices, vanillas, etc. Fortunately I wore it several times since and it has really grown on me. It has a vintage feel to it; it evokes a crisp October afternoon right before sunset in the 80s or 90s. It is a little powdery, a little spicy, a little sweet. I can pick up the hay and the honey; the tobacco is a spicey, peppery tobacco. It's very comforting!"", ""I must say, in all honesty, that this smells a bit like Naxos. It's the powdery tobacco honey-ness. Yet instead of the lavender in Naxos, this has something else. I don't know what it is, but it's nice. It's warm and ambery. It's very much for someone more mature, but you know, we all wear whatever we want, whenever. In my opinion, I'd rather wear this than Naxos. 9/10"", 'The community is right, this fragrance is a masterpiece. It perfectly captures the feeling of golden hour – that warm, inviting time of day when the temperature is just right. Not cold or warm. The blend of notes is beautiful and comforting, making it a must-try for everyone.', ""Its quite pleasant, like a sweeter and more tolerable Écrin de Fumée. It smells like pipe tobacco and ambery honey on the dry down. There is absolutely a hay note in there too. This is a more mature scent as it is more incense-y and musky than it is sweet. Don't expect sweetness like Tobacco Vanille."", 'Ugh. I’m almost 100% positive that I have the reformulation. Years ago, I met with a guy friend who introduced me to Chergui - it was the softest and warmest amber I have smelled. It’s my fault to have waited until this year to finally add it to my collection. The initial spray was underwhelming. It did not remind me of the moment I smelled it for the first time. Instead, I smelled something utterly masculine and iffy amber. So I let it macerate for weeks. It’s the same. There’s no distinct aroma. It smells like a ton of masculine colognes in one. The crew top sprayer is alright but the original lid keeps rolling out of the box - am I doing something wrong ? Hahaha!  Also, after hours, I totally forget I am wearing it. I take my clothes off and the scent has disappeared. The staying power is 5/10. Age appropriate: 30+ Unisex OK for school or office.', ""It's like- if you found a crayon that'd rolled under a church pew and collected dust for a few months...  All i get on my skin for hours is wax/plastic and a spicy note. But not the kind that appeals to me. Not a floral insence with any smoky nuance. More like... stale and peppery. Perhaps it's the tobacco.  I get a slight amber/powder after a few hours.  But it's not pleasant or worth it.  I may have the kind of skin chemistry that amber doesn't work on? I'm still new to fragrance... But that's my two cents.  There's 0 sweetness in this on me. Or even when i smelled from the tester... It's just- not for me."", ""When I first got into perfumes in 2008, Chergui is what the niche-enthusiasts were constantly raving about. I got the coolest opportunity to attend a perfume event at Neiman Marcus in Dallas with other online forum-dwellers, and I left with so many samples of Serge Lutens, L'Artisan, Creed, and Comme des Garcon and a new appreciation for niche. My avid 19-year-old self felt so very cultured, lol. Niche was way out of my league back then, and oddly, I fell out of the perfume game that year. But I'm back, and I always thought about Chergui (also Arabie).  Chergui is the ultimate fall fragrance to me, like the token fall sweater of perfumery. It's enveloping in a unique way... dry, but smooth. Warming and caressing amber-tobacco, sweet honey-sandalwood, with the fantastic addition of hay that makes it special...all on a musky cloud. It's perfectly unisex.  I'm so happy to revisit Chergui. It's like reliving my passion all over again.  I'm sad to hear it was reformulated... I don't remember well enough to make any comparisons between old Chergui formula and the one I'm trying today. I can say that my decant very much smells like Chergui, though... that's for sure. It may be weaker? But I still love it."", ""Incredible fragrance. I'm pretty shocked that people don't compare it to Naxos. On my skin it is VERY similar. At least the tobacco honey combo. This is bold, powerful, strong. Performance is excellent. I find this very masculine."", 'I don’t often review, but I’m compelled by Chergui because I love it and because it’s so intensely hard to nail down just what makes it so intoxicating. First thing you should absolutely know if you haven’t smelled it is that it’s extremely powdery right from the jump. I’m a big masculine guy and for some like me, that may turn you off to it. But the real beauty of this fragrance is its evolution. At this point I should probably add this disclaimer: I most enjoy this fragrance after a shower and in the hours before bed. I say that because it has a really wonderful, comforting and beautiful scent that you would adore as you relax at night at home. That’s not to say I wouldn’t or haven’t worn this out, because I have; and ladies LOVE this. As this scent wears on, the powder dissipates and the honey tobacco starts peeking through and it’s just warm and delightful. Truly a great scent. I won’t bore you with a whole essay on this, but I think it’s an EXTREMELY safe blind buy if what I described is up your alley. It’s 100% a fragrance for a man or woman', 'Definitely a unisex fragrance. I’m not sure why there are men here saying it’s too masculine. I bought a bottle and totally adore it. I bet this would pair well with something like apple cider, vanilla, orange, or raspberry. It’d be perfect if it had a date note in it. Nothing too sweet, though by itself, it’s well worth the price of a nice little fall scent. The tobacco note is definitely there, but it doesn’t smell like a gross tavern at noon. I think the honey compliments it well. Probably a safe blind buy if you like fall scents.', 'Love at first sniff. For me, it is the scent of late summer, early autumn. A scent very similar to the Goose Creek Auburn Lake candle.', 'Siano, bursztyn, miód, zatopione w dużej puszce z pudrem. Tytoniu tam nie ma wcale.  Kupować z dużą ostrożnością, bo to niestandardowy unisex z tendencją jednak do perfum damskich.', 'Incredible scent, silage, projection, longevity. Neighbor wanted name, pictures of bottle, etc. and will be buying it. Safe blind buy.', 'Serge Lutens #2 - Autumn Leaves, Dry Landscapes Chergui - a dry wind coming from the Sahara Desert, blowing over Morocco. With a name like that, and the scentprofile of the fragrance, Serge Lutens pretty much pointed the way for us on how to interpret this perfume. It so happens that right now one of the most popular blockbuster movies is Dune Part Two and thats where my mind wandered when i first sprayed this fragrance. The scent reminds me of elements from the movie, namely: the spice that is so coveted, the Fremen people and their traditions, the sepia colors.  The fragrance starts with a hum of soft spices, a mellow and warm, calm airyness. After the opening, im picking up on the powdery sweet bedrock that the fragrance sits upon. It is a combination of amber, sandalwood, incense and iris...all of them powdery/creamy notes. The tobacco, honey and hay adds flavour but this needs a few sprays to bloom.  Compared to Grand Soir, Chergui is a more dusty, airy amber. Compared to Naxos and Red Tobacco this is a calm and meditative honey and tobacco, alot less brash then both. Its less sweet then the ones i just mentioned, it is almost tea-like, because of the superbly done honey and spices. The honey is there to give a direction to the sweetness but its gentle enough to not overpower or turn ""sticky"" as honey fragrances sometimes do. Out of everything i own, i would put it in the same family with Musc Ravageur (which is dirtier) and Jaipur Homme EDP, and thats due to the overall soft sweet tonality of the scent. Since i own those two, i don\'t know if i\'ll get Chergui but its not out of the question eighter. Chergui is not a loud ""airhorn"" blasting off the skin, its rather like a deep and resonating chant coming from a monk\'s temple, or if i were to bring up Dune yet again, think of the Sardaukar chanting. The quality of the composition needs no mentioning, it all feels natural, smooth and polished. Its not a summer or warm weather fragrance. A bit too dense for that. However, being a rather shy fragrance, atleast judging from my first impressions, im curious if it can whitstand negative temperatures. I think it would work in autumn and spring perfectly.  Personally, i confess that as im testing more and more fragrances, i noticed that olfactively i like sharper, more clearcut scents that are more pronounced. Having said that, i carry alot of respect for scents like this (ambery, resinous, warm spicy fragrances) but its a different kind of appreciation on my part. To make an analogy, visually you might better appreciate the aesthetics of a beautifully designed modern building but looking upon a church or a cathedral will bring out another kind of solemn appreciation. If you are a religious person that is. A fresh, citrusy, modern fragrance will please my nose, but an incense and amber fragrance will speak to my soul.', ""Dry and warm, I get flavoured pipe tobacco and old fashioned talcum powder.  I like it but it's weirdly smells like roasted peanuts.  it sits in this space where it feels like a dandy masculine or a butch femme."", 'Chergui  This was I believe my second or third SL fragrance. As you can see by my wall, they aren’t even all up there, but I absolutely love this house and the noses who’ve worked there in the past. I don’t know how it’s gonna be now, but it was awesome.  This fragrance perfectly straddles the line between male and female. Perfectly unisex. If you’re a woman who Is daring with fragrance. This is such a fantastic scent. The first time I smelled it, I thought it was revolting. I guess it just needed a little air because I fell in love with it almost immediately after that it was so unusual and especially on a woman. my mother smelled it and she had to have a bottle when we went to France! Take my word for it don’t buy it in France, lol but they do use little origami papers for their samplings is a beautiful Store. There’s just something about this one that always makes me come back to it.

Beautiful.', ""This fragrance exudes exceptional quality with its dark, rich aroma, distinct from Tobacco Vanille and even darker than Herod. While it may not appeal to everyone—I myself was initially unsure about it—it has grown on me to the point where I'm considering investing in a full bottle."", 'Was so excited for this but unfortunately I cannot get past the opening metallic twinge that appears on me. Additionally, the note that is new to me is only the hay and idk if this is the culprit here or something else, but something about this reminds me of cockroach spray.

The black is yum, but the white is exquisite- why on earth would they change it....', ""I adore the scent of this fragrance. It's reminiscent of tobacco drying in a barn, with a cozy dry down of amber. However, I wish its performance on my skin was better. Overall, I'd rate it 7 out of 10."", 'Man.. this is something else. This fragrance is very manly.. i cant imagine when or how a woman can wear this. First 2 hours you get hay,amber,tobacco and honey  2-5 hours you get incense and sandalwood. 5-10 hours you get A LOT of rose,musk and iris.

I’ve tried 2 out of 3 and both have been lovely!', ""For me, the best tobacco scent. A legend. Don' t buy TF vanilla tobacco till you try this one."", 'This is a sweet hay and amber first before it is a tobacco fragrance. The tobacco is a light fresh blond unlit cigarette. An elegant light and sweet tobacco, which I can appreciate, but I prefer heavy boozy, spicy, thick tobacco so it isn’t exactly what I usually look for.  I like it more on the dry down when the hay relaxes a bit. If you like Naxos and think hay sounds nice this might be up your alley.', 'Chergui (pronounced SHER-GI) by Serge Lutens Opening has strong incense and hay notes which give it a cold, metallic initial feel. Depending on how warm the air is, these notes may linger or even dominate the whole opening up to mid and base drydown, or in warmer weather quickly give way to the warmer, sweeter notes (Iris, rose, musk). Drydown goes into the fresh tobacco leaf - it is more vegetal, and not at all ""ashtray"" tobacco, which makes it a very good pair with the fresh, floral honey note and rose. While the opening is bold, strong and projecting, towards the drydown the scent withdraws much closer to the skin. Performance is i would say, while dependent on personal skin chemistry and air temperature, average to below average - this is a very natural scent, with no trace of the typical synthetic aroma chemicals that are usually used to boost performance in modern perfumery. The upside to this is great natural smelling notes, with the obvious downside of weaker performance, that is not usually associated with the scent profile. Price for me was beyond great - got a 50ml tester for about 50 euro. And the quality i get from it is incomparable to the modern designer ""elixir"" craze and their outrageous asking prices.  This is, in the end, beautiful, artistic perfumery - bold, uncompromising and not afraid to turn some less experienced noses away.', 'Was wondering about that ""hay"" note when I first heard about Chergui. It kept popping up as a recommendation on Fragrantica based on stuff I already enjoy. So, I thought, why not give it a sniff? Instantly fell in love. And that hay? Yeah, I totally got it, but it\'s not your average barnyard smell. It\'s like a fancy, upscale and luxurious version of hay. Chergui has this vintage vibe without feeling old-fashioned. It\'s classy but not stuffy, you know? It\'s got this sweet, tobacco-amber thing going on that\'s just right—definitely not overpowering, but it sticks around for a while. It reminded me of Lagerfeld Classic, but like a modernized, updated, and niche take on it. And more unisex.  A real hidden treasure in the fragrance world, if you ask me.', 'The Amber note in Chergui reminds me of the Amber used in Grand Soir by MFK. Opulent, spicy, luxurious very rich with oriental quality. Take this Amber and add dry spices.  Dry, spicy, opulent. As grand soir this is not for everyone and this is not suited for all occasion. Leans Masculine in my opinion. I can see a wealthy charismatic man smoking a cigar in a luxurious bar. (Tommy Shelby would rock this)', ""This was the first time to try Chergui as a 'perfume' in around 10 or 11 years, I was still in Kwai Chung last time I got to try it, as my 5 ml Surrender to Chance (literally 'Evaporate to Chance') sample evaporated, leaving a 1 or 2 ml sludge of essential oil with NO sprayability, basically an attar of Chergui. The tobacco is MUCH tamer in the perfume version, and the honey is subdued, but I imagine the sludge I've been smearing this last decade has matured in a different way to the alcohol base version. Aaanyway, this is mostly amber, an Amber Loup amber, with a slight tinge of Nag Champa incense about it, pleasant, but not mind blowing. Folded into Ustfur, with chamomile and milk, OMG yes..."", 'I had Chergui 15 years ago, I bought a new bottle this year.

I have been wishing to try it for the longest time, and while I imagined it might be a heavy, blazing tobacco like that in Tobacolor, Opus XVI Royal Tobacco or Smoking Hot, in reality it's much tamer, sweet and herbaceous. Those fragrances smell like decadent nights spent in dark bars, swaying in a haze of cigarettes and sweet whisky, while Chergui smells like running through sunlit fields in the last days of summer, over dry, chocolatey soil, flowers and grass turning golden, wisps of smoke from distant fires tinting the evening a shade darker."", ""Absolutely awful.

I first tried this in a stuffy, overcrowded Harrods perfume hall where all the fragrances had blinded my senses and I wanted so desperately to escape.

Reminded me of a vintage blush. Twenty minutes later, still powdery but there's finally a bit of tobacco there, though it's barely noticeable. An hour later, it finally settled into a strange blend of powdery rose, honey, and tobacco. I don't get much hay. It gave me the image of a winter evening; you're applying makeup backstage in preparation for a 1920s jazz performance, and all your colleagues are chatting and smoking around you. Flapper costumes. Not exactly what I was looking for, but nice. I bought it anyway. One day later and I'm not sure if I regret it... the scent continues to perplex me. It's like it can't decide on what it wants to be. When I first applied it this morning I was disappointed. It was nowhere near as nice as the day before and I was worried the perfume hall had temporarily rendered me tasteless. Half an hour later, I'm starting to like it again. The tobacco is way stronger and the perfume is far spicier than the day before. Still powdery, but also spicy.

I find this much less linear when comparing the two. I get tobacco (which I'm a sucker for) and honey from the top. There is incense to give the tobacco smoky kick. Strangely clean for what this is, I suspect it's from the mixture of hay and sandalwood. This has a beautiful blend of subtle iris with a faint rose on my skin.

I’m in Paris for work (I know sounds pretentious) but I went to SL store with the intention of buying MKK … but I sprayed Chergui and my colleagues and the store clerk were fascinated by it and so I am. The honey and tobacco along with a sweet fruit (does it smell like cherry?) it’s to die for. And it’s not powdery on me so I bought a bottle of this and one of ginger something , can’t remember the name but I loved it. As for MKK while I love it it’s so similar to Kiehls that I don’t buy it :(', 'I had high hopes for this one, but unfortunately on my skin rose dominates… like it literally punches me in the nose as if I’ve stuck my face in to a freshly bloomed rose bush. Then it gets to a rosey honey tobacco blob. It’s an easy autumn/winter wear, but I dislike rose dominant frags and the honey combo irritates me additionally getting closer to headache inducing. I had to double check If I haven’t sprayed by accident La fille de Berlin which again has a prominent rose but darker.', ""Another masterpiece from Serge Lutens. I don't know how perfumers make something smell hot and dry, but that is what I smell here. Casablanca from Swiss Arabian smells hot and dry as well. With Chergui- I smell the hot and dry desert, and the honey tobacco and spices. It is such a lovely spicy scent I can wear it to bed in the winter because it comforts me. I love unisex fragrances and this is absolutely unisex. I smell sweet and spicy honey, that hot air (so odd- the hay maybe?), fresh hay, and a solid helping of musk. This is my fifth Serge Lutens and I love them all, and all are so incredibly different."", ""An intense frag! Very powder-y, and i love that - but its a little bit too intense for me. The tobacco & muskiness is coming through, and there's a little bit of sweetness hidden in there too. It reminds of a hot summer evening, of unexpected encounters and perhaps new friendships."", 'This is my personality in a bottle, This is one of my favorite fragrances of all time. I own so many fragrances and I always love to discover fragrances, but nothing beat this in my heart.  This is a real charismatic scent it’s reminds me of the old Parisian arts. I love my Chergui but sadly you will never be my signature scent because fragrances are memories for me and I want you for the magical lovely ones, to love you more and more... To describe how much I love you, sometimes I feel I don’t want any one to wear or have you because I’m jealous Chergui.', ""This was a love at first sniff for me. I get black tea, rose hip, just a hint of tobacco and some honeyed herbs.  Beautiful complicated scent. I can't believe it took me so long to discover it. Totally unisex, office friendly, any occasion friendly. Purchased a bottle immediately."", ""I'm disappointed with this scent even though I've heard a lot of positive reviews. Not for me"", ""A gorgeous perfume. For the quality it has, the price is excellent. I can't describe specific notes, but the scent is captivating. Good longevity and sillage. For me, it's versatile, but calls for more formal wear. Overall rating 9/10."", ""Complex AF. More than any other perfume I own, this one changes the longer you wear it. The first 45 minutes are raw, funky and masculine with smoke, musky amber and tobacco dominant in a way that I don't dislike, but find hard to be at ease with. Then it settles into a warm, grassy, honeyed floral that is comforting yet still retains an edge to it before becoming powdery. I'm still getting to know Chergui, and haven't figured out if I like it or not. I strongly suspect that the way it challenges me will draw me in over time, and that's a very respectable thing to have accomplished in a fragrance. A month later:  This has become my favorite perfume. The different notes that emerge can fit so many different moods, seasons, and times of day. It's comforting, it's edgy, it plays with gender and style. The scent feels personal and helps me feel grounded when I'm feeling unsure, which is one of the things I love about fragrance. Signature scent? Maybe..."", ""Resinous, powdery like fine, hot sand, sweet like dried cherry soda on the lips, and faintly smokey, Chergui is a decently complex yet very smooth fragrance. Despite the heavy notes I listed, there is a cleanliness to it, it's not dirty or erotic per se. Rather than outright sex, it evokes a more restrained, mysterious sensuality, like someone who looks elegant and clean but feels hot to the touch.  Like others have mentioned, its projection is muted; I've enjoyed it on myself but haven't received compliments on it from friends or strangers. It's perfectly unisex in the sense that it won't smell masculine on a woman or feminine on a man."", 'Chergui opens with a coumarinic hay with honeyish sweetness and light ambery tones. Hay had always struck me as dry, and combined with ambery resin I can see the analogy of a desert wind.  However the honey note only renders an olfactive ""sticky"" texture, and gives the whole thing an impression of sticky, wet ambery hay. It does have moments of beauty, and I can see why it\'s so well liked. It is an art piece. I can imagine it being cozy, warm and comforting. It has very modest projection, so it is very much a personal fragrance.  Just make sure not to believe th youtube parrots and instagram accounts who claim this is a ""tobacco honey"" fragrance.', ""On paper: Hmmm. This is lovely. I'm getting lots of iris, some rose, some hay, some honey, very light and airy tobacco. Some incense to round it off. I don't get powder or smoke. May be later. Sharp Iris made me sneeze. Nice. The blend feels all natural and identifiable. I'm loving this! Totally unisex, fresh, sweet, grounded, exciting, intriguing yet soothing blend. On skin: it turns too sweet for me. Also the soapy sandalwood and rose accord seems out of place. It's a no for me."", ""If you are looking for a sweet, honey, cherry tobacco, this is NOT that...at all. This is very strange. I really don't know what to say other than it was absolutely not what I imagined it would be, having heard about this over the years, and watching so many reviews. There is an accord here that is so overpowering - I'm guessing it's the hay. I definitely get a powdery dried weeds/grass/hay, and a medicinal note along with it. Just NOT what I want to smell like and very removed from the notes. THIS is niche perfumery. There is NOTHING mainstream, universal, or easily likeable about this."", ""I am surprised nobody (well, I have not read all comments) has noticed that when this dries down, it becomes very similar to Dior's Feve Delicieuse. VERY."", ""Shergui is a famous fragrance in perfume history. It's an oriental fragrance and one of the first fragrances that used a tobacco and honey combination. Another interesting note here is hay which gives a rural character to the fragrance. I personaly like the honey accord a lot. Honey is rich, complex, slightly animalic, and not too sweet like the fruity or gourmand accords. The tobacco-honey and tobacco-hay combination is a source of inspiration for many fragrances. The fragrance is sitting on a very soft musk and sandalwood. To me, the fragrance is better for older people. 7.5/10"", 'A woman who doesn’t have to carry her own lighter, men and butch dykes alike flock to duel for the honor to light her cigarette.', 'Not as deep and rich as my decant sadly. Seems the amber and maybe the honey has been toned down. Maybe a touch less Iris too, although it’s still powdery. Hopefully leaving it in my closest for a few months will help.', ""Lutens Chergui is a smooth, powdery, rich, warm honeyed tobacco with an ambery fougere base. If that wasn't praise enough, the note of 'hay' gives this fragrance a level of distinction afforded to few, the scent is completely unique. Dry, herbal, grassy, it truly breathes life into the 'tobacco' accord. This is the only tobacco fragrance I've tested that actually brings to mind the aroma of dried tobacco leaves. Due to the high concentration of naturals in this fragrance, spraying can stain fabric, and the scent is heavier, more dense, a lot less legible. It has some progression to it, but it's not easy for me to relay. The top and heart notes showcase the florals, aromatic touches, and honey, with the base being a dense blend of sweet ambers, warm musks, sandalwood, and tonka.  The fougere DNA might feel more masculine to some, but Chergui reminds me of many mid-century unisex options. Anyone could wear it, but whether you find it more masc/femme will come down to your scent perception and individual skin chemistry. My perception of this scent changes with the humidity and the season."", 'This is an interesting one. Rather sweet and yet dry. Impressive longevity. Retains its opening notes throughout, so totally linear. The silage is just right also: that is to say it will project out beyond your personal space but not in an embarrassing or clumsy way. It is, instead, both refined and elegant. Definitely a fragrance to wear for “going out”, though. I love smelling it on myself throughout the evening but I find that I get rather sick of it upon waking next morning and it’s still going strong. Too much of a good thing, perhaps. Definitely NOT a morning or office scent!', ""I have 4 formulas of Chergui, 2001(green juice), 2011, 2015, 2020(black label). I can clearly see the trend of the reformulation, besides toning down its intensity, Its syrupiness that I like is all the way declining, to the point the 2020 formula almost has no syrupiness, entirely taken over by incense and tobacco, dry and flat.  The difference between the 2011 and 2015 is very much noticeable but it is not as big comparing to the 2020. I mean comparing to formula 2020, even the 2015 formula smells amazing. Let me put it this way, The original formula 2001-2002 green juice is like IMAX 8k Atoms with full impact, the 2011 is like normal cinema experience, the 2015 is like big screen home cinema with surround sound. the 2020 will be like watching the same movie on your phone. Not bad, still the same movie, but very different experience. side note: I can sniff my wrist sprayed Chergui for as long as I want when it's formula 2001/2011/2015. But I can't do this with the formula 2020, it gives me a hint of nausea that makes me stop. I'm not really sure why, my guess is this new formula 2020 contains larger portion of synthetic ingredients than the old formulas."", ""I live at the boarder of Provence. It's 38°C outside, dry as it can be, Mistral is blowing. This is to me the exact purpose of Chergui.  The beauty of the spices, the burning wood and the powdery amber flow from my shirt around in the air, making Chergui alive..."", 'Powder and Spice. I found the notes to be non-reflective of the scent. Chergui is powdery, probably from the iris/musk/hay combo, with minimal iris lipstickiness. There is a moderate touch of spice from the incense and sandalwood, with slight rosiness. The honey and amber add an ambery depth to the scent with some sweetness. Soft, powdery, musky, warm spicy, lightly sweet. It reminds me a lot of Frederic Malle\'s Musc Ravageur. Similar scent profile (musky, warm spicy, lightly sweet). Of note, the honey note here is not very photorealistic like the honey note in, say, Zoologist Bee. That is a good thing here as it suits Chergui\'s overall scent better. A mature, masculine, cool weather wear. ""Like""', 'This is my second review for this perfume. First one was made 7 years ago and since I was not experienced in perfumery as much as I am today I was not able to estimate full bouquet and aspects of this fragrance. 7 years ago I had been finding this scent ordinary amber and even boring. Today I can say that it is beautiful mix of dry hay, medicinal herbs and amber with the touch of sweetness that is not cloying or nauseous. I would describe the sweet accord as liquorish-honey-carrot combo that both gives this scent softness and air. Also this perfume has creamy undertones that makes it comfortable for everyday wear and for all occasions. I guess perfume won’t disturb or irritate people next to its owner cause it feels that projection is closer that arm length (but not close to skin). Hopefully I will find good price for 50ml cause I feel that I need it for my collection 😋', 'Unless you put on a tiny amount, this scent is too heavy for warm weather. I mostly got honey, sandalwood, and tobacco when I wore it. I got ten hours of wear time from just a few sprays. I wound up liking this more than I thought, since tobacco doesn’t always smell good on my skin. I wouldn’t mind trying it again sometime in the future.', 'Has this been reformulated?  My decant has more depth than the bottle I just bought. Love the composition. Can’t agree with the “old house/people”-smell.  It’s a round agreeable smell with just right amount spices without being boring or simple.', ""Man o man I keep coming back to this one. Such a beautiful, sensual powdery tobacco. There's really nothing else like it on the market. Normally I don't like powdery scents, but this is gorgeous. I spray it on before bedtime and sleep like Rip van Winkle. Absolutely love this gem. So soothing....👌"", 'I really don\'t get why this perfume is so loved...I think it smells like the house of an really old couple that smoke inside and don\'t clean that often..you know, that have bonbons fuzzy with dust. It\'s powdery, heavy, spicy, smokey and ""old"". I had a bottle some years ago but gave it away cause I found it to be just awful.', 'Generic rubbish compared to what it was,I feel sorry for the people raving about the reformulated Chergui,they probably haven’t smelt a decent fragrance', ""It smells very luxurious. Like how an Arabian prince's room would smell like, a room with dark wood furniture and maroon velvets. I love it a lot but it's not an everyday scent. It requires a very specific mood. I think it only works for winter, otherwise it'd be too much. Weirdly, it might work in a very dry summer day as well."", 'Powdery enough to set my makeup', 'I got this one so wrong when I first got it. I found it too sweet and powdery. I put it away as a potential swap or sell.  But.  I got it out a few weeks ago and I can’t believe I almost got rid of it. It is so good. Yes it is sweet, yes it is powdery, but it is also so spicy and the tobacco is on another level. This is so cozy, so masculine, so wearable. Perfect for fall and winter. The only problem now is that I feel less confident about getting rid of some of the scents I don’t like, what if they pull a Chergui on me?!  This one is great. Get it.', ""This is a perfume that needs heat to really bloom. In cool weather it is light honey with a very sharp woody note (the balsalmic I assume). It's nice, but it's sort of flat and the notes feel like they are bumping awkwardly against one another. But let the temperature get above 80F and everything changes. Chergui turns into liquid gold. It's like bathing in raw, natural honey in an old tobacco drying shed in the summer. It's deep and rich and sensuous and it sings. It keeps pumping out the glory even while I and my horse are sweating through our workout under the hot sun, we still smell wonderful. Wait until summer, spritz a bit of this on and sink into luxury. I love it. But I suspect this is a love it or loath it sort of fragrance. So be warned, shy and retiring it is not."", ""Unisex, like a lot of fragrances, maybe all fragrances; and it's not a joke. Perhaps some people fear to be not masculine enough... Pathetic when it becomes an obsession. Wear what you want."", 'This is the scent that got me back into perfume after a 2 year hiatus in which I was fragrance free. Ironically I bought this tobacco heavy scent to celebrate quitting smoking. I went to the perfume house in Portland looking for something special and smelled a lot of different scents. They have the Lutens out to play with along with a booklet of notes as determined by the owner who is a certified nose. Not knowing anything about the line I started flipping through the book and sniffing the bottles, spraying them on cotton balls etc. Chergui was listed as hay sugar, tobacco, honey and perhaps 1-2 other notes, no flowers though and I was intrigued but couldn\'t find the bottle. I asked the saleswoman in the store where it was and her eyes twinkled a bit and she grabbed it from the back, almost empty and told me they were out of stock. It ended up being the one fragrance I tested on my wrist, I thanked her and told her I would be back if I liked it and left the store to grab some lunch.  Walking down the street on that sunny fall day is such a clear and wonderful memory. I kept lifting my wrist and breathing in deeply. About 1 1/2 hours later I knew I wanted to have it. I called the shop and the SA instantly knew who I was and told me ""I knew you would be back for this one, it\'s so special and my absolute favorite"". They put me on the waiting list, 1 week later I had the bottle in my hand and was reunited with an old love of perfume. I love this fragrance, smokey, sweet, yum.', 'Chergui comes from Arabic Sharqi, which is the name given, in Morocco, to the wind that blows from the Sahara desert. In Arabic, it means ""from the East"" and, in the case of the perfume, has no connection with the island of the same name, located in Tunisia. Serge Lutens is passionate about Morocco and chose the place as his house. Many of his inspirations come from there. In the case of Chergui, Lutens defines as: ""a fire fanned by the wind; a desert in flames"". The composition brings hay sugar, Iris, rose, honey, incense, tobacco leaves, amber, musk, and sandalwood. For those who don\'t know, there are some types of hay with high sugar content, like the Hay of sugarcane and the Hay of Greece (fenugreek). In the case of the latter, its seeds have an aroma very similar to the aroma of maple syrup (the one used in pancakes). Again, Christopher Sheldrake managed to interpret the ideas of Serge in an exquisite manner. Chergui, the wind, passes over the Atlas Mountains, going down by the coastal plains heading towards the Atlantic Ocean, completely dry. And the result of Chergui, the perfume, is exactly that: a dry and warm blow on the skin that will only become calm once the dust goes down. Once sprayed on my skin, I thought: ""I want a bottle now""! The first impact brings a rose honeydew and an iris that is not powdery as usual, but floral and with nuances of violets. Suddenly, without notice, arises an aroma of honey and a creamy tobacco, warmed by the amber. At this stage, it reminded me a lot of The Dreamer (Versace) and of the reason why this scent is so appreciated, even though being part of a commercial brand. This is a great tobacco! And this was the longest stage of evolution on my skin. From there, about three hours after I applied, Chergui changes again and, as the wind, loses strength and becomes smoother, although dry. The incense and the sandalwood blend and create a nuance that resembles a soft leather. However, I read many comments that show that in addition to evolving a lot, Chergui can also be mutant. The comparisons go from Obsession (Calvin Klein) and Tobacco Vanille (Tom Ford) to Bvlgari Black (Bvlgari) and Eau des Baux (L\'Occitane). For some people proved to be very feminine. On my skin, I found it more masculine. Anyway, this beautiful perfume – launched in 2001 (not in 2005, according to Wikipedia) – manages to be elegant, strong, seductive, and different. It\'s the kind of perfume that people stop you on the streets to ask its name. Just a reminder: Have I already said I want a bottle?', ""My grandfather was a serious smoker, and he lived with us since I was born until he passed away.  His day consisted of long smoking sessions in his room, watching television, going to the park to chat with his friends, and buying fresh bread from bakeries early in the morning. Whenever he left the house to do any of those things, my mother would go and spray deodorant in his room to get rid of the intensely sweet and dark tobacco smell.  I find it very ironic and interesting how this smell is perceived differently in cultures. In mine this is the smell of a chain smoking old man that should not spread to the rest of the house, in other's this is something that people would choose to smell like during the day and hail it as their favorite perfume."", 'I\'m a consistent and relentless blind buyer and I don\'t apologize for it. Perhaps it\'s a vice, and maybe I need an intervention, but it\'s a joy to do and I\'ll continue doing it with a lot of researching and review-reading preceding the blind buying. I blind bought Chergui out of sheer hype and here I am, underwhelmed and disappointed. I don\'t hate Chergui, but I\'m far from being enthralled or filled to the brim with anticipation to wear it. I\'ve worn it four times now, and on different types of days. First, I wore it on a fall evening. The second time, on a warm fall day. The third time, on a rainy afternoon. The fourth time, when it was freezing cold outside. On my skin, Chergui is undoubtedly subtle. I bet I could spray up to 15 times and it still wouldn\'t be cloying, but rest assured for my own sake as well as the consideration of others, I won\'t be doing that. The longevity goes from alright to pretty good on me. I\'ve read reviews mentioning the hay in the fragrance, and how the fragrance overall is rich and complex. I don\'t get any hay nor do I perceive any richness and complexity in Chergui. Due to its subtle qualities, I find it light and soft, and that\'s perfectly fine, and as far as the complexities, I see none, as the scent -- to my nose -- is straight up damp tobacco and light honey. The honey is like somebody who is shy, looking down and nervously saying ""Hi"" while the tobacco is like the rugged guy in the corner of the room, keeping to himself but making his appearance known and recognized. If I could go back in time, I wouldn\'t have bought a bottle of Chergui. There\'s no ""wow"" factor here, like so many people have commented on. It\'s just a bottle that\'s there, on my shelf. I don\'t know when to wear it. Romantically? Maybe, but of the girls whose opinions I\'ve asked, none were blown away. At a formal event? Yeah, it\'s wear-worthy, but I have many other fragrances in my collection that I\'d rather wear to such an event. Casually? Never. I am not going to sell or swap my bottle of Chergui, however. I\'m going to continue to revisit this scent every now and again, because everyone\'s nose progresses, matures and develops. Who knows, I might come back to it in five years and fall in love with it, but right now, it\'s just \'there\' on my shelf without serving a purpose to me. I never reach for it. Also, for what it\'s worth, I don\'t believe in the whole ""fragrances expire!"" schtick. If you properly store a bottle, it will last for longer than you can imagine. I have two vintage bottles of Dior\'s Fahrenheit (they were my late father\'s that he purchased/received as gifts in 1989 and 1993) and both smell terrific even to this day in 2014. Imagine that.', ""I have a deep respect for Chergui--it's unique and masterfully blended.  I do not like it. There is something sweet and synthetic in the heart of this scent that instantly reminds me of my narcissistic mother. Plastic plants collecting dust. Cheap potpourri. The Soji Tabuchi powder room at night. Cleaning solution unsuccessfully attempting to cover the smell of sh*t in a doctor's office bathroom. A manufactured pleasantry thinly veiling deep, unspoken resentment. A lonely childhood. Sigh, time to swap this out for something a little more comforting and hopeful..."", 'With my chemistry this smells like a grownup baby powder. A sandalwood, tobacco, floral, incense based baby powder that is overall, actually very sweet. Really bizarre mix.', ""Just not for me. I am left out , again. Opening was a nose curling , sickly sweet, spiced rotten rose, so extreme and intense this fragrance still scares me. Lots of powder too, rose powder. Sadly, yet again I get all the good stuff- beautiful, sensual honeyed tobacco way too late in the scents life. 3 hours of pain and wait?? And the rose never quite dissipates. The old-fashioned, wild monstrous rose, not the Le labo 31 Rose. I just cannot understand how a fragrance with these notes manages to produce an actual scent like that in the opening. It's too wild and overbearing. Also, the rose and powder are overly feminine but even then the rose has a bitter edge one can associate with those very outdated scents; why put it in here with already very intense and heavy notes? It's just really poor scent design to add such an awful powdery rose oil in the opening. Why create a potential Masterpiece and ruin it with an awful challenging aspect like that, it makes little sense. When you're paying £60+ for 50ml, you need it to be good from 0 seconds after you apply, not 6 hours. My rating: 4/10.  Sorry. Try Diptyique's Volutes. Now, that is a scent.""]"

I have always loved it and still do. but as my perfume collection grew into 280, some perfumes got lost a bit. the last days I experienced the same phenomenon I once had with Creeds Irisia and Jean Desprez Bal á Versailles. something got stuck in the nozzle. so out came a foul and what seemed, a 'turned' smell of perfume ingredients gone bad. now the Irisia nor Bal á Versailles stayed bad, and apparently Datura Noir goes the same good way. the Intrusive Hubrid, Putrid and Down To Earth 'Stench' metamorfosed by doggedly keeping spraying. then the 'Trombosis' gets loose and step by step the original perfume gets released. but these Initial Foul Spritzes facilitated the process as such, that the Veritable Character of this perfume eversomuch exposed itself almuch as Richly, Heavily Drapedly and Hysterically Dramatically. these are the Indoles, Scatoles and other Aroma Chemical Fleetingnesses which are liberated. it may not ALL be anyone's cup of tea but it is mine. I was thinking about the Datura, the Devil's Trumpet, from the Night Shade family. I fantasized it must have been Solanaceae derivatives 'dried up' in vitro. but no, now I realise the Datura must be a Fleur Muette, a Numb Flower which doesn't release her secrets so easily. so it must be recreated (deconstructed we could also say) with the help of other White Flowers. Tubereuse, Osmanthus, Heliotrope, Lemon Blossom, Vanilla. then I think the Myrrh, Almond, Musk and Tonka did a great job to hostage the nozzle of the flacon. it almost seemed like civet. and now I have the original perfume back where it even is better, more ripe, more insouciant and languourously intoxicative."", ""Gosh this is gorgeous. I want to roll around in it, drink it, make a love potion with it. It has a certain texture to it, almost seamless, but I think maybe its the myrrh that breaks it up and adds a welcome respite from something that could otherwise be almost too creamy. This is not tuberose prominent as you might think. In fact that's the backdrop, tucked neatly behind a pretty smooth blend of almond, coconut, vanilla. Tonka woven throughout, I think it may be the backbone here. If the tuberose is the canvas to this painting, the Tonka is the frame. Its unusually fresh for such a blend, and while its sweet it treads that fine line beautifully. Its very big on initial spray, but it softens fairly quickly (unless Im just going nose blind lol). The longevity on this is moderate. It's reminds me a bit of Poudre D'Or but a bit bigger with a longer life span, and more coconut and almond. Not super natural but very easy to love. Fairly feminine, most seasons except maybe winter- and still doable then. Not a gourmand though it leans that way. Not a freshie but it leans that way too. Does it smell a bit like suntan lotion? Why yes it does. Do I adore it anyway? Absolutely."", 'Perfume is perception based on olfactory experiences. Some people ""hear"" this scent in loud decibels. For me, Datura Noir is liquidy cozy tuberose that flows around you like dry ice smoke. It is simple, yet comforting. At least for me.', ""A long-time favorite. I've loved this since it first came out. To me it smells like summer, lounging on the beach and splashing around with friends and loved ones. Reminds me of a popular shampoo back in the early 90s that I'm still trying to figure out the name of. The coconut is subtle, but really adds something. Even if you despise coconut notes, this will probably be safe for you as it's not the focus and so well-blended that you don't notice that's what it is unless you're looking for it. So lovely. Very wearable and approachable scent. I do understand the sentiment that it's not datura-heavy. It's not overtly floral, for sure so if that's your goal, you can look elsewhere and pass this by. That said, I think it's pretty divine and don't quite understand the Keiko Mecheri comparisons and her creations have always been painfully synthetic to my nose and borderline offensive - especially the formulations within the last 20 or so years.  Less likely to offend those around you or cause an allergic reaction, (but personally I never advise SL for work or hospital-like settings due to the number of aromachemicals present). That said, this is fairly gentle that way and I always appreciate SL's gentle touch that way. Very few of SL creations seem to hit like a hammer that way and I have some fairly severe perfume allergies that do actually cause me to go into anaphylaxis! (Yes, I do appreciate the irony. . . 😂)"", 'Datura Noir is mindblowingly vulgar. I’m not sure if it’s good vulgar or bad vulgar. It’s made with high-quality ingredients, for sure, but it’s an extremely powerful tuberose-coconut blend, which is kind of like “cream on cream” and “sweet on sweet”. Where Carnal Flower is a gauzy white tuberose with just a hint of golden coconut, Datura Noir is full-on sunscreen-lotion SEXY! BEACH! TIME!  The intoxicating sweetness is so potent that I’m genuinely not sure whether it smells delicious or annoying. It’s the first perfume I’ve worn where I’ll be minding my business, focusing on other things, and I’ll actively be distracted by the smell wafting up from my wrists. It’s brazen. It’s the perfume equivalent of spray tans and boob jobs.  It’s…actually kind of pretty, though, and it does have some complexity. The opening has some of the green, fresh aspect of tuberose – at first I wondered it was gardenia, before the full swoony sweetness unfolded. Later on, I got a whiff of bitter almond, and also some kind of dried-palm-frond-underbrush-like smell that I remember from Hawaii, that place high up on the beach that’s shaded by scrubby tropical trees where you might hang your hammock. And it’s a really nice blend of creamy coconut milk and golden-sweet apricot syrup – if you want a fragrance that’s both fruity and creamy without being too silly and literal in the “dessert” direction, this is a good example.  For me, it’s really on the edge between “I’d find this fun to wear again as a pick-me-up” and “maybe this will be too annoying to the people around me.” And I don’t really have a SEXY! BEACH! TIME! lifestyle. But if I ever get invited to someone’s private island, I’ll consider picking up a sample.', ""Harsh opening scent. dies down a bit and disappears. maybe its my skin but sure isn't worth the price"", 'Gorgeous. Very feminine. Narcotic. It does have a narcotic floral scent yet it is constructed out of different ingredients. It is predominantly almond-coconut on a tuberose canvas. I feel also musk and tonka beans, lemon blossom and apricot. Maybe a drop of heliotrope and vanilla. It is a gentle cloud. Nothing harsh, nothing too obvious. Just beautiful.  It feels universal weather-wise, day and night. A perfect signature. It is one of the prettiest Lutens scents yet far from generic. A classic beauty with wide appeal. If you want something special and to try niche this is a perfect choice.', 'A floral with an unexpected lightness, like moonlight filtering through a gauzy fabric woven from daylight. The tuberose here isn’t its usual heavy, intoxicating self. Rather, it floats, airy and almost weightless, softened by a veil of coconut that adds a dreamy, creamy texture without tipping into sunscreen territory. A touch of citrus flickers at the edges, but it’s more the bitter zest of the rind than the brightness of fresh juice, lending a subtle tartness that keeps the composition from becoming too languid.  As it settles, a warm, vanillic powderiness unfurls, wrapping the florals in a soft, glowing haze. Evokes, weirdly yet appealingly, a lightly perfume-spritzed, crumbly almond shortbread cookie. It’s equal parts delicately sweet and gently mysterious, like a fleeting whisper of white floral lingering in creamy morning mist, refusing to be pinned down. Irresistible.', 'I do get a lot of almond with flowers. It’s also soapy. Sniffing up close, I get a bit of bitterness; so I like to smell this from a distance.  This is my second Serge Lutens. I prefer Fils de Joie, which is gorgeous.', 'I want to love this so much but there is a squeaky shampoo note under the delicious coconut Tuberose that stays throughout the entire fragrance. I have a vintage 50ml that I paid a fair bit for. I think I should sell it. I also have Keiko Mecheri Datura Blanche which I prefer because it’s missing the note I don’t like but very close to this.', 'My experience of this fragrance was the opposite of what I expected, having read just the name. It doesn’t really smell of datura, nor is it “poisonous” in any way as datura is, even if that just means seductive, heavy, penetrating, occlusive, the kinds of qualities that get attributed to femme fatale fragrances. There’s tuberose in this, which can be all of those things, but this is a neutered tuberose. A friendly, light, sedate and easy to wear tuberose. As to Noir, no it’s more like Blanche. White thick coconut, blanched almonds, a solar fragrance of the classiest possible iteration. Instead of being dark and poisonous this is light, bright, pretty, innocent and easy to wear. It lasts 7-8 hours on skin and as it ages the whiteness takes on a purple tinge from heliotrope, which starts to edge out the tuberose. This is by far my favorite stage of this perfume.', ""Lutens fans and collectors, monitor fragrancenet . com!!! Sometimes they put up older bottles for sale (and you can easily recognize them by the images, which are accurate) with their usual cheap prices. I managed to snatch 2009 bottle for barely $50! Where did they even get this older beauty from? It's 15 years old, where has it been all this time?! I am beyond happy with this lucky find. Absolutely gorgeous chunky fleshy tuberose in coconut cream cloud. Oh, it is so, so good. I would need to wear it more to write a detailed review, but right now I am almost ashamed and feel like I committed a crime by buying it so dirt cheap. It is fighting for the spot of being my favorite tuberose fragrance after Tubereuse Criminelle (and Datura is much more wearable and suitable for daily use). For the first hour it is actually very strong and projecting. Then it quiets down, but not to the level of being a skin scent. Overall longevity on me is about 4 hours, which I consider quite good."", ""This fragrance is so comforting to me. 3 sprays on my chest and I'm getting wafts of creamy solar tuberose and slightly poisonous almond smell. A bit powdery and cool- the coconut comes out more in spring weather for me, and it's a coconut meat texture. Like Hypnotic Poison, Datura Noir has a slightly doughy vibe, but think of pastry dough coated in almond flour. Serge Lutens does gourmands in such interesting ways! I have the bottle with the old white label, and it has more floral touches and less coconut than the black label version. The older version gives me moderate projection and 8+ hours of longevity. I'm going to need a backup bottle 🤍🤍"", 'Tuberose pillowed in creamy coconut marzipan. A twinge of bitter almond, a nod to the deadly nightshade. The vanilla here is gentle and powdery, really pleasant like the softness of a petal.', ""Generic Perfumes has a dupe for this that is a beautiful, well-blended oil - at last: a tropical tuberose that doesn't blast you out of your seat. If you can't get to Paris to shell out for the original, this might fill the creamy vanillic indolic hole in your heart"", ""edit: wore this to bed, and was pretty turned off by how powdery it is. it reminds me of baby wipes too much to be sexy.  I was really hoping for something that would replicate the experience of sticking my nose directly into an angel's trumpet dangling invitingly onto the sidewalk from some neighbor's yard in san francisco, without risking being caught on their ring camera. this doesn't smell like that, and doesn't smell like datura either, from what i gather. it's the first serge luten i've smelled, which i regret a bit because it seems like it's not typical of his style. it's very pleasant. it reminds me of alien, but is sweeter and rounder and significantly less abrasive (i like alien). it doesn't remind me of angel but it smells like something an angel would wear. it's thick but i don't think it'd be oppressive in heat."", ""It started with a very distinct lemon cleaning product scent, but i was glad it went away within 5 minutes. It then turns into a soapy, floral but sweet smell. It's somewhat creamy (probably the coconut which I can smell clearly) and I'm surprised there's no black liquorice at all it in, since I can smell it (or something very similar).  To me it smells classy, light and feminine. I think it works best in warmer weather, since it's not heavy and it smells a bit like soap (that light, clean scent)."", ""It's not discontinued- it's still available on the Serge Lutens website in the Bell Jar.

Great reviews? Quite a few recommendations to try this as a good-yet-sophisticated coconut scent? I was so on board for trying this one, and hunted it all over Switzerland, only to find it in an apothecary in a Montreux side street (not even big department stores like Globus had it since it has been relegated to an exclusive line, only available in France). And then...  Pleasant scent, no coconut.  Or all that much almond.  I don\'t remember white flowers either. 😐 Not *bad* necessarily, just doesn\'t do what it says on the tin.', 'Lovely beachy white floral. Less vanillic and more floral than Replica\'s Beach Walk. This is creamy and sweet, but not overly so. I think it\'s the smoothest and prettiest I\'ve tried out of all the lotion-y seaside-y white florals. Not really sure why the word ""noir"" is in the name, since this fragrance is the antithesis of darkness. I was suprised to see so many interesting notes here. To me DN is rather straightforward lily, vanilla, and musk. Regardless of Datura Noir\'s familiar (some might say redundant) profile, I really do enjoy it and swoon each time I sniff my wrist.', ""creamy tuberose with a fresh citrus undercurrent; enveloping and soft, like a minky scent blanket. it reminds me a little of moon carnival from vilhelm parfumerie; the big tuberose opening creates a similar feeling. good, though not terribly unexpected, so perhaps a little underwhelming for my first experience with serge lutens, but the name drew me in.  i suppose i can imagine it as an adequate scent for the angelic-looking white datura trumpets, but it's missing a hint of foreboding, the 'noir' part of its name, to convincingly pass off as something poisonous. the almond note tries, but it isn't bitter enough and instead adds to the balmy, rounded feeling of the scent. i don't get too much coconut - it's there, but not dominating the foreground, which is a good thing for me. i went on a nice short hike several hours after applying and the sweat brought out a sweeter vanillic profile in the base notes. very wearable. those who say it reminds them of sunscreen are not entirely wrong."", ""Delicious creamy coconut. Heavy white floral opening, tuberose dominates for the first few minutes, but it quickly fades into the background and gives way to the majestic coconut. Delicious scent, and even though there are strong notes of things that are edible, it doesn't feel gourmand. To me it's a soft and cosy fragrance. Light and creamy. Reminds me of body lotions, but that's because I love coconut and I tend to buy stuff with coconut on the packaging."", 'Smells lovely but it gave my boyfriend hives', 'All I smell is quite sharp white flowers and very indolic jasmine with veryyy faint traces of coconut, no almonds whatsoever. After few hours, it turns into creamier lightly sweet floral scent.', 'the sample smelled different then the actual perfume for me,the sample had more coconut to it and it was very creamy, it gave me a coconut lotion , beach vibe and i loved it. but when i got the full bottle all i smelled for the most was WHITE FLOWERS. I wish it smelled like the sample more.', 'I love it. A super pretty and floral white tuberose with notes of almonds, cream, and maybe light coconut. I do enjoy it a lot, it\'s really a masterpiece. It\'s a permanent bottle in my collection. Narcotic V is slightly sexier, but this fragrance is just plain elegant compared to the Nasomatto\'s. It\'s more similar to Diptyque\'s Do Son in my opinion. Also, it\'s not as ""dark"" or ""green"" as the Jo Malone\'s tuberose angelica.', 'Powdery creamy tuberose, coconut and vanilla. I get the almond, too. It has been sold out on the official online store for a long time, and returned recently. But sold out again a few days later!', 'Heavy vintage style floral gourmand musk that will appeal to lovers of sweet syrupy fragrances. The scent opens with gourmand notes of orange, almond, coconut and slight apricot. The dense floral heart has tuberose, heliotrope, osmanthus and lemon. The perfume settles on a sweet powdery base of synthetic musk, tonka bean, vanilla and slight myrrh. The slyly named scent suggests an intoxicating poisonous plant like datura, which the scent does not contain. The feminine leaning scent has moderate to strong sillage and good longevity. Enjoy!', 'Lovely creamy floral fragrance from the coconut, vanilla and white flowers, apparently it has been discontinued so stock up on your bottles now!', 'In hot weather the fruitier notes appear more where as in cold weather the tuberose is too heavy for me. Don’t mistake me, it’s not fruity but it lightens up that tuberose. When ever I wear this and it’s not super hot I don’t enjoy wearing it. Personally I like to wear it in the dog days of summer or at the end of summer when it’s hot during the day and starting to cool off at night (I live in the southern states).  Edit. At one point I was obsessed with this fragrance but ended up decluttering because it was too tuberose heavy.', 'Tropical, dense, creamy white floral and coconut lotion, i get barely a hint of almond. The neutrogena body oil comes to mind when I spray this.', ""Firstly, 'Datura' is a bit of a misnomer in this case as the scent Serge Lutens and Christopher Sheldrake attempted to recreate is that of Brugmansia or 'Angel's Trumpet', which supposedly smells heady, sweet and of orange and marzipan, depending on the variety. Datura Noir opens with an intensive, bittersweet and almost poisonous almond liqueur/marzipan accord paired with lactonic, heady and apricot-inflected tropical white flowers that possess an almost 'meaty' carnality. This is a heavenly creamy, almost lotion or hair conditioner-like almond & heliotrope floral that has perfected the 'playdough' accord/subgenre popularized by Hypnotic Poison. If Hypnotic Poison is $2 Play-Doh you'd find at any dollar store, Datura Noir is handcrafted artisanal playdough purchased for the children of Hamptons hedge fund millionaires. I think its associations with summer and to a lesser extent exoticism can be largely attributed to marketing and the power of suggestion. While I agree that this is tropical, heady and bewitching, I'd argue it's better suited to autumn or early spring (it needs a little warmth to bloom) as it is predominantly an intensely dense, lactonic, buttery & nutty pastry scent in the same realm as the aforementioned Hypnotic Poison or Armani Code Cashmere yet undeniably more polarizing. Would you categorize them as summer fragrances? Doubtful. Oh, and this really does smell like Herbal Essences Hello Hydration shampoo & conditioner in the blue bottles."", ""Almond-heavy tuberose. If you're having trouble with the white floral, try spraying it upwards and letting the mist land on your arm like rain. I do agree that it smells like an expensive body lotion with it's hint of vanilla and that dried-sunscreen smell."", 'This is a lovely scent. I thoroughly enjoyed this today. I get the similarities to Terracotta, but I find Datura Noir to have more vanilla & less coconut + the addition of almond. It worked well on a sunny spring day and I would imagine it’d work well in summer. Although in summer I’d probably reach for Terracotta because there’s a crisp element to DN; I find Terracotta to be much warmer.  9/10', 'This is a different white floral than most of us are used to. I get the coconut but this is not your usual coconut that you you get from a beachy scent, this is way more sophisticated and refined. I get every single note listed at different moments of this fragrance, almond tuberose osmanthus and vanilla. I don’t see it listed but I get Frangipani also. It comes off more like yellow florals later on in the drydown. This is a great vacay scent but not the usual. At first spray it strong and heady then mellows. The Heliotrope come forward. I’ve always been a Serge Lutens fan since 20 years ago maybe even longer Serge was my first niche purchase. Sillage is excellent and longevity is definitely something to write home about it’s a long one 8 + for sure. Highly recommended for summer and late spring….something to bring along on a cruise or heading to the Caribbean any beach vacation for sure. Recommended 9/10 maybe screechy or headache inducing if oversprayed.', 'Slight mothball opening. Thankfully that goes away and like most reviewers have said, dried down to a face cream/fancy suntan lotion scent. I also get lots of tuberose. Quite nice, i can see using it for bedtime or laying on the beach on a relaxing vacay. Update2: Ughh I cant get over the moth ball/urinal cake scent in this fragrance! Decluttered!', 'I get a faint association to Hypnotic Poison edt whenever I smell Datura Noir. Perhaps it’s the almond and the way it plays into the composition. This is Very much a lotion/luxury body cream scent. Not anything like suntan oil or suntan lotion though, it’s more refined than that. It’s Very milky, nutty, warm, and smooth, with no sharp edges whatsoever. It’s very soft and is unfortunately a thin, fleeting whisper of scent however, so don’t expect Un Bois Vanille-level performance with this one. This does not perform well on me. Not even in the warm months. If the performance were better and if it projected just a bit stronger I would definitely keep it. Alas, this is going to be sold.  Very beachy and tropical and quite unique. Not gourmand but still a bit lactonic and organically sweet and natural-smelling. It’s not often that I smell almond in a summer fragrance. The notes are right up my alley, and this is one of the best tuberose scents I have found, but I can barely smell it on myself after 2-3 hours, even after overspraying. Slightly plasticky ( from the musk probably) but the warm creamy florals and coconut balance out the plastic overtone quite well. Still a hard pass due to performance issues.', 'does anybody kno here i can buy this? just tried a decant for the first time and i cant get over it.', ""General white florals, tuberose comes through specifically, then lots of vinyl! Which lends dark and plasticky notes. It develops into sweet soap like my grandma's bathroom, with a hint of almonds underneath. It's a lovely, cool yet unique white floral, but it sits so close to the skin it wouldn't be worth my time to wear it."", ""So this is immediate impressions! Vanilla is stronger at the start and present throughout, with a nutty sweetness, as it starts drying down, combined with the clean white musk, the lotion-y feel really comes through. I think I even get a slightly smokey/incense-like profile? And a very quite amber that I may or may not even pick up on if I wasn't told about it. Certainly white floral, but is not really so evident for me that it is tuberose. Or at least not that similar to conventional tuberose dominant stuff, I would say! Certainly not that sweet though, and not that powdery either! And I very much agree with someone below that it smells more like a balm or a cream rather than spray, or kind of like you've done both. I would imagine if you went really overboard with this, it might even smell a bit like you've drowned yourself in body lotion. Later edit: Past the drydown, you probably couldn't smell this from more than a couple inches away, I mean, I can JUST smell it on my own ears and chest. Lasts perfectly well however."", 'This is a sweet tuberose with coconut, but its also --- MARZIPAN, and strongly so.  Must like that powdery almond, vanilla, marzipan, because that is what rivals for dominance over the sweet tuberose in this perfume.  The dry down is all heliotrope almond vanilla. While I do like this, I never wear or gravitate towards. (I don\'t really smell the ""recreation"" of Datura (Devil\'s Trumpet) which grows naturally where I live)', 'Pretty, creamy tuberose dominant scent (with a slight suntan lotion/beach vibe). In the same vein as Guerlain Terra-cotta and Chanel Gabrielle.', ""Datura Noir is not what I expected. I was prepared for a run-of-the-mill vanilla-sweetened white floral, despite Serge Lutens' reputation for artistry. Instead, it is a very well-blended, complex scent that is unusual but wearable. Using a poisonous plant as a focal point is always intriguing in perfumery (a marketing ploy aimed at our morbid curiosity, perhaps!), regardless of whether datura is in fact included here at all. Most likely, tuberose is playing the part of datura - not a bad casting choice if you think about it. Essentially, DN is an unusual tuberose-led scent, bolstered by tropical coconut and hazy almond - a clash of seasons in my book, but surprisingly cohesive. DN opens with tropical, lactonic coconut, bolstered by fruity notes. Apricot and orange are most evident, paving the way to osmanthus, adding a lovely peachy floral edge. Tuberose follows closely, creamy and sweet rather than cloying or waxy, with a subtle banana-like undertone. As it develops, warm, hazy almond creeps in, more heliotrope than marzipan. Tonka bean complements it to perfection, while smooth vanilla adds sweetness in the later stages. The florals remain throughout. It becomes increasingly balsamic as it dries down, eventually fading to become a musky, slightly animalic skin scent. The musky-amber here provides a nice counterpoint to the hazy sweetness. Sillage and longevity are moderate. A feminine-leaning day scent, it is a year-round subtle, everyday perfume that features an unusual combination of notes. It is an unusual tropical floral scent, a little too lactonic for my liking, but cleverly composed. Wearable art. 4/5."", 'I really like this. It’s sweet and creamy with a tinge of coconut. Felt like very fancy lotion.', ""Took me a long time to figure this one out. I think this is a big plus in a way, it means it's not one-dimensional. Initially, I thought it was a vanilla-amber combo, which Lutens does so well (if you think about it Amber Sultan is at its heart an amber-vanilla combo). But, this one is so much more. It starts off floral (beautiful, quality, hard to pinpoint florals, which I guess try to evoke the elusive datura note), yet after 15 minutes or so it shifts into another level and there is a change in texture. It becomes this balm-like thing, as if you didn't just spray something but instead applied it as a body cream. This is the aspect I find most fascinating, and in fact therapeutic. Reminds me of how the chamomile note in Aromatics Elixir had a calming effect. Have not come across many perfumes like this; most others feel like they're in a screaming contest. This one somehow centres me."", 'A hypnotically beautiful woman who wears all white and loves coconut water, her delicate footsteps reverberate inside your mind forever enraptured by the memory of the most delicate white petal showers.', 'Had to try this after falling in love with vanilla florals - Keiko Mecheri’s Datura Blanche and Isles Lontaines.  I’m more of a white floral lover but I do get this perfume . It’s a slight coconut( indistinct on me) no coconut sunscreen vibes , there is buttery vanilla and heavenly almonds .  On first spray it was such a gorgeous white floral blast that lasted way too short . Tuberose to me is a strong note so I actually thought it was more a gardenia/ lemon blossom. Then the Osmanthus took centre stage until dry down . The florals became quiet in the background duplicating the datura scent . I wish they were more prominent.  I had Keiko Mecheri’s Fleur d’Osmanthus and I see the resemblance with the Osmanthus / vanilla notes but I had to get rid of the bottle . Not sure if the bottle was off , but I got an unusual rotting stems scent for 3/4 of the scent’s journey nothing like SL Datura Noir which is a softer , creamer scent and much more agreeable to the nose . Not brazen or cloying , it’s very light on my skin .  But I do say. This is pretty linear despite a few reviewers comments . It stays a sweet vanilla , Osmanthus scent from opening notes . I get the almond notes after the floral opening notes and the undertones of a slight musk but I don’t get any fruity notes from the apricot or the mandarin ( though I believe this creates the sweetness with the vanilla ) and no powdery notes ( happy about that ) just creaminess with the vanilla . I own KM Datura Blanche and originally preferred Datura Blanche over Datura Noir because of the predominant Myrrh/ Tonka Bean combination ( more of a special occasion/ evening scent ) . This combination is also evident in DN but is more subdued . It lingers in 2/3 of the scent’s journey creating a slight spice to the Osmanthus .  Regardless , I decided to purchase a bottle of Datura Noir because I find this is more wearable. A day time / non offensive office scent .  There is a place for both in my collection . Also finding out that DN could possibly be discontinued , made me desire this elusive fragrance even more. Very hard to get in Australia .  As for the similarities with KM Isles Lontaines, this is my signature scent and is very different to Datura Noir. It hits all the right happy spots with me with the florals, almond and vanilla notes. No spicy notes .  I would of thought a better name for this fragrance would be “Osmanthus Blanche” as Dakura notes are not included though maybe replicated from the Tuberose and Osmanthus notes. This is a soft creamy scent so I don’t see any correlation to “Noir”.  Overall a very unique scent , worthy of a bottle .', 'This is so incredibly smooth! I just love the blend of the tuberose with the almond. This is a quiet tuberose and I feel like it has elements from other white flowers. I get hints of lily and gardenia. The star of the show is the almond, heliotrope, and tuberose. This manages to smell sweet and creamy, yet has an element of freshness. I think this fragrance could be enjoyed year round. I’m especially looking forward to wearing this on a very crisp cold day. There is something beautiful about white florals cutting through the cold air.', 'I’ve sampled this in the past but wanted to try it out again now that I’ve moved to a warmer climate. Interestingly, this is a lot powderier/more almond and heliotrope than I remembered. Both samples were from decants so I wonder if this is a different formulation to the one I tried before. I’m not getting much of the tuberose and while it’s creamy it’s more powdery than creamy. My favorite in this category of soft tuberose is still Lys 41.', 'This fragrance is luxurious! It is sensual and sexy but also creamy with some slight powderiness. I can smell vanilla, almond, tuberose, heliotrope, musk, coconut and myrrh. My God this fragrance is so smooth, deep, and creamy. I literally can not get enough nor can I stop smelling myself. On me it lasts a good 6-7 hrs and days on clothes. This can easily be worn year round. The coconut in it means you can wear it during summer months.....the almond vanilla and musk make it wearable in winter. To me is smells like a very sexy and confident lady who is very mysterious.', 'At first I thought OOO this smells like a sophisticated version of sunscreen. I could picture someone that is very wealthy who loves the smell of sunscreen wearing this. However, the middle and the dry down is making me sick. You can smell nothing but sickly tuberose that is a little too overwhelming. This is a tuberose fragrance that is not done right. The coconut and the almond try to make the tuberose more creamy. However, it leaves the fragrance to be a little more or a bitter almost sickly tuberose. I love the concept of smelling like a deadly flower though. That is a very interesting concept.', ""Surprisingly similar to Mauboussin Histoire D'une femme sensuelle. Lotion-like and creamy.

It's very interesting as it's not truly a gourmand, nor it is a stereotypical beachy/tropical scent, nor a heavy tuberose or synthetic, cloying coconut. It smells a bit sticky, hypnotic and very inviting. I can sense tuberose, coconut, almonds and heliotrope in similar amounts. There is a noticeable trace of osmanthus too. It's very difficult to describe this perfume, I haven't smelled anything similar.

Other but is that unfortunately this doesn\'t last worth a damn like almost everything I try lately. So IMHO it\'s not worth the price I\'d have to pay for a FB. It\'s too soft for me. So I guess I\'d say that the longevity wasn\'t terrible but it\'s more of a skin scent and I like my perfumes to smack me (and others - they\'ll get over it n hey, they\'ll remember me, hehe ) in the face LOL.

A balmy summer evening in Spain + dinner date with beloved + Datura Noir = a perfection!"", ""Why is datura not even mentioned among the notes? Please don't tell me it's been reformulated. I wore this long ago and I loved it so much."", 'Datura is a poisonous plant belonging to the nightshade family. The unassuming, fragrant, trumpet-shaped flowers hide this plant’s deadly nature.  Datura Noir is a thoughtful, artistic interpretation of this toxic plant. It feigns innocence. Frankly, it doesn’t smell very “noir” at all.. The heliotrope, tuberose, and almond are most prominent in the beginning. But woven between these notes are subtle coconut, tonka, and understated vanilla. The Chinese osmanthus could go underappreciated, but it gives the composition a dignified oriental floral vibe. The scent is long lasting, with moderate sillage. Its evolution is quite linear, though the composition is complex and elegant.  Some fragrances paint vivid pictures in my mind. To me, Datura Noir is a young woman in a far-eastern historical setting. While lovely, she downplays her beauty to go effortlessly unnoticed. Her demure confidence and ability to never offend or appear out of place are the tools she uses to carry out her objective. As she passes the tea tray of the enemy whose house she’s infiltrated, no one sees the poison she drops into his drink before she strolls away. Her target won’t survive the day– just as she intended. Like the flower she’s named after, her pleasant, unassuming traits are also her most deadly assets. The “noir” refers to her intentions and secret power. Overall, this is a fine fragrance. Is it bold and/or mind-blowing? No. But it isn’t supposed to be; that isn’t the point.', 'Serge Lutens Datura Noir, as far as noir-anything goes, is not noir at all. This is a milk glass fairy spell, cast in the delicate light of dawn, calling for pale blossoms soaked in milk at midnight. Heady aromas of honeysuckle and heliotrope combine with buttery floral vanilla fantasies, a flittering whimsy of bitter almond dream fuel, and a diaphanous reverie of powdery coconut musk. This datura-inspired fragrance is less deadly devil’s flower-induced euphoric hallucinations and more moonflower pudding for sleepy Thumbelinas.', ""Review for the black labelled bottle. Veeeeeeeeeery similar to Michael Kors' Wonderlust, which I was slightly disappointed by. Don't get me wrong, I actually quite like Wonderlust for a mainstream perfume, but I was hoping for more from this and have ended up feeling like I can just get the same experience from a much cheaper perfume. This does have a slightly more soapy quality than Wonderlust, and it does last longer on my skin (around 8h as opposed to Wonderlust's 4-6h), but overall it's pretty hard to tell them apart even when I wore one on each wrist as a test."", 'Very very sweet, I\'d say excessively sweet for my taste (and my signature is Vanille Absolu!?). A lot more dominant on the tuberose than anything else, to me the tuberose makes everything else in this perfume close to non-existent. Someone more used to heavy white florals might appreciate the other notes but I\'m just not there yet. i can tell it\'s a well done and well put together fragrance though, something about is quite addictive! Whenever I smell this, my main thought is, ""this is like drugs but for bees, if I was a bee I would want to bathe in this smell"". Keeping it in my collection for now, as I might grow into it with time (which is an extremely rare occurence for me and perfumes but a girl can hope am I right? Edit: Ended up swapping this for something I will probably enjoy more.', ""I'd never say these coconut and almond notes would create something I adore this much. I got this during my big search of perfect tuberose fragrance and this might not have a very prominent tuberose, but the composition is just dreamy. Absolutely comforting, crunchy and adorable. The almonds are sweet and slightly roasted, the impression (not necessarily the smell) reminds me of rafaello sweets. The vanilla makes me consider this almost a gourmand. It is nostalgic, but not dated. It makes me feel older and calmer, more sophisticated. I just wish it lasted a bit more, I feel like it fades after few short hours. I also like to spray this before going to bed. ♥"", 'Got this in my fragrancenet box today. Splurged abit on a full bottle because yt reccomendations . still looking for a sweet heady but also bright fruity bubblegum tuberose ; however this comes close to scratching that itch  This is petit fracas + terracotta had a baby and its been eating sharp fresh candied dates and little bits of sweet creamy banana  Very nice! Not great projection though', 'I am smitten! That’s all I am wearing for the last three days and that’s saying a lot (I usually change fragrances during the day). This indeed has a “baby wipe” vibe to it, with a much richer almond note - to me very almond-oil. The flower component is marvelous and the tuberose does not overpower the almond, which gives the right balance. To the first spritz to the dry down, this is perfect to me, a true love.', ""This starts off smelling very like Dana's Canoe, the predecessor to Faberge's Brut. .In other words, a sweet fougere, Canoe is well worth tracking down if you like this fragrance. Datura Noir is certainly a pleasant enough aroma. reminding me of a good quality floor polish. The reason for its high price is not immediately obvious, but that applies to quite a few expensive brands."", 'I get the same creamy tuberose that’s in Eau de Soleil Blanc. But this is creamier and stronger. I don’t detect any almond but that’s with any scent.', ""I purchased this in summer, and then I was quite disappointed, as I found it rather heavy and fleeting at the same time. \u2060 \u2060 I retested it in winter and now I understand its appeal fully. It is an utter beauty in colder weather! It opens with a green almond, green like neroli can be green. Immediately, thick tuberose petals start to sing at you. They are classic and confident but not old fashioned as they are backed-up with almonds, coco, vanilla and some myrrh. The perfume also has some fruity nuances, by the addition of Osmanthus and apricot. \u2060 \u2060 I have the black labeled latest formula, which supposedly has less performance and is more vanillic. I haven't compared them. This edition lasts all day on me though, but to have silage I do have to overspray, which I think should never be the case for a higher end perfume. The refined smell is worth it though. It never veers into sunscreen territory."", 'Serge Lutens Datura Noir (2001) Tuberose Almond - One of my favorite tuberose accords. #christophersheldrake starts with Mandarin Oranges mixed with powdery Heliotrope and Almonds. Nutty, creamy, and warm. Then I get a mixture of Tuberose and Vanilla giving off a coconut vanilla ice cream vibe. Thankfully the sweetness is balanced by an incense and tonka bean accord that gives radiance and contrast that dries down to Myrrh and Vanilla.', 'Recommend for men to try. Did not find it girly at all. Good for most seasons. Have some goth lord vibes. Notwithstanding secure for office and give some dark charm at the party. Long-lasting and not overhelming', 'Wish I hadn’t read the comments below that compared this to baby wipes, because I can’t unsmell it now 😂 I keep sniffing my arm, this is a very different scent', 'Simultaneously summery and powdery, the almond and heliotrope are a very nice touch. This doesn’t differentiate much from the opening to the dry down, but I’m fine with that because the heart of the scent is so pleasant. Smooth coconut, powdery heliotrope and almond, with a megadose of dizzying tuberose. It’s sticky, humid and heavy. Despite being undeniably summery in scent profile, it can honestly get cloying during the summer day. But this really is the answer for a sexy summer night date scent. Pairs well if you like wearing Terracotta during the day.', 'I liked it at first because of the gardenia-like opening, but later I realized it’s a sharper and less wearable version of TF soleil blanc. Still a very unique scent. Only last 1 hour on me.', ""I bought this about 2 years ago. One spray, right after it spent some 7 days in shipping, and I decided I hated it. I got none of the beautiful white florals everyone spoke of, and I was so disappointed since my favorite note on the planet is tuberose. It went straight to the cabinet, all the way in the back, never to be touched again.  Recently I was discussing a few of my perfumes with my husband, and we just stood there with cabinet doors opened. He reached for the Datura Noir box and asked me why I never wear it, to which I replied that it was sour and not my kind of white floral fume. He sprayed one spray onto his hand, called me crazy, and walked out, but he left this awesome sweet, pungent aroma trail behind him. I went ahead and did one spray on my neck, figuring I can always shower, but to my surprise, this turned out to be one of my best tuberose perfumes, and if it wasn't for my husband, I would've never known. There is just something special about Datura Noir that I can not pinpoint. It's different than most of the tuberose perfumes I own or I've tried. Sweet and slightly pungent, appropriate for both summer and winter. I wore it in over 100-degree temps and it performed beautifully. It seems that heat accentuates the tuberose and pulls it to the top, which is lucky for me since I am a complete tuberose nut. I recently learned how to date Serge Lutens bottles and my bottle is from July 2011. I don't know how is the performance with the newer bottles, probably not the same, but my Datura Noir lasted about 10-12 hours each time I wore it. I put it back in the cabinet to be used on special occasions until I can find another vintage bottle of it as a backup."", 'I adore this coconutty floral cocktail but my love for it is not reciprocated- it is stunning for about an hour and then vanishes.  Coming from a tropical country, I find this so mysterious and is evocative of a familiar memory that eludes me. I am considering re-adding this to my collection just to enjoy at home.', ""Creamy, coconutty, tuberose heaven. I love the beautiful, powdery almond in this as well. I've been trying to restrain myself when it comes to tuberose scents because I already have far too many in my ever-expanding collection, and the dry down of this shares a lot of similarities with Mancera Velvet Vanilla (another vanillic, bubblegummy tuberose) but this is just different enough that I can almost justify adding it. Almost ;-)"", 'The beige label bottle makes me understand the name ""Datura Noir"". Datura is a plant with a beautiful trumpet-shaped poisonous flower with psychotropic properties. Datura Noir opens with a carnal, mysterious, poisonous tuberose. The lemon blossom refreshes the composition but stays briefly and in the background. The real heart of this composition are heliotrope, vanilla, coconut and of course almond. I also feel a faint scent of Osmanthus, especially in the opening.', 'Страхотно се допълва от Coco vanilla Mancera, горещините го допускат:)', 'I love white florals/tuberose and am not too keen on coconut, so I am happy that despite the initial nutty and coco-nutty opening, Datura Noir is a strong tuberose through and through. The coconut, almond and vanilla give the tuberose a creamy and sweet base. Datura Noir is not dark or gothic like its name may suggest, instead it is ultra feminine in a grown-up way. Moderate projection but good lasting power, also it smells much better on skin than on the tester paper or from the bottle cap.', ""One of my most successful blind buys ever. After blind buying Feminite du Bois and despising the cumin note, which was unrelenting on my skin, I was wary to blind buy any more Serge Lutens fragrances. I had also hesitated with purchasing Datura Noir for so long because I was worried it would be too similar to Songes, at least in vibe. Songes is now gone from my collection and Fragrancenet had an amazing sale on Datura Noir, so after much research, I bit the bullet and purchased the tester. I had been looking for a more summery/tropical fragrance to replace my Songes (which I felt was also ruined by a strong cumin note - why???) and I found it! Although I do enjoy the typical sunscreen/beachy summer scents, I love how this one is different, but still has a bit of a summery vibe. The vanilla, almond, and tuberose blend beautifully together. The heliotrope adds a subtle powderiness. Maybe if I try really hard, I can detect coconut, but had I not known it is a note here, I probably wouldn't pick up on it. I love all the phases of this fragrance. It projects fairly well, and longevity is moderate on skin, I have not sprayed this yet on clothing. I tested this side by side with Keiko Mecheri's Datura Blanche, and although they have similar notes (datura, almond, vanilla, tonka, heliotrope, tuberose), I'd say DB is a bit more gourmand. DN leans more floral on me and seems to perform better overall. DN is pretty versatile, I can see this working well in all seasons, day and night. I can see this one becoming a staple in my collection."", ""Even after several wears, I'm still figuring out my feelings about this one. My first thought upon sampling was oh, Datura Noir... thou art ruined by coconut. There's an accord in here that leans faintly suntan lotion if you focus on it. On subsequent wears, though, I've realized it's balanced by the sugary lilac-y sweetness of the heliotrope, osmanthus, and tuberose. As others have noted, the appearance of the coconut in this seems to wax and wane with every wear; sometimes it's a prominent sunscreen, while other times it's a fresh, almost-fruity suggestion. There are moments as the florals begin to fade away that the coconut dominates the fragrance along with the gourmand almond-vanilla-tonka. These moments are my least favorite part of the fragrance, where the gourmand sweet notes can get a touch doughy and stale as that moderately unnatural coconut nestles between them. Something about the coconut-heliotrope vibe here reminds me a lot of Pacifica's French Lilac, although coconut isn't listed as a note in that one and lilac isn't listed in Datura Noir. This one is a bit more tempered and less sugary honey-sweet, but that delicious heliotrope is still prominent. I wanted this one for the lemon blossom, as the smell of my lemon tree in full bloom is the most dizzyingly beautiful scent in the world, and somehow I can't find the note featured prominently in any fragrance (or essential oil) anywhere. I wasn't really expecting it to be prominent here, and it isn't; I can imagine where the lemon blossom might lie hidden among this floral bouquet, but it hasn't risen up and introduced itself to me. I ordered this 1 ml sample when I was practically falling asleep in my chair, so I accidentally added two of them to cart without realizing. I'm still unsure whether I want to hold onto one, let alone both. Its heliotrope-sweet similarity to my bottle of French Lilac makes it something I don't really need, but I'm going to keep wearing this and exploring its nuances more. The subtle nutty sweetness of the almond is a welcome one; it mostly isn't too doughy or cloying here as almond sometimes is, but a soft suggestion of something warm. The apricot and osmanthus fruity floral whisper in here is another; I'm often cautious about pomaceous and stone fruits in fragrances because they often feel artificial and out-of-place, but these feel delicious and real enough to me. Personally, I wouldn't buy more of this; it feels like a much more expensive, moderately more nuanced version of a sugary-coconut-heliotrope fragrance I already own. It's definitely enjoyable, though, and, but for the volatility of that coconut accord, entirely delightful."", 'This is WOW for me. I do not like tuberose, but it is so fantastic in this fragrance.', 'melted marzipan draped over plump rainier cherries, dulcified and deliquesced. sensuous grace in a rococo cafe, rocaille and coquille with powdered cheeks and a corset tightly bound to the ribcage. edwardian elegance! maraschinos enveloped by silk. lace-covered legs sprawled across a red gingham picnic blanket under peach clouds, drunk on cherry liqueur, aristocratic roleplay with the decadence to match.  benzaldehyde bliss.. sophisticated, regal sweetness.  songs for datura noir: fairly terry by variété, stilyagi by puro instinct, néas chilckilg by co-mix.', ""There's a hint of osmanthus in here, but like others have said...Datura Noir is not an osmanthus perfume. Osmanthus is nowhere to be found. It's been sacrificed to summon this wicked essence. The opening is pure sunblock. The tuberose-coconut-vanilla combination smells just like the reef unsafe lotion that leaves a layer of grease on the surface of the water. After a few minutes, the heavy sunscreen diffuses a bit to let an odd bitterness slip through. It's a flower I don't recognize, tempting and mysterious but that cyanide aura lets me know that it is poison. The dry down is creamy and intimate, close to the skin unlike the room-filling blast that comes with the initial spray. It's shimmery, light and silky, while hints of that thick, heavy tuberose-coconut lurk underneath. Inhale too deeply and it's a mouthful of perfume. It's probably the name, but it feels menacing...an angel of death. Beautiful composition. I'm not sure how accurately it portrays Datura Noir. I've got a different Datura perfume that also uses osmanthus plus powdery, musky, and green elements so I imagine the true flower must be along those lines. It does feel quite mature and elegant. I have my doubts about being able to wear this without seeming like I've snuck into my mother's dresser. On the other hand, I can imagine her wearing this for a nice, informal occasion."", ""If you were a child of the 90's like me, there are a few ubiquitous things that frame your childhood: Furbies, stirrup pants, Tamagotchis, the golden age of Nickelodeon. Hours roaming the neighborhood unattended, listening to Mambo No. 5 on your swanky portable CD player without giving the lyrics a second thought. It was a simpler time, as childhoods are, filled with those things that scents in particular bring back en force. Do you remember those scented markers? I sure do, because Datura Noir smells exactly like the blueberry one.  It's not a bad perfume. If I didn't have this association I might even like it. If I concentrate, I can get a little vanilla, a little musk, a little osmanthus. But the wafts of synthetic blueberry come screaming off of my skin and drench every note in horrible scented marker accord. I cannot get past it, and I don't think I ever will.  I'll pass my decant to someone else and hope that their skin chemistry is wildly different than mine."", 'top notes: sweet jolly rancher blast. grape candy.  middle: white florals. specifically plumeria.

I expected a creamy tuberose layered with coconut and this is exactly what I get during the first minutes after spraying it. It sets in with some kind of a murky green note later though. Maybe I’m exaggerating, but this makes me think of some tropical wilderness. The sensual tuberose is always present and so is the dark side of it. I got a lot of compliments while wearing a decant but I’m not likely to go for a FB so far since this scent is somewhat overwhelming for me. Edit: I decided to take a risk and ended up purchasing an old FB, and it was a really succesful buy. I get more almonds and the scent is even better than what I've remembered from my decant! Love it."", ""I'm always fascinated at the variability of scents with varying chemistry. On me, this opens with a blast of gardenia - no tuberose, jasmine, or other white flowers.  As it settles, a touch of vanilla, so slight, just a grace note, wafts by. It's lighter than I expected, with vanilla, heliotrope, and tonka all listed. The osmanthus comes and goes, teasing, did I just catch ... ? No, it's gone again. Then an odd, rubbery, almost plastic note emerges, here then gone. Vaguely narcotic, green, dark, and lush. I detect no myrrh at all. On me, it's all top and middle notes. It's an odd scent. At first I thought linear, but it's not - it shifts the way water drops sparkle in sunlight. I've never smelled Datura vines or Angel's Trumpet. I'm only familiar with the variety called Jimsonweed that Georgia O 'Keefe painted. This is too green and lush for that desert bloom. And yet this fits the picture of that Datura well. Longevity is excellent, silage is noticable, but office safe. It's not sweet or harsh and unlikely to offend. You will be one of a kind wearing this. I do feel it's a bit overpriced, only because a full bottle is out of my price range. Quality as suits Serge. Very unique and special."", 'Unpopular opinion: I agree Datura Noir could give off summery vibe (definitely not beachy...), but I find this to be very cosy during colder months. I cannot wait to try!

This is definitely a distinct tuberose scent, but not heavy and overwhelming as tuberose often is. This was not really powdery for me, maybe very lightly, but not that stick in your throat gaggy powdery so many perfumes have. Longevity is apparently not a thing for Serge Lutens anymore, as I got a couple hours out of it and barely more than a skin scent from the beginning. If it had better longevity and a bit more sillage it might be worth the price, but as is, I would not repurchase for the price.', ""The vanilla+heliotrope smells so much like Corolle dolls! Fortunately it doesn't stop there. It is a powdery flower, possibly different in colder weather but the imagery I get from it is definitely influenced by the fact that it is the beginning of spring. The almond is the almond fruit, not the nut - green and milky. It all smells like a night-blooming flower, and the moon is full, and the night is young and anything could happen .This is not a romantic flower, it is the scent of THE Flower as a fertility symbol- it's sensual, warm and full of life. There's something pagan about it, I wonder how it would benefit from being layered with something a tad bitter or earthy. Mesmerizing, beautiful, I want it and I only wish it were more potent and long-lasting (it does hold well on clothes but my skin drinks it in a couple of hours)"", '""Sweet Heliotrope Cloud surrounding Angel\'s Trumpets"" a long time ago when I was just getting obsessed with perfume I tried Datura Noir and thought it was too pedestrian, too pretty, too easy and ""Un-Serge Lutens."" I did, of course, like it, but thought it wasn\'t edgy enough. I did also wear it and finish a bottle all the while thinking it was just too pretty. I think some frag-nerds might recognize this stage where you want everything to be odd, unusual, complicated and edgy. I\'m at the stage now when I simply want notes that are beautiful or sexy or easy to wear and will hold up for at least 4-6 hours. I recently purchased a new bottle of Datura Noir (black box and lettering) and must tell you I still like it (yes, I really do love it). Datura Noir is all about the datura flower (aka angel\'s trumpets) which are a very specific scent (I used to grow these in my garden so I know this scent well). I don\'t think this smells much at all like tuberose - it\'s Datura/Angel\'s Trumpets all the way. It\'s just this gorgeous combination of Datura + Almond + Heliotrope that is very sweet and sexy. The Datura is a green-laced scent and so is the almond note here. Really beautiful but I think it helps when you actually know what this flower smells like. The downside is that the black label bottles in the black boxes have been reformulated and the longevity is abysmal. This lasts under 90 minutes on me. I wish I had bought a back up bottle a long time ago when I could get the original formula. UPDATE: coming back to say I tracked down an original bottle (cream label & box) and am now finding it to be different than I remembered! The black label & box is more heliotrope/almond while the original cream label actually smells more like sweet tuberose-vanilla. Strangely not how I remembered it and thinking I might like the reformulation/new packaging better. Update: September 2021. Coming back to say this is one of the DREAMIEST scents I’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing. I don’t get coconut. This is mostly an almondy-Tuberose/Angel Trumpet on me. Very cloudlike, so floaty and gentle. Like gentle waves of a soft vanilla marzipan white floral. Delicate and feminine.', ""si vous aimez les parfums vanillés tels que nuxe prodigieux et terracota de guerlain, vous pouver acheter datura noir, il partage le m^me adn mais est bien plus raffiné.

To me, this is a mix of a bitter/sweet that makes it interesting. It's a heady, lush floral fragrance that must be worn cautiously as it can be cloying in hot weather.  The drydown is the most notable part where the oriental facettes of the fragrance come out: myhrr and tonka bean. I like it better on a gentleman (provided he can wear such a different-from-the-rest fragrance) but not so much on me. Projects well and has longevity.

Reading more of the reviews though made me reconsider opening the packaging and I'm glad I took the time to go to the shop and test it. I'm learning that niche should always be sniffed before purchased, unless you are dead sure of what you're buying. I feel designer fragrances are almost always safer blind buys (at least for me!) due to their crowd-pleasing compositions. Anyhow, coming back to DN, on me this is literally Goutal's Eau de Charlotte (a perfume that tends to divide and be as inexplicable as this one). If I would not have already Eau de Charlotte, maybe I would have kept Datura Noir, which is a more intricate version of the previous, drying down with very subtle hints of vanilla rather than cocoa, appearing a bit more potent than Charlotte. Another reviewer below said that Datura Noir is like baby wipes, this is also the general feeling about Eau De Charlotte, a sweet, ultra flowery, powdery, ultra-feminine scent that I love to wear casually during daytime, but can be considered a bit dated. I was looking for a more affirmative winter scent this time, so I went for Santal Majuscule. But to be considered also are Feminite du Bois, which is quite unique. So far this Santal is one of the most wearable sandalwoods I've tried so far, drying up to fresh and perky tones of rose and vanilla (after an initial hit of caramel-toffee and spices).

Anyway there is something about this perfume that smells/tastes like a nasal spray (I can’t remember which with a green cap) I used to use before I had it corrected. Its not as bad as it sounds, I think the spray was lightly fragranced but it does mean when I spray this perfume I expect to taste it, which is so strange.  My husband loves this one on me.', ""I want to love this fragrance so bad as it is an SL tuberose based fragrance.. but i don't get any of the vanilla or tuberose.. all i get is the mix of heliotrope and almond.The sharpness of the heliotrope and the bitter almond makes me a bit dizzy."", ""Although I probably won't miss it in my collection, I find this one really special.Don't know why exactly, but haven't smelled something like that. It wants to be white floral, but it isn't, there is obvious almond and vanilla side of it, but it doesn't make it edible or too sweet. But I still find something sharp about it that I don't like. Plus, longevity is really bad."", 'I agree with the other reviewer below who compared this to Yves Rocher Monoi. If I sniff, I smell tiare and coconut with a hint of yellow underneath (and as it develops, something darker--but not actually dark--in the depths...maybe that is the myrrh grounding it, but it doesn\'t smell like myrrh in this iteration). I don\'t get all the other notes listed in the pyramid. To me, this is a simple, warm, light, summery fragrance (although if I put my nose close to my wrist and inhale deeply, it is heady). In the spirit of this fragrance, I\'ve decided to order more of YR\'s monoi body oil (of which they are doing BOGO today on it so that\'s a win). This parfum will smell beautiful layered with monoi oil, and it can certainly only help with the longevity.  As with most fragrances I\'ve had that contain some version of the word ""noir"" ""night"" ""midnight"" etc., Datura Noir isn\'t dark and deep and decadent, it is merely a soft version of the notes in the frag, which I suppose is now perfume speak for ""wear this at night for bed."" To me, this is the opposite of a night frag... this perfume belongs in the sun. While the color of the juice in the bottle absolutely matches my olfactory experience of it, the name is completely wrong. I love the name, it just doesn\'t suit this fragrance.  I love this one. I\'m not sure about longevity yet (still going strong after an hour) or if the development is going to be complex (I suspect not), but taken at face value this one is a winner for a beautifully uncomplicated daytime summer scent. EDIT: I did some reading about the Datura flower, and apparently at night the flowers unfurl and give off a honeysuckle-ish sweet scent that attracts moths and other bugs to pollinate it...and the flower is only open from dusk until noon. So yes, apparently the name Datura Noir is spot-on. My apologies to Serge for second-guessing his naming of this one. Now I like it even more.', 'I now get what people mean by bubble gum tuberose with this one. There is a faint hint of a pink powdery bubblegum note. The main notes I get are tuberose, coconut and almond. I’d like to point that this coconut smells like coconut flakes which is the type I like.  Datura Noir is very soft and mildly sweet. It’s practically a skin scent and doesn’t last long. It’s pretty though. This could be a sister of Amouage Love Tuberose.', ""Sharp, waxy bubblegum tuberose and osmanthus that transitions into powdery bubblegum tuberose and osmanthus. The powder must be coming from the heliotrope, because I don't smell any almond at all. I don't blame the perfume, I blame my weird skin which amplifies tuberose like crazy to the detriment of every other note. I don't get any almond or vanilla whatsoever, and definitely no coconut (which is fine, I hate it 75% of the time in perfume, although I was curious about Lutens' take on it). I can't believe there's tonka in here. So far, the only tuberose perfume that has worked beautifully for me is the now sadly discontinued Mahora from Guerlain."", 'Summer: yes Versatile:nah Longevity:6 Sillage:6 Uniqueness:4 Overall:5 بودري، ناعم، نظافة، بجامة', 'This smells like frosting made out of flower petals. Not quite edible. Warm, sunny, happy and just romantic as heck. Love.', ""This perfume fits perfectly in any situation, during any season! It's sweet, interesting and it's clean! I love how it's unique in a very sophisticated, refined way."", 'creamy lush humid sunscreen.  if I smelled this blindfolded I would think there was tiara flower.  an easy love if you like Guerlain Terracotta, Yves Rocher monoi.  I find it gorgeous. smelling the newer black bottle.', ""Tropical oriental gourmand. This is so intoxicating. I've never liked white flowers until I smelled this. Marzipan embedded with datura petals sent from heaven. Incredible."", 'Blind bought this bottle YEARS ago and it\'s been sitting on the shelf forgotten until this summer. Maybe my taste has changed because I absolutely LOVE this! Smells the most fresh and natural of the other Serge Lutens fragrances I\'ve smelled. In my mind, tuberose is labeled as a ""old vintage, heavy and thick"" scent. I somehow group it with older, mature women. Yet THIS smells youthful, ethereal and slightly tropical to me. I think the coconut mixed with tuberose gives it a sweet but not gourmand feel, it smells pastel yellow rather than a buttery golden yellow so I wear it as a day time summer fragrance. Only thing that I can complain about is the longevity and sillage, I give this maybe 6 sprays and yet it still becomes a skin scent with 2 or 3 hours. Disappointing but this scent makes me happy!', ""Datura is a night blooming flower that is beautiful and delicate, but poisonous. Between the name and Lutens's description, I hoped this perfume would be dark, exotic, and sensuous. Alas, all I'm getting is a middling tuberose. It's fairly one-dimensional, with the almond accentuating the flower's sweetness and nothing else. I have to wonder if the sample I'm trying is a reformulated version of Datura Noir, because I'm not getting any complexity at all, the sillage was nil, and it faded within an hour an a half. If you're looking for a very sweet, gourmand-leaning tuberose that isn't indolic, green, or sunscreen-like, you are better off with Amouage's Love Tuberose."", '""Like a diabolic trail of smoke left by Satan in Paradise. Some say this fragrance will enthrall you; others that it will make you crazy. Others still that excessive exposure will kill you dead. To be precise, one night I took brugmansia, also known as Angel\'s Trumpet, and distilled the notes of its lingering memory.""  This is really beautiful. It\'s smooth, creamy, sweet and very rounded. Very delicious and multilayered. It starts off completely floral but slowly morphs into a strong almondy-vanilla musky thing that really relaxes into the skin. I wouldn\'t say it\'s super light and fleeting, but it does become essentially a skin scent in only 2 or 3 hours (I know I have skin that just soaks up fragrance so it may vary). Overall, it\'s really beautiful and relaxing. 8/10', 'Lovely florals/powder bomb, not overly offensive as I’m a powderphobe when it comes to fragrances.. more likened to a nicely scented talc, although not for me, quite feminine imo and I don’t usually separate unless something leans fairly extreme towards my perception of feminine fragrance, I don’t really see it as a gourmand although it is slightly sweetened by the vanilla and tonka which are used well, I feel it’s more oriental, objectively it’s a nice composition and I can see why it’s well liked, I smell the coconut and almond but only after looking at the notes can I identify them.', 'Upon first spray my impression was that this is like beach walk, but much colder and without the saltiness. It also gave me an instant wave of nostalgia, like the smell of a scented toy as a little kid or a type of candy, maybe I am sensing a “bubblegum” tuberose? I put a spray of beach walk on my other wrist and Beach Walk projects larger, arms length at least for the first couple of hours, then they are similar strength. Beach Walk smells much more like skin than Datura Noir and I think that is due to the relative warmth. The colder impression of Datura Noir isn’t refreshing, I think it is cold mostly due to a sharp sweetness, which may be the almond and coconut. It does remind me of Hypnotic Poison a couple of hours in, but has stronger white floral aspect and is missing the absinthe and herbaceous notes.', ""This is quite lovely. It's thicker than I expected! The almond and coconut are very dominant and, as others have said, the tuberose is watery. I struggle to categorize this in a traditional wear time category: is it more night appropriate or day? Maybe that lends to its versatility? I'm not sure I'd be willing to reach for this on a hot day (>90F) so maybe spring days and summer nights make the most sense?  Pontification aside, this is a lovely gourmand white floral. Sits close to the skin but has decent lasting power (6+ hours). A welcome addition."", ""This has quickly became one of my favorite scents in my entire collection. I got a sample of this a year or so ago, and I thought it was nice, but nothing special. I recently revisited my sample and found it so much more interesting and beautiful! I really get the coconut note strongly, paired nicely with a powdery almond and a very clean smelling tuberose. There isn't anything indolic in this one, it's reminiscent to the tuberose note that is in Gucci Bloom and other modern white florals. There's something reminiscent in this of a tropical sunscreen, a nostalgic beach vacation memory in the back of my mind whenever I smell this one.  I placed it on my wantlist and recently pulled the trigger on a very affordable bottle from fragrancenet. Their picture shows the older style packaging, but here is a head's up: they are actually selling the newer style bottle. When I received it in the mail, I was quite upset. But I decided to open it up and give it a fair chance. What I smell from this bottle is not much different than what was in my older sample. The performance is not very potent, but neither was the older one of this scent in particular. I remember thinking the sillage of my sample was very weak, and that kept me from desiring a bottle at first. But eventually I decided the scent was just so good that I wanted to own it anyway. This newer bottle of Datura Noir does the job, and the longevity is actually more long lasting than I thought it would be; at least 6 or 7 hours on my skin. I find myself craving it the close we get to sunny spring days. I could also see it being good for the Summer months, or tropical beach vacations."", 'I love this. A wilted, watery tuberose. Slightly powdery with wafts of coconut and warm spices. Perhaps my five year old son said it best: “Mmm...you smell like a humongous bottle of sunscreen.” It smells like high end cosmetics of a bygone era or really fragrant tanning oil. Definitely giving off beachy summer vibes.', 'If I layer this with M. Micallef Royal Muska dear God! Dear Lord! I’ve died and gone to heaven. It’s white floral, pure cream, sweet, deep woody pure clean musk. I actually want to bite my wrist.', 'This beauty is a huge love for me! The first time I smelled it I was reminded of Hypnotic Poison, and indeed both feature tuberose, almond, vanilla, and coconut. Without having them side by side at this moment, I would say Datura is more floral and less vanillic than HP, and without the sandalwood, creating a more delicate emotional story. I do still get a bit of HP\'s ""root beer"" effect from this one though! The tuberose in this scent is kind of melancholy and watery smelling, like it has been coaxed into a more vulnerable place by the other floral notes in the blend. You still get a beautiful rubbery Tuberose, but I think the lemon blossom/osmanthus/apricot do a lot to keep it away from full carnal vulgarity. Along with the white floral presence, heliotrope and almond are big stars here, creating the creamy intoxicating base that defines the scent. Some creamy scents can gag me (Initio Psychedelic Love), but I\'m happy to say this one gets it right! I love the Tim Burton connection that others have drawn below. Yes, this could be the personal scent of the gentle and misunderstood recluse Edward Scissorhands. Datura leaves the impression of a beautiful, weird, misshapen flower, or maybe of the Corpse Bride\'s wilting bouquet. If you use your imagination of course :) Lastly, while I am a fan of beachy, suntan lotion-y scents, this is not fully that. While there is a tropical island vibe that others have noted, it\'s not full-on. This is only halfway to a Bronze Goddess or Soleil Blanc, while the other half lands somewhere near a wedding-day white floral.', '\'With a taste of your lips I\'m on a ride!\'  An interesting floral almond scent, one which is surprisingly long-lasting for a Lutens floral. While I\'ve never smelled datura flowers myself, the combination of the slightly bitter almond and the tuberose does give a sort of ""poison floral"" effect with subtle alcoholic elements. It is powdery and liqueur-like, and overall quite sweet (think poisonous flowers and leaves sticking out of a vase of (low percentage) almond booze). This fragrance leans feminine but not outrageously so; it feels very much like an evening scent. I\'m afraid I don\'t get much coconut - I think it has been blended into the almond (which has, itself, been blended into the tuberose) to give what is largely a single odour. Despite not really exhibiting the typical elements of a white floral (no indole, nothing piercing) this is still a seductive and heady composition, the sort that feels like it ought to be hallucinogenic, perhaps better suited to almond gourmand-lovers than floral fans.', ""For a time I was unreasonably obsessed with this fragrance and part of me still is but, after buying a small sample size I decided a full-sized bottle could wait. This fragrance is definitely an enigmatic enigma of a twisted tale. If Tim Burton's movies or laboratory had a scent, Datura Noir would be wafting through the creaking mahogany floorboards. There's just something so somber, quiet but artful about this scent which seems to captivate some and fly straight by others. The notes are practically like a beach cocktail and whilst I can understand and get those vibes it's also so serious, almost deadly and utterly addictive. Stay away if you wear your perfumed heart on your sleeves and if you're not ready to commit to confusion and heartache - you just might fall in lust."", ""She's a shape-shifter. It opens with fresh citrus and some bright lovely lemon blossom.  There's some stone fruit, rounded and juicy if you sniff it on the right day. It eases you into a tuberose that plays between creamy and a little bit cold and herbal. But it's so enriched and propped up by other elements that you might not know exactly what you're getting.  When the vanilla enters the picture I get a more indolic tuberose; it borders on unclean. The candied, toasted myrrh deepens the sweet filth of it.  But sometimes I just get bitter almond and a tiny bit of coconut. Here the tuberose submits to the other notes and eases the edge of the almonds a bit.  I need more time to think about this one!"", ""I think this is the most beautiful perfume I own. Ever since I was a child and used to spend summers in Hawaii with my parents, I have fallen in love with jasmine, tuberose, plumeria, and all varieties of white flowers. And somehow, it runs in the family that we all love coconuts. So really, I couldn't ask for anything more with Datura Noir. It brings back memories of vacations in the tropics, it envelops me in its warmth, it tempts my senses with its buttery creaminess. When you wear it behind the ear, it gives a sense that you have jasmine in your hair.  I think it's an all season all-weather fragrance, despite being tropical; its sophisticated enough to wear as a signature.  The old Serge Lutens bottles with the beige labels are so chic - I wish they would re-release them. Can't stand the black label."", ""While I already loved this beautiful white floral when I purchased it, I believe it may now be becoming a fairly solid favourite. At the ripe young age of 24, I feel like I'm slowly coming into my own and this fragrance seems to be the coming-of-age scent to commemorate this realisation. While it's still a bit chilly, the post-Winter days of the beginning of Spring suit this fragrance exceptionally. The warmth of the almond, coconut and vanilla suit the chill and the cheery, though austere, white florals suit the rare rays of warm sunshine. As I am in a warm office, though, the florals are mostly what amplify on my skin during the day.  I showed this to my friend this morning and she described it, rather candidly, as an 'orgasm in (her) nose' which seemed a perfect description to me. It has a strange meaty carnality to it, while also being very sweet (in demeanor) and elegant. Would always suggest to a floral fragrance lover."", ""The dry down on this is divine. A sweet coconut, nutty, and white floral with complexity and depth backing it up, and oh so well blended. It takes time to develop for me, 30min to 1hr and then it hits, and it stays for more than 8 hr. I usually don't reach for it out of impatience. My only complaint is its poor silage, it goes unnoticed unless someones really close. I guess I could go crazy and overspray myself, but I would smell like a rotting tuberose and too sweet crushed Smarties candy bomb while waiting for it that dry down I love. Recommend in fall or winter, it does ok in summer but this performs so much better in cool weather. Edit- After time and many trials from decants, this is still loved and a full bottle was purchased. I gravitate towards it in warm weather though silage is lower than cooler months."", ""This tuberose perfume is unique and for the sophisticated lady. It opens very strongly and almost intoxicating but in a few minutes it settles into a beautifuly powdered tuberose. I don't normally like tuberose in perfumes but this one is truly well blended. Will buy another bottle soon."", 'Very sweet almondy-heliotrope opening. Gourmand. Something here is reminiscent of chewable children’s aspirin on the drydown. This is my first sniff of lutens. It certainly smells smooth and high quality but it fades so fast from the dabber. I think fior d’aqua is a superior scent if you are looking for Datura. Edit: this perfume reminds me of blossom love’ by amouage, but lighter and fresher. Also, I’ll be darned but I believe there is cashmeran in the base of this. Either that or after working in the monkey house all you smell is monkeys 🐒 ... Meaning I’m smelling Cashmeran in a lot of scents recently.', 'What a stunner! ♥ Milky coconut, fleshy tuberose and float-y heliotrope with soft, fresh fruits make this the creamiest, most edible floral ever. Definitely unique. To me, this smells like ocean waves and night blooming flowers, with a hint of lingering suntan lotion that the breeze lifts from your skin. Elegant and relaxed. Update: This positively blooms in the cold.', ""- When I wear this the following words run through in my mind: sweet. almondy. sunshine. creamy tuberose. creamy coconut lotion. High end suncream. Smells great. Also smells like barbie dolls to me, of all things. It's linear with an intimate scent cloud of sillage and decent (4 to 6 hour) longevity...ideal for how I like my perfumes. I like DN. I have a travel spray from fragrancenet."", 'If this was poisonous then I’d be in real trouble because I want to eat it and roll around in it. It’s absolutely delicious! I love marzipan, coconut, vanilla, and white flowers so I’m a sucker for this. What struck me first is the smell of almonds and I immediately went to thoughts of marzipan. Marzipan is the only candy I could eat until I get sick. The coconut and vanilla are very subdued and not cloying at all but have the SL fresh touch. The tuberose goes so well with these other fleshy notes. The apricots, myrrh, and osmanthus give it a subtle blast of herbal menthol which surprisingly give it nice balance and weight for the more prominent floral and creamy sweet notes to sing. How does SL do these strange medicinal notes so well? SL seem to be the blackbelts of balance. It’s not too sweet or too medicinal or too loud or powdery, too fruity, or sharp or bright. It’s another Goldie Locks from SL in that it’s just right. The real stand outs are the almond, vanilla, osmanthus, myrrh, and the tuberose to me. If you love almond, tuberose, and don’t mind osmanthus (or like it) then buy it! Don’t hesitate you need this fragrance in your life.  Other people have noted that the sillage is fantastic in this one. Unfortunately, for me it happens to be the opposite. My skin just devours some fragrances and this one is no exception. It’s almost like my body wants to eat and absorb everything I love. Lol This fragrance is friendly, gentle to the point of being baby like. Something about it reminds me of when my little boy was a baby in diapers. Very sun tan lotion, lactonic, smooth, and whispers of gourmand on me. I ddn’t even think that I liked gourmand fragrances. I can tell this is going to be one of those fragrances that pulls me into a new fragrance genre. Someone should make a marzipan dessert based on this fragrance. I’m falling in love with Serge Lutens. I wish I could own every single fragrance in this house. I feel like I have perfumes I love, but then there are perfumes that are incandescent soulmates. This and SL A La Nuit are both my soulmates.  Update: I wore this again today and the longevity was about 5 hours so immediately bought a full bottle of this. I’ll just wear a lot of it when I apply it! I couldn’t resist this one. It’s just too beautiful not to own. My full bottle came today and it seems way stronger! It’s got way better sillage and longevity than the sample I got. I’m thrilled with this fragrance. It’s the most beautiful fragrance I’ve smelled in years.', 'Gorgeous white floral fragrance. Maybe my new favorite of that genre. I am really enjoying this travel size, and plan on keeping an eye out for a full bottle of this.', ""This is FRAUD!!! There's no trace of datura, nor anything noir. Instead, it's a gourmand of light to medium weight, dominated by a notable presence of tuberose. It begins with an undercurrent of slightly bitter almond, which has a hint of booziness to it. From the outset, the tuberose is there, lurking behind the almond. As it progresses, this silky tuberose, along with a mix of other sweeter florals, takes center stage, complemented by a delightful, higher-toned creamy coconut note. Gradually, more substantial gourmand facets like heliotrope, vanilla, and tonka emerge from the base, gaining prominence at certain points, only for the fragrance to eventually settle into a harmonious blend of smooth tuberose, with only a touch of gourmands left. The perfect word to describe this perfume is 'smooth'— smoother than liquid milk."", 'Delicate tuberose. Datura Noir highlights the fragility of the flower,. Everything melds into an indolic, lightly nuanced by other notes, white bloom. Like being in a tropical garden at night. In the dark, fragrance is intensified by heightened senses. Damp air holds the smell, and traces of other blooms mingle so seamlessly they are indistinguishable. White tuberose, a luminous specter, calls out with its siren sweetness. Irresistible.', 'This was a recent blind purchace for me and I’ve been taking a few days to get to know this newbie in my collection and the verdict is in: I am SO in love, it is ridiculous. I fell fast and I fell hard. I was nervous blind purchasing my first Lutens as I read that Serge Lutens wasn’t the most approachable of houses and not a safe blind buy for most people. Well, for my nose it turned out to be completely safe. So much so that I immediately ventured into another Serge blind buy right after receiving this one. My second one was Un bois Vanille, which I also ended up loving (although it took some more sniffing than with the datura noir to find the love, but I did find it) and now I really want to try a third Lutens, so Clair de Musc is on my radar now.  But on to the scent. It is simply dreamy. It is soft, natural, creamy floral, sweet. One of the best creamy florals I have smelt and my favourite tuberose atm. I can see myself wearing this any season, any occasion. It would make a great signature. I feel it leans more feminine, it’s seductive and a little bit carnal but oh so wearable and beautiful. I get the sunscreen reference but in a more of a natural rainforesty type of way rather than your typical by the pool type. Datura noir has given me blind faith in Serge Lutens. It is fast becoming one of my favorite houses thanks to this very successful introduction. Highly reccomend.', ""This is a very weird feeling, when i smelled this, i instantly bought it. For me the impression which i wanted to keep alive and for myself was - the bush of jasmine in grandmother's garden. Then i come here and read, that this is tonka, coconut, tuberose, almonds?????? WOW.... this contradiction messes with my perfume lover brain, but not makes loving Datura Noir less. A very natural, feminine and quite easy to wear scent."", ""This is basically Carnal Flower with some coconut and creaminess added. If you love tuberose you'll probably love this."", 'Nice floral scent. Creamy and quite gourmand thanks to almond and vanilla notes but not sweet. Very feminine. Safe for day use and office. Sillage is soft to moderate, longevity is about 6 hours.', ""I have to be in the mood for very sweet floral perfume to fully enjoy this on myself. With the exception of Daim Blond and Five O'clock Au Gingembre, I actually feel this way about most Serge Lutens. Love his fragrances individually and the line as a whole but overall I've grown out of them. Datura Noir hits the spot when I'm craving coconut and sweet sweet white florals. Somehow I am reminded of Jasmins Marzipane with this. They both have a softness and summer's night sort of feel about them. Both containing almond and both pretty sweet, except Datura Noir is sweeter and a little less versatile. I'll probably wear this on summer's evenings once I've come home and can relax on the porch with a cocktail or an evening get together with friends. It can be worn during the day of course but I fear it could become cloying in the heat. Because I've been getting away from very sweet scents the 10 ml I have will most likely last the rest of the year. If I make another SL purchase it'll be for one of his other florals. The cleaner, simple florals of the house like A La Nuit & Un Lys rival many niche floral scents and are under appreciated."", 'My Swiss lover let me try this on him. I have tried many on him, mostly he tolerates my perfume obsession and lets me spray an array of scents on him as he\'s walking out the door, but this one he loves. Says it\'s ""Very pleasant and a bit erotic, sweet... not too much"". (Which is one of the longest sentences I\'ve heard him use in regards to perfume)  Datura Noir is very heavy on the tuberose, but its carnal flower it really works on a man.  I find it a very sexy scent on a woman,  On a man your heading into raunchy Territory.', ""My quest for the perfect almond heliotrope is over. So impressed at 1st spray… which is quite a feat, considering I've never been crazy about Serge Lutens house. Gorgeous, rich, musky almondy, heliotrope and tuberose accord. However I neither get vanilla, nor coconut, while my BF clearly detects the former. Apricot and osmanthus tend to smell like freshly cleaned skin on me.  Because of that musky quality, I therefore would not consider this perfume a gourmand per se. Yet, its nutty and rounded aura makes a perfect, comforting bed scent. ADD-ON 24th Feb 2019: Some people were in utter shock, because of Datura Noir operture's striking resemblance to amphetamine solvent and speed. That's literal hard drug semantics!"", 'My first Lutens! Another blind buy for me (I\'m a risk taker! ;) ), I tried it for the first time today and I am really enjoying the experience! Having no idea what datura or it\'s relatives smell like, I wasn\'t as disconcerted as several others who have stated that this smells nothing like it. I am getting lovely coconut and jasmine, though not the sunscreen smell often associated with that combo. Then, out of nowhere, the gourmand facets come into play, giving me delicious whiffs of what I can only describe as grown up Marshmallow Fluff! I am not a fan of gourmand scents. They are a dime a dozen these days and I never could see the allure of smelling like a cookie or cupcake. My age is probably a factor, but I prefer scents that have a slightly sexy and seductive quality to them, and I don\'t find overly sweet scents provide that vibe. This is different, and may very well be the most adult gourmand I have ever worn. Yes, there are plenty of gorgeous white flowers present throughout, so it may not be an official gourmand, but this well blended and deeply layered perfume offers just enough creamy sweetness that when it pops up, I enjoy it. I am so glad I took a chance on this and I look forward to wearing it throughout this fall and winter. A definite ""love""!', 'A mysterious,nocturnal scent... almond,tuberose and heliotrope are the notes i feel the most and create a very mysterious alchemy.

It's nearly gone already after only an hour of wearing; I have to really jam my nose into my wrist to detect anything. Too bad because the notes are quite nice. To me it resembles a watered-down version of Estee Lauder Tuberose Gardenia, which in itself to me is a watered-down version of Isabey Gardenia."", 'Today I finally received a reply to my emails to the French house of Serge Lutens I inquired as to the concept of Datura Noir and whether it was based on Datura flowers or just an interpretation of a poisonous floral. To all of you who speak French here it is Cher Monsieur, Nous vous remercions de l’intérêt que vous portez à notre marque. Nous avons bien reçu votre e-mail et nous nous excusons pour le délais de notre réponse. Nous souhaitons vous informer que notre parfum Datura Noir est composé de Datura, une plante que nous trouvons principalement au Mexique et dans le sud-ouest des Etats-Unis, d\'amande et de noix de coco. Nous vous invitons donc à le découvrir dans nos points de vente dont vous trouverez la liste complète sur notre site internet:  Nous restons à votre disposition pour tout complément d\'information. A très bientôt, The most relevant piece I will translate to the English readers. ""We wish to inform you our fragrance, Datura Noir is composed of Datura, a plant that we find mainly in Mexico and in the South Western United States, Almond and Coconut."" Well, it may be stating the obvious? There you have it, the smell of Datura Noir. X', ""Deep, heady, lush flowers. To me like lily and lilac in full humid bloom in an enclosed area. I would actually like a tad more almond and coconut, I'm getting more apricot for some reason. I very much thought of Sand and Sable (Jasmine, Tuberose, Peach), but the flowers fill up the nose more with full bloom sharpness that is intoxicating at first. Pretty amazing. I'd be lucky to have a bottle but I haven't decided if it's on my short list yet."", 'I researched the concept behind this confounding fragrance, to better understand it\'s apparent lack of smelling like Datura flowers or evoking a sense of noir, based on consumer reviews on Fragrantica. So I delved into the archives and struck gold in early reviews of this near 20 Year scent. Firstly, It seems I\'m on the same page as Serge Lutens, or his nose on this one, Christopher Sheldrake, with a description on the Lutens web page, back on it\'s release in 2001, proclaiming they ""took a Brugmansia flower one night and distilled the notes of it\'s lingering memory"". Apparently Datura, among many other flowers can only be created by memory. I take it Brugmansia, aka Angel\'s Trumpet, gets the same treatment, though only related to the poisonous Datura. It seems common to misinterpret the species as the actual Datura. And in this case, Datura noir has been modelled on Brugmansia, so does not reflect true Datura blooms. The flowers scent has been described as having elements of sweet apricot and plum, hence the feature of apricot. It is acknowledged this is a shape-shifting perfume, which can present some nuances differently over many applications and settings. Perhaps like the nocturnal scented Datura, it should be worn at night?  Minus UV, it may take on its Noir and shut out the images of the beach. It certainly has some polarising effects and the sum of its parts, particularly coconut, indolic Tuberose and Heliotrope play dough, make for profoundly loud distraction to its overall concept. Serge Lutens is such an artist in perfumery, I knew he was trying to portray something in Datura Noir. Though it seems, like me, he needs to brush up on his Botany.', ""'Very indolic, so much so that it has a ham/ salty wet dog smell' hits the nail on the head.  This, as the quoted reviewer stated, is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it just makes the fragrance all the more interesting.  Heavily floral, salty all rounded up with creamy coconut and a delicious almond. Highly bizarre to say the least, but definitely interesting and wearable."", ""I wore this today for the first time and I'm totally mesmerized. It's such a beautiful fragrance. Distinctive and powerful. Lovely gourmand, indeed. I bought it a while ago and it didn't impress me. On the contrary. I found it aggressive at that time. Today I decided to try it (it was pretty cold) and I realized this is perfect for the cold season. I know that some consider this a summer fragrance, but for me, it would be death by intoxication. The cold weather really makes DN an excellent companion. Great staying power and sillage. Very expensive but totally worth it. My only complaint would be about the box; I keep my bottles in their original boxes and with SL, it's impossible to close the box because of the spraying mechanism and the cap. All my SL boxes are crooked but hey, I guess I can live with that."", '@Jondelour, Thanks so much! Please share the clarification if it comes. I LOVE Datura Noir as a fragrance in its own right. It\'s gorgeous and just my type with that tuberose and coconut Play Doh vibe. So wonderful. But it is not the scent of the Brugmansias and Daturas I grew up with and am growing old with. As mentioned below, that may be a good thing since these scents are a bit novel to say the least. Possibly they would not work in a fragrance. (No one I knew ever tripped on them, though.) I too wonder what inspired the name. Almost forgot - we also grew tuberoses, or as everyone called them ""funeral flowers."" They do not smell like brugs or datura. Tuberose blooms at night can fill a whole backyard with fragrance. Thanks!!', ""Datura Noir does not smell like datura blooms. It does not smell like the closely related but different blooms of the genus Brugmansia either. But it is a powerful tuberose lily coconut scent, very indolic, so indolic it almost has that ham/wet dog salty smell to it. I don't mean that in an uncomplimentary way - I get the same lunchmeat smell from Baiser Vole Essence and Carnal Flower. It's part of the full spectrum of rich, authentic tuberose or lily. Lily is part of this, don't care what the notes say. What surprises me about Datura Noir is the wallop of coconut. Smells like a Play Doh flower, very beautiful. If you dislike fragrances with the Play Doh note, steer clear. Not me, I use Demeter's Play Doh sometimes, so I love that aspect of Datura Noir.  Side note about name:  While I do love Datura Noir, part of me is annoyed that it does not smell like datura. My mother always grew datura, the purple kind where the blooms are white on the inside. They have a distinctive scent that would be complicated to reproduce because it's hard to separate the smell of the blooms from the smell of the leaves, and the leaves stink in a stinky vegetable way, like raw broccoli. Since the plants are vespertine, it's hard not to associate the smell with evening breezes. But if you grew up smelling these plants, you never forget the scent, more of an odor really. After reading that last paragraph I question my judgment for wanting a perfume that smells like datura. At any rate, Datura Noir definitely does not, but I love it.  Now if someone would only capture the scent of yellow brugmansias in full bloom on a humid morning before dawn...."", 'Finally I got my fb of Datura Noir. Love it madly. It makes me want to have more Lutens in my collection. It’s addictive, mesmerizing, intoxicating! I don’t think DN is a summer scent only, and I don’t get the suntun lotion a lot of you say. I find it more deep, and complex, definitely not as simple as I could think. I’m gonna buy another bottle, for sure ❤️', 'Separation by Edvard Munch 1896 ++++++++++++++', ""There is a really clever effect at play here. You could get distracted by the coconut, but it's one player in this deep interpretation of a narcotic floral. It does bring to mind Angel's trumpet, aka Datura, (which is actually morbidly psychoactive, very nightmarish effects I hear), not what we're channeling here but that deep, sharp sweet, light bitter green, hinting at sinister. Perhaps the dark vibe is how I feel smelling the immense, complex, drooping flowers, knowing they entice like a drug and cause death. It makes me wonder if you cannot tincture these flowers for Parfum and avoid the chemical compounds. Surely it would take the fragrance to another level if we avoided the gourmand ingredients, taking the wearer on a psychotropic, hallucinatory journey. Rather than a day at the beach as many of you are experiencing. I absolutely admire the craft here, it's a work of art to create an accord so cleverly accurate. Just be happy it only takes you to the beach."", 'On me it smells exactly like powdery cheap suntan lotion I dislike and becomes barely noticeable after...2 minutes of spraying it. I crave elegant complexity without being overpowering. This fragrance is not it and it definitely is not worth the full bottle money.', ""Aaah, the addictive aroma of suntan lotion. Summer... In other words: mainly tuberose (of the mellow, non-weird kind), coconut and touch of sweetness. Almond? Can't smell it. And on that note, is Serge Lutens being a troll about the datura? What in this perfume is even vaguely reminiscent of datura?? And why Datura NOIR???  I wear this a lot, guys. I generally hate summers, beaches and tanning, but whenever I wear Datura Noir I think I might someday become a toned, bronzed, god-like creature. For now, it makes me let my hair down and wear billowy clothes... Edit: about that almond: Datura Noir has started to move away from suntan lotion and towards those cute almond candies I ate as a child. So I retract my previous statement."", ""The first time I tried this it was gourmand and stunning, so I decided to purchase a bottle. I tried it on as soon as I got home and was totally taken aback by how different it was! Still, I gave it a go. I'm glad I let it ride out because while it was still different, it was absolutely beautiful. Sprays on as a cold, almost metallic tuberose and then continues on in the same fashion but with a bit of jasmine and musk working it's way in. This time, I get almost no almond, myrrh or vanilla. So while it's not the same scent I fell in love with, I've fallen in love with this in a completely different way. I'm so very confused by how something can change so much on my skin! I tried it both times in winter, within a week from one another but wow! I can't wait to try this in different seasons, it obviously changes quite a lot based on things as small as body temp or maybe even mood! What a shifter. Very elegant, made me feel very lovely."", ""I don't do signature scents, yet, since I received this from a subscription, I have worn little else. Heady, enchanting and intoxicating, I wish I HAD worn it when I pick something else. Like a playboy finally falling in love, I think of no others for some reason.

I\'ll give it another chance but if I don\'t get more from it at that point I\'ll put it up on my swap list.

I have grown 12 different species of Datura, and this perfume resembles none of them even remotely.

(P.S.- the guest reviewer below is me)"", ""Datura Noir was one of my first niche perfumes and the second one I bought from Serge Lutens, sometime around 2004. I'm writing from memory as this perfume taught me an important lesson: Don't judge a scent until you've tried it in different seasons.  After I bought this I found that it was either too heavy or cloying, and rarely wore it, so my bottle remained nearly full. Years later, I was pleasantly surprised when I applied it during a rare Seattle summer night in the 70s. It was intoxicating and I felt like I finally understood this scent composition. Ever since my lesson, I think of Datura Noir as a summer night scent.  It's heavy on the scent of white flowers and it's sweet, that's pretty much all I can recall. So glad I still have half a bottle of this as it will probably last me another 10 years."", 'A powdery datura scent with toasted almond and lemon blossom. The datura scent reminds me a bit of a lily without the sweetness - it has the powdery delicacy of heliotrope and the indole of the tuberose without smelling exactly like either. This scent is very blended, and seems to be a soft cream white color (despite not smelling creamy to my nose). The almond and coconut add a pleasing toasted nuttiness. It\'s a bit dry, and actually not very sweet on me. The osmanthus adds a waxy, apricot-and-indole scent. Overall, this scent is a bit hard for me to parse - I\'m not sure what I feel about it. I like the smell, but I\'m not sure it\'s something I\'d wear or that it\'s very ""me"".', 'I first tried this in the warm, humid months because it seemed, judging by the notes, to be a good summer scent, but I was left a bit underwhelmed. I figured I would use it a bit for a couple of summers then either sell or gift it. Fast forward 6 months and we’ve just had the first snow of the season tonight and for whatever reason, I decided to spray a little... and it is absolutely, utterly divine! So many facets of the notes are shining out and I can’t believe this is the same fragrance I was so disappointed with just a few months ago! What was a loud, muddled mess in the summer has crystallized in the dry, cold season. Another valuable lesson learned- before giving up on a scent, try it in all seasons!', ""I used to ride my bike around town at night, and in one park there were huge datura inoxia bushes, their beguiling white trumpets spilling out this luscious narcotic lemon meringue-meets-lilacs fragrance for those brave enough to be there after dark with just the old ghosts for company.  This isn't quite it, but it is oh-so-close. It is soft, sweet, the sort of scent that doesn't so much grab you as it does gently draw you in. Like a violet, I can't quite tell what it smells like until I smell it, it's there, then gone if you try to look directly at it or pin it down.

This smells somewhat cheap and nauseating on me, unfortunately."", ""Now that I have a better idea of what datura flower smells like I agree this does smell like it. But unfortunately it does not work out on my skin. It starts out powdery sweet and creamy, reminding me a little of the original hypnotic poison. But as it warms on my skin and unpleasant floral note ruins it all. Possibly the osmanthus or lemon blossom. And not just that a strong playdo smell comes along, taking me right back to primary school.  I suggest trying it on your skin before buying a full bottle.

It's sugary sweet and creamy. Really nice. White floral starts out really strong but mellows after about 10-15 mins (and I mean strong enough that if you're generally tuberose adverse you'll probably feel fear, F-E-A-R, during those first few mins that it's not going to calm down) then gets even sweeter/sugary and the more buttery/coconut notes come out and has moderate to low sillage for about 5 or 6 hours. It lasts 8+ hours but after the first 5 or so it's just a skin scent."", ""I have no idea how a real datura smells like, but Datura Noir smells like some abstract poisonous and unpleasant flower to my nose.

I get coconut and anis with a tad of almond. This smells like a cross between Cacharel Loulou and Nivea sunscreen. I was really hoping for more almond and less coconut because I'm not a fan of sunscreen fragrances, but still it's a far cry from Banana Boat. Nice for a summer day, or a day you're missing summer. As I already have Maison Martin Margiela Beach Walk and Cacharel Loulou, I may not get a lot of wear out of this one, but we'll see. Edit: After a couple of days of wear, I think this perfume is a bit of a mess to be honest. The opening notes are strong and jumbled and by the time the perfume settles enough and evens out, it's so faint it's almost a skin scent. Definitely try before you buy. Edit 2: okay, what the heck?

This is certainly no sugar cookie almond. The weird combination of notes is kind of trippy, just like a datura plant lol. Datura Noir is the definition of intoxicating, but it's a natural kind of intoxicating. It's such a feel good scent in a trippy, heady, intoxicating way, mmmm."", 'I love this fragrance so much. I was a bit vary about it since tuberose perfumes tend to go too florid on my skin (especially if they also contain vanilla), but this is wonderful. It almost smells like a bit toned down, even a bit greener tuberose if that is possible. It is probably the combined effect of the powdery touch of heliotrope and the creaminess of coconut and almonds and the fresh scent of lemon blossom, although the latter goes away after a while. I think the heliotrope, coconut and almonds bring out a facet of tuberose that is not too often emphasized, a comforting creaminess. I cannot stop smelling my wrist where I sprayed this lovely scent.

I got none of the beautiful white florals everyone spoke of, and I was so disappointed since my favorite note on the planet is tuberose. It went straight to the cabinet, all the way in the back, never to be touched again.  Recently I was discussing a few of my perfumes with my husband, and we just stood there with cabinet doors opened. He reached for the Datura Noir box and asked me why I never wear it, to which I replied that it was sour and not my kind of white floral fume. He sprayed one spray onto his hand, called me crazy, and walked out, but he left this awesome sweet, pungent aroma trail behind him. I went ahead and did one spray on my neck, figuring I can always shower, but to my surprise, this turned out to be one of my best tuberose perfumes, and if it wasn't for my husband, I would've never known. There is just something special about Datura Noir that I can not pinpoint. It's different than most of the tuberose perfumes I own or I've tried. Sweet and slightly pungent, appropriate for both summer and winter. I wore it in over 100-degree temps and it performed beautifully. It seems that heat accentuates the tuberose and pulls it to the top, which is lucky for me since I am a complete tuberose nut. I recently learned how to date Serge Lutens bottles and my bottle is from July 2011. I don't know how is the performance with the newer bottles, probably not the same, but my Datura Noir lasted about 10-12 hours each time I wore it. I put it back in the cabinet to be used on special occasions until I can find another vintage bottle of it as a backup."", 'See, there\'s this trinity of fragrances: SL Datura Noir, TF Soleil Blanc, and Dior Hypnotic Poison EDT. They are all so reminiscent of each other, they have the same coconut-tuberose foundation but are suitable for different seasons. The TF is strong (""thick"" might be a better word), outgoing, and great for summer and the beach with citruses mixed in. Dior HP is the winter version, sweeter, basically coconut and root beer. SL Datura Noir is somewhere in the middle, the most white-floral of the trinity, good for all seasons and much more delicately beautiful. She\'s elegant, more soft-spoken than the extrovert TF Soleil Blanc or seductive Dior HP. It might be redundant to own all three, but I do and I love them.  The projection on Datura Noir is just right, not a screamer but its strength is reflective of the elegant mood of the perfume. Unfortunately, it also turns a bit odd and sour on my skin later on the dry-down, it\'s definitely green on me, I will need to test this more...', ""A previous reviewer called Datura Noir a tropical oriental, and I firmly believe that description's spot-on. Juicy coconut and heady tuberose combine in a thick, luscious harmony that never veers into the suntan lotion smell that coconut tends to create. Almond and tonka prop up the fragrance, adding just enough sweetness to add a bit of lightness without it Datura Noir going gourmand. Despite all these heavy notes Datura Noir never goes headache-inducing, which I suspect is coming from the lemon flower in just the right proportions giving a bit of freshness to an otherwise heady perfume. Datura Noir would be the perfect spring/summer oriental for those who normally love heavy hitters but don't want to bowl people over with their perfume when the weather is hot and humid."", 'Datura Noir has been on my want list since June so I was delighted to receive a bottle of it for Christmas.  I have grown both datura and brugmansia and much as I usually love white flowers, I couldn\'t handle either of them. The brugmansia ended up at the bottom of our property as that was as near as I could stand it. I would not say that datura is present in this frag. As I am learning with the floral frags, it is more the idea of a flower than trying to replicate a specific flower.  Parts of the datura are poisonous/hallucinogenic. Uncle Serge\'s descriptions of his fragrances are often quite ""trippy"" so it makes a bit of sense to me, his reference to this flower. It is about as logical as any of the other names of his frags. As for the fragrance itself, the first few moments have a little coconut going on, then it is floral - all sorts of sweet flowers. Tracking this scent is like trying to catch a butterfly. It lands on one sweet thing in the garden, flutters about and is then on to the next thing. I am reluctant to catch this beautiful butterfly and pin it down, but if I have to.......... Datura Noir lands on heliotrope, mock orange, phlox, and buddleja, but is grounded for a bit of a rest, thanks to the musk and vanilla. Yes, a beautiful butterfly. Edit Jan 16/ I wear a perfume everyday but rarely do I receive comments, good or bad. Datura Noir has received many compliments. Edit May 16/ It has been almost a year since I first smelt DN and I realize the memory most linked to this fragrance is being in Portland. It was a very warm night in June, we were waiting for a table at Pok Pok, so went over to their bar on the other side of the street - The Whiskey Soda Lounge. I had a ""mango alexander"" for a cocktail, which was heaven. ( The ingredients I can remember were mango,alcohol and coconut cream.) Datura Noir was on my arms and the drink smelt so good....... It was a lovely evening, now captured forever in a bottle of scent.', 'If this was poisonous then I’d be in real trouble because I want to eat it and roll around in it. It’s absolutely delicious! I love marzipan, coconut, vanilla, and white flowers so I’m a sucker for this. What struck me first is the smell of almonds and I immediately went to thoughts of marzipan. Marzipan is the only candy I could eat until I get sick. The coconut and vanilla are very subdued and not cloying at all but have the SL fresh touch. The tuberose goes so well with these other fleshy notes. The apricots, myrrh, and osmanthus give it a subtle blast of herbal menthol which surprisingly give it nice balance and weight for the more prominent floral and creamy sweet notes to sing. How does SL do these strange medicinal notes so well? SL seem to be the blackbelts of balance. It’s not too sweet or too medicinal or too loud or powdery, too fruity, or sharp or bright. It’s another Goldie Locks from SL in that it’s just right. The real stand outs are the almond, vanilla, osmanthus, myrrh, and the tuberose to me. If you love almond, tuberose, and don’t mind osmanthus (or like it) then buy it! Don’t hesitate you need this fragrance in your life.  Other people have noted that the sillage is fantastic in this one. Unfortunately, for me it happens to be the opposite. My skin just devours some fragrances and this one is no exception. It’s almost like my body wants to eat and absorb everything I love. Lol This fragrance is friendly, gentle to the point of being baby like. Something about it reminds me of when my little boy was a baby in diapers. Very sun tan lotion, lactonic, smooth, and whispers of gourmand on me. I ddn’t even think that I liked gourmand fragrances. I can tell this is going to be one of those fragrances that pulls me into a new fragrance genre. Someone should make a marzipan dessert based on this fragrance. I’m falling in love with Serge Lutens. I wish I could own every single fragrance in this house. I feel like I have perfumes I love, but then there are perfumes that are incandescent soulmates. This and SL A La Nuit are both my soulmates.  Update: I wore this again today and the longevity was about 5 hours so immediately bought a full bottle of this. I’ll just wear a lot of it when I apply it! I couldn’t resist this one. It’s just too beautiful not to own. My full bottle came today and it seems way stronger! It’s got way better sillage and longevity than the sample I got. I’m thrilled with this fragrance. It’s the most beautiful fragrance I’ve smelled in years.', ""If you were a child of the 90's like me, there are a few ubiquitous things that frame your childhood: Furbies, stirrup pants, Tamagotchis, the golden age of Nickelodeon. Hours roaming the neighborhood unattended, listening to Mambo No. 5 on your swanky portable CD player without giving the lyrics a second thought. It was a simpler time, as childhoods are, filled with those things that scents in particular bring back en force. Do you remember those scented markers? I sure do, because Datura Noir smells exactly like the blueberry one.  It's not a bad perfume. If I didn't have this association I might even like it. If I concentrate, I can get a little vanilla, a little musk, a little osmanthus. But the wafts of synthetic blueberry come screaming off of my skin and drench every note in horrible scented marker accord. I cannot get past it, and I don't think I ever will.  I'll pass my decant to someone else and hope that their skin chemistry is wildly different than mine."", ""This is FRAUD!!! There's no trace of datura, nor anything noir. Instead, it's a gourmand of light to medium weight, dominated by a notable presence of tuberose. It begins with an undercurrent of slightly bitter almond, which has a hint of booziness to it. From the outset, the tuberose is there, lurking behind the almond. As it progresses, this silky tuberose, along with a mix of other sweeter florals, takes center stage, complemented by a delightful, higher-toned creamy coconut note. Gradually, more substantial gourmand facets like heliotrope, vanilla, and tonka emerge from the base, gaining prominence at certain points, only for the fragrance to eventually settle into a harmonious blend of smooth tuberose, with only a touch of gourmands left. The perfect word to describe this perfume is 'smooth'— smoother than liquid milk."", 'Datura Noir was released in 2001 and its name means ""Black Datura"". But what is Datura? Datura is a poisonous flower, also known as Devil\'s Trumpet, Jimson weed, Devil\'s fig, among other names. Not to be confused with another flower of the same family, which is called Angel’s Trumpet and belongs to species Brugmansia. All species of Datura (Stramonium, Brugmansia and Ceratocaulis) are poisonous, especially its seeds and its flowers, according to Wikipedia. Serge Lutens was inspired by the scent of Brugmansia and defends his idea as follows: ""Like a diabolic trail of smoke left by Satan in Paradise. Some say this fragrance will enthrall you; others that it will make you crazy. Others still that excessive exposure will kill you dead"". In front of this concept, there\'s no way to remain static, suffocating the latent curiosity about the fragrance. And the composition promises! It has notes of Mandarin orange and lemon flower, followed by notes of osmanthus, heliotrope, tuberose, vanilla, coconut oil and apricots, on a base of myrrh, bitter almond, musk and tonka beans. On the skin, the output is floral and narcotic. Some say that the scent of Datura is similar to the Lady-of-the-Night, here replaced by the Tuberose. Quickly, the scent begins to evolve and turns into a mix of vanilla and coconut, with nuances of apricots. It should be remembered that the osmanthus flower gives that nuance and on top of that, we also have the fruits in the composition. For some reason, during this phase, I remembered the smell of Ange ou Démon (Givenchy).  In the last stage of evolution, stands out the bitter of the almonds and nothing else. I feel neither the myrrh nor the musk. Some say that, after completely evolved, it reminds the perfume of Hypnotic Poison (Dior). As far as I remember, the latest exudes much more and has a delicious and warm vanilla. In General, the result was disappointing on my skin. I created much anticipation about the concept, but the fragrance does not fulfil its role. In addition, it loses projection in about 30 minutes, turning into a semi-gourmand with some nuances of flowers and apricots. It has great longevity, but stays close to the skin. Datura Noir deserved to be one of those perfumes that almost do not evolve and exhale for hours. If the output remained longer, it would be much better. Unfortunately, the fragrance gets lost between the coconut and vanilla and what\'s left is a scent of cookies being baked on a tropical island. Meanwhile, I remain curious to know what it would be the diabolic trail of smoke left by Satan in Paradise.', ""This is basically Carnal Flower with some coconut and creaminess added. If you love tuberose you'll probably love this."", ""Tuberose is tricky. In Serge Lutens DATURA NOIR, it is very, very thick, in large part, I believe, due to the marked coconut note. Coconut is also tricky, and tends to overwhelm in more than minuscule doses. To my nose, this combination of tuberose and coconut is simply too heavy-handed. I love the tuberose in FRACAS and CARNAL FLOWER, but combined with the coconut cream in this composition, it seems dense and impenetrable, like a blob of, well, yes, I hate to admit it: suntan lotion!  My objection to this scent is not grounded in a general abhorrence of tropical tuberose compositions. Believe it or not, I number among the tiny faction of true believers in and fervent devotees of Guerlain MAHORA. Why do I regard MAHORA as a masterpiece (Guerlain's final chef-d'oeuvre, may that once illustrious house rest in peace...) and DATURA NOIR as something of a flop? Perhaps it is the sheer weight of the later which drags it down, preventing any significant development on my skin. MAHORA, in contrast, unfurls in delightful layers over the course of its trajectory from opening to drydown. I truly love MAHORA (which many people detest), and yet I would never wear DATURA NOIR, even if I had a bottle lying around. I have seen no comparisons by anyone of DATURA NOIR to MAHORA but would be very interested to know what those who adore DATURA NOIR think of the Guerlain perfume (launched in 2000, one year before SL DN...). My suspicion is that anyone who loves DATURA NOIR would also love MAHORA, though I obviously serve as a refutation of the converse claim! (-: And it seems pretty clear to me that anyone who hates MAHORA is unlikely to think highly of DATURA NOIR. The moral of this story: no one who lacks infinite liquid assets should buy niche perfume scent unsniffed!""]"

Ambre 114 was launched in 2001. Ambre 114 was created by Gerald Ghislain, Magali Senequier and Sylvie Jourdet. Top notes are Nutmeg and Thyme; middle notes are Patchouli, Sandalwood, Rose, Geranium, Cedar and Vetiver; base notes are Amber, Vanilla, Benzoin, Tonka Bean and Musk.

It opens very heavy on the amber with notes of wood that is very reminiscent of the oud (or other wood) perfumes that would waft around in a mosque. Over time, it dries down into this sweet and powdery amber that feels confectionary, almost like the layer of powder that coats marshmallows to keep them from sticking to each other. I enjoy this sweetness and find that it pairs really well with the amber. The other listed notes notes are completely lost on my nose, it's fully an amber, wood, and sugar scent to me. It lasts quite a long time on my skin, maybe around 8-10 hours."", ""Supposedly there are 114 elements that go into an amber per the press blurb for Ambre 114. There must be an error in translation because in 2001 and prior, when Ambre 114 was launched, there were not 114 elements on the periodic table. Of the less than 114 that were on the table I highly doubt some are included in ambers (e.g. the lanthanides, actinides). Also, there isn't a standard formulation for an amber, as far as I'm aware, so saying there is a 114 of anything in every amber perfume is misleading at best. All of this aside and thinking of the key point to be made, what we call an amber accord is very complex and multifaceted. There is a reason why it's been the darling of perfumery for an age, not the least being because it's cheap to make and it lasts for a long time on skin (making the consumer feel like they're getting better value out of every spray). It's hard to say anything new about ambers, from the perfumer's perspective. So, does the tag-team of Gerald Ghislain and Sylvie Jourdet reinvent this wheel that has been rolling over us for the better part of a century? Nope, not at all. But what it does do is convince me that if I were going to learn the science and techniques behind modern perfumery in an attempt to become a perfumer myself, I would want to learn from Sylvie Jourdet.  Ms. Jourdet is a professor at ISIPCA and the University of Montpellier, in addition to composing perfumes for numerous brands including Histoires. Having experienced numerous Histoires perfumes, it's Ms. Jourdet's take on amber that convinces me of her talent, knowledge, and especially her clarity of thought and process in composition. The creativity that goes into her compositions varies, but the execution is always textbook - true to her calling as an educator and a consistent guiding light to the novice or the floundering. Just like a mathematics professor working through a proof on a blackboard, or a chemistry professor working through a formula in a lab, there is a consistency, accuracy, precision, and deftness to Ms. Jourdet's compositions.  Though Ambre 114 does not present us with anything new in the amber genre, I cannot say that it is anything less than superbly executed. Every single note is in the right place, speaks at the right volume, times its dry down perfectly to the coordinated evolution of the perfume (or the story, as Histoires would prefer to put it), and the materials are of excellent quality for the purpose of the composition. There are herbs and fresh seed spices keeping the top bright and energetic; florals, patchouli, woods, and vetiver in the heart give it body, structure, and complexity through soft and powdery flowers, spicy and earthy tones, and refined and sophisticated woods in the form of resins and smooth smoke; in the base vanilla, tonka bean, and benzoin, give us amber's burnished glow through warmth, pleasant and not-overwhelming vanilla sweetness, baking spices, and balsams. This is the template for an amber, and what Histoires have done is put a high-quality form of that template in a bottle for us to reference at any given time. If any of you reading this have read other reviews of mine you know that I am worn-out on and tired of ambers, their overuse and all-too-frequent poor quality continue to push the genre further and further down my preferences list. But even I, disillusioned pessimist that I am, have to admit that this is a stellar amber."", 'I wear many of my lovely, vanilla-centric, gourmand fragrances at bedtime as (sorta) aromatherapy. I\'m going through a rough spell. I find certain fragrances help me sleep, help me remain asleep. I was feeling ill and very nauseous the other night. I couldn\'t bear the thought of spraying an uber-sweet, sticky, vanilla gourmand. I thought, ""I would love a full, pure, dense, natural, lovely amber-centric, amber based fragrance."" Nothing more, nothing less. So, I purchased Profumum Roma ""Ambra Aurea"" and Histoires de Parfums ""Ambre 114."" I do not feel knowledgable enough about amber-centric perfumes for my review to hold much weight. I know very little about amber fragrances. Any amber based fragrances I ever tried were worn way in the past, like nearly a decade back. I always thought amber perfumes performed very masculine on my skin. With this said, I own and love Chanel ""Coromandel."" I also own and love By Kilian ""Incense Oud."" Histories de Parfums ""Ambre 114"" is lovely, it really is. And while I ""like"" both Ambra Aurea and Ambre 114, I\'ve grown to LOVE Ambra Aurea, not so much with Ambre 114. Ambre 114 opens in a discernibly lighter, less dense, less thick way than Ambra Aurea. The perfume opens with smooth, ethereal, comforting wood-based notes. I imagine some evident spiciness in the opening. However, within minutes, the perfume develops with the loveliest mixture of gentle florals, light woody accords and a dusty, powdery dryness.  In about 15-30 minutes, the landing is floral, amber, vanilla and musk. There is a barely discernible bitterness, or sharpness due to the tonka beans. The overall blend of the multiple listed notes is perfection, IMHO. The additional floral, patchouli and mixed-woods notes add interest and intrigue to the fragrance\'s development on skin. Duration and silage are moderate. Ambre 114 is not syrupy, or boozy, nor is it thick, or dense. Ambre 114 is dusty, arid, very dry and slightly powdery. I DEFINITELY feel Ambre 114 leans a wee-bit more feminine than Ambra Aurea. I like Ambre 114 but I really adore Ambra Aurea.', ""Mouai , très moyen , un ambré doux , tres leger discret, projection et sillage minimaliste , de meme pour la tenue. Vous prenez Ambre sultan de Serge Lutens et vous le diluez avec 4 fois plus d'alcool. Voila ce qu'est Ambre 114 Ils ont mit beaucoup trop d'alcool dedans , à l'ouverture on a meme l'impression que c'est un parfum bon marché... Je ne retrouve pas la 'qualité de niche ' qu'il devrait y avoir ."", 'Don\'t you love a fragrance where, it\'s so well blended that it\'s hard to pick out the individual notes? Well, that\'s this one!  A spicy amber, woody fragrance, suitable for both sexes. The rose and vanilla are so well blended, it just smells ""really good"". What makes me love this is the vetiver..rose, vanilla and vetiver is a winning combination. Being truly unisex, this one is a really great ""his and hers"" scent, a good one to share with a partner. You will both smell awesome but not the same, as chemistry pulls different notes. It was more spicy on my guy than myself, where it dried down warm and smooth, like a cozy sweater on a cool day.  My only criticism is that it doesn\'t last long...it becomes a skin scent quickly on me. And that\'s sad for me because this one has such an inviting drydown.  Smells a lot like L\'eau D\'Ambre Extreme by L\'Artisan Parfums. Which I love but it\'s hard to get in the States.  Not sure if I will pop for an FB. The lack of performance is holding me back.', 'Anyone wondering about the comparisons to Montale Blue Amber, this one is like you just put on a luxury perfumed body lotion and are curling up in a cashmere blanket/sweater and maybe just made cookies, Blue Amber is almost more old Hollywood vibes, big fur coat, cigarette smoking, diamonds and pearls. This one is slightly easier to wear but also slightly more non descript. If i had to get a bottle I think I’d go for Montale’s Blue Amber, it just says more. This is nice though.', ""The opening is very nutty, aromatic mixed with some amber and faintly, some vanilla. It evolves into a smooth amber vanilla combination, it has a really subtle resinous sweetness to it that i really enjoy. It has pretty good longevity and performance. I personally really enjoy this but i understand it's not for everyone. Imo it's a really unique but easy to understand fragrance with good performance and longevity."", ""Spicy dry opening, the kind that is so dry it makes you want to sneeze. Some old school masculine aromatic/chypre vibes to it too for about 10-15 minutes, then it starts to go in this more bubblegum vanillic resinous realm. It doesn't really feel balanced as much as I like everything that's in here. There's something missing about it. Most of what you get is powdery vanilla and synthetic smelling sandalwood and patchouli, so it reminds me a bit too much of modern designer scents. If you added some fruit to this it would lose all its magic and fit in well on a Sephora shelf. Not that there's something wrong with that at all, but this is one of those I'd wear if someone gifted it to me but I wouldn't pay for."", 'One of the worst amber perfumes', ""An easy to reach for amber fragrance that's enjoyable."", 'I do not smell the vanilla, the rose, or the tonka ; only amber and wood. This is very ambery on my skin, my boyfriend loves it and said I smell amazing. It opens slightly citrusy, but it is only slightly sweet. To me this is perfectly unisex. Very nice, might be FBW depending on the wear. It is around 190EU for 120ml which is very reasonable, but might get a bigger decant for now !', 'Ambre 114 by Histoires de Parfums is a beautifully crafted amber fragrance that strikes a perfect balance between warmth and sophistication. The scent opens with a blend of spicy notes like nutmeg and cinnamon, creating a cozy, slightly exotic introduction. The heart reveals a smooth combination of vanilla and tonka bean, complemented by the resinous depth of benzoin and patchouli, which enhance its warmth and sweetness without being cloying. The amber base is rich and enveloping, yet remains refined, making it ideal for cooler weather or evening wear. Ambre 114 has moderate projection and longevity, leaning closer to a skin scent after a few hours. It’s a timeless, versatile fragrance that appeals to amber lovers and those seeking a comforting, elegant scent.', 'really sweet and powdery celebration of resins. i feel so chic when i wear this. i feel like a fashionable archaeologist or some academic but cool job like that. carried lots by the vanilla-tonka notes but the warmth of the amber really pushes through that. love her!!', 'You dry some bottles with a sense of relief, others with regret. This is the second case. It was a pleasure, thank you, HdP!', 'The notes list is overly optimistic. Funk, Amber, patchouli. In that order. Dries down to a powdery, funky, vanilla. It’s nice but a little meh. If you like this try Xerjoff Empiryan. It does what this does only much, much better. The performance blows this out of the water and it is more patchouli foreword and the funk is toned down.', 'Season: autumn, winter and early spring. Occasion: relaxed events, brunches, lunches, dinners, social drinks. Nutmeg, vanilla, amber and musk are the work horses of this gourmand fragrance. Balsamic and tonka scents rise up quickly and remain constant. Its sillage doesn’t project far, so may not suit those who prefer to be smelt before they’re seen. Masterfully blended.', 'Lovely vanilla amber that comes off as quite cakey, unfortunately it becomes more boring in the drydown. Mediocre performance', 'Growing up in suburban Chicago, I had a best friend whose mother wore only Guerlain Shalimar. She was a well-to-do woman, with red colored hair, always kept in an early 1960s style. She drove a gold Cadillac DeVille convertible which she used to drive to her daily amusements: the racetrack, the shopping center, lunching with her girlfriends. She kept a large bottle of Smirnoff\'s Vodka in the wood paneled den which was dispensed with a pump, and she refreshed herself with it every night around 5pm. She smoked Carlton cigarettes which she bought by the carton. Meals were basic: lamb chops with mint jelly, salad with thousand island dressing, chocolate ice cream.  They had two servants: a man who lived the basement and watered the birdbath and took care of outside things; and another lady from Jamaica who was the maid.  They were wealthy people because they had two Cadillacs, a two car garage with an electric door opener, a 25"" color television, air conditioning, and an above ground swimming pool.  But the husband and wife did not get along. He slept in his own room and kept a little bag of chocolates in the top drawer of his dresser. He was very strict with my friend and forbid her from closing the bedroom door when I played games or dolls with her.  Years later it was revealed that he had a mistress on the south side of Chicago. And his wife had been married four times and when she was young was quite well known around Chicago area nightclubs for her record producing success with jazz musicians. All this is something that comes back to me when I spray Ambre 114. It truly smells like Shalimar reincarnated.', 'Ambre 114 is my first scent to try from Histoires de Parfums. HdP is one of the earlier niche houses, and each perfume is inspired by a notable person/character of their era, the era itself or similar. Having said that, Ambre 114 deviates from this formula. It is an amber scent (obviously), and the ""114"" of its name apparently refers to the number of ingredients used, Le Labo-style. It is a pleasant vanilla-amber scent, sweet and lightly spiced with some herbal nuances. My favourite sweet amber scent is Amouage Material, and I find most others unnecessary as a result. Still, A114 is a pleasant, good-quality example of the genre, nicely-balanced and lightweight. The herbal notes add interest.  A114 is amber-dominant from initial spray, smooth, balsamic and just the right amount of sweet. The nutmeg is quite prominent initially, adding its typical warm, biscuit-y spice to the amber. I get tonka bean up top, its balsamic smoothness adding body to the amber accord and its sweet spice enhancing the aromatic accord. As it develops, the herbal notes punctuate the sweet amber accord nicely, with their aromatic greenness complementing the amber while adding a contrast. I get peppery geranium initially, with a prominent patchouli note adding earthiness as it develops. Some powdery rose follows, complemented beautifully by the patchouli, amber and spices. Soft woods emerge as it progresses further, grounding things but remaining in the background. The amber accord is front-and-centre throughout, with powdery vanilla coming to the fore in the later stages, adding dry, smooth sweetness, complementing the amber to perfection. It becomes softly musky as it fades, remaining a vanilla-amber scent until final fade. Sillage and longevity are moderate. It is a unisex, autumn/winter scent. A lightweight, nicely-composed sweet amber with points of interest, A114 exceeded my expectations. Satisfying throughout, it is an approachable, good-quality amber scent; understated, elegant and very wearable. 4/5.', 'Can anyone explain why I can’t smell this perfume at all?', 'I really enjoy this one.

It opens with a kiss of fresh powdered nutmeg. The amber and vanilla quickly rise to greet the nose but the caramel sweetness is held at bay by the delightful dance of spice. As the fragrance settles on the skin, the rose and geranium start blooming, leading us into a wonderful floral direction. This is supported by a fragrant, almost liqueur-like backbone of cedar and sandalwood. The patchouli and vetiver are not especially prominent to my nose but blend together to add a lightly herbal, aromatic edge.  The dry down is especially gorgeous as the amber and vanilla come into their own, deepened by nutty tonka and pillowy musk. The rose still lingers while spices and balsamic shimmers softly dot the landscape.  If you're a fan of Grand Soir you are pretty much guaranteed to fall in love with this gorgeous scent which builds on that amber-vanilla structure and adds in many more layers.

So I had to be careful not to wear it around him. I recently bought a new decant, and I'm shocked at the change in projection. I don't get even half of the strength I once got. I can spray 5 or 6 sprays with no comment from my husband, and it doesn't come off strong to me at all. (Even in the hot summer.)

This is my 3rd encounter with HdP (the other two are 1740 and Veni, both of which I am obsessed with) and they haven't given me a dud yet."", 'I sometimes wonder if we expect too much, with different phases and notes coming through, a sort of olfactory journey, beast mode, laadeeda. Well this is pretty linear, with decent performance and longevity, the amber is absolutely there alright but somehow still understated and smooth. Regards comparators, its like Chergui (which is sweeter) or Amber Sultan (thicker), does a similar job to either, but I prefer it to both. Histoires also sell in 15ml bottles, another plus. There are so many ambers out there, to me this is just very very good in this genre of perfume, and I like it a lot. 4/5', 'This is a strong amber, patchouli and vanilla smell.

Found it sweet and somewhat floral, like eating a candy made with brown sugar in a flower shop. Later it becomes more like a spiced cream soda (with the amber and wood buzzing underneath) which I liked though it made me a little hungry.

If you like a mix of sweet and spicy, I'd suggest trying this one."", 'The ambre 114 starts with strong repelling hit of patchouli, amber and benzoin.

Few minutes later and Gradually the vanilla note starts to show up in unusual way and it’s very enjoyable to trace it.

Might get this after I run out of the Brecourt amber one."", 'Nice amber but I prefer less nice scents. If you like an amber that wont offense anyone, this is your amber. Vanilla, amber and tonka. I would have prefered more resins and incense in this amber to weigh up the sweet vanilla. Mediocre, not fbw.', ""I found this amber nice but boring and undistinctive. Others have detailed the scent notes of vanilla, buttery wood, faint spices. I get no floral notes.

I find this to be an above average unisex amber/benzoin/vanilla fragrance with nice longevity and projection.

They're not memories, exactly, but the zeitgeist of a certain time in my life, like a collection of quickly jotted notes and trinkets I find at my mother's house. Ambre 114 is a friend's dad I crushed hard on in high school, along with the myriad feelings that come with that 13-year-old can of worms. I can't remember which dad it was (which might say more than I should admit about myself), but the feelings surrounding him, the butterflies and weird guilt, are so real that it feels like I'm 18 again. This scent gives me a kind of nervous energy, like I'm waiting to go hang out with my friend, if only to catch a glimpse of the salt-and-pepper wonder of a man who happened to live there, too. This is a strong perfume with exceptional sillage. With only two sprays, I keep getting wafts of warm amber and resin, jammy rose, and a sweet medicinal hint of benzoin for hours. It leans masculine for me, but not overly so – maybe worn by the kind of man who occasionally puts a flower behind his ear and wears pink shirts without thinking too hard about it – but this might be because of my associated memories. The rose and vanilla notes balance the masculinity nicely, and I can see myself wearing it in the fall and winter, maybe even a rainy day in the spring. It's a cozy, sultry scent, slightly mysterious and self-assured, with an undercurrent of mature sexuality.  But that might just be my daddy issues talking. *shrugs in teenage hormones* The most interesting thing is that is smells markedly different on my husband – more spice and wood, less vanilla and rose. It doesn't bring the same kind of feeling to me when he wears it, so I'll just continue using it on myself, reliving those fondly confusing memories of being a naive teenager in love."", 'Is this a warm, smooth, soft, cozy, vanillic amber scent with some nice floral nuances? Yes, absolutely. However, I also feel like it\'s a bit too ""perfumey"", traditional and formal for my personal taste. If you don\'t mind that aspect, then I can totally see how you would class this as a perfect amber fragrance, because it definitely is really good. For me, though, when it comes to pure amber fragrances I prefer Profumum Roma\'s Ambra Aurea. They both have many of the same qualities and are both excellent amber fragrances, but Ambra Aurea to me feels more raw and natural, more straight-forward and less ""perfumey"", and I for one definitely prefer that in a fragrance.', 'This review is based upon a sample from Lucky Scent. Ambre 114....I opened it up, and immediately fell in love with the smooth, warm, amber notes, and just a touch of labdanum, that diaper creme note that is evident in the undertone of Ambre 114.  It has all the warm, happy, enveloping notes I love: amber, vanilla, benzoin, sandalwood, tonka bean, musk. Some herbal/flowery, light touches of geranium, thyme, rose. The flowers and herbs help sober up the very powdery predominate of Ambre 114.  It does not strike me as gendered at all. It might, however, be preferable in cooler weather as the notes are very cozy and warm. And this bottle, which LS was offering at $89 at for 60 ML costs less than half of what it is smells most nearly like: Papillon Bengale Rouge ($190 for 50 ML) which also contains notes of: honey, vanilla, tonka bean, benzoin, labdanum, rose and sandalwood. I find Ambre 114 to be less strong, but just as effective. Bengale Rouge is almost too much. My partner was offended by it, and made me wash it off. But Ambre 114 is subtle, just strong enough to please.  And truly a great bargain for such a fine perfume.', 'THIS IS A TOP 5 AMBER! Such an Amazing Amber Fragrance MAN! It starts Herbal! Reisinous! Vanillic!  The thing i love mostly about this is the constant evolution! And the small nuances here and there! It reminds me of those small shops selling Herbs here in Greece! Its so Aromatic!  Yet  Vanillic! Sticky! Reisinous! This is a top 5 Amber for me right now! All im Saying is! Sample it! And you will soon want to purchase the thing! 10/10', ""Half way through my 4th bottle and, so far, the best amber fragrance I've tried (and have purchased). Upon spraying, you'll get a strong smack of spices, especially nutmeg, cardamon, and a tad of cinnamon. After 15 minutes or so, I started noticing the middles notes mentioned in the description (especially geranium and pachouli. The latter one not as strong). The dry down is pure ecstasy. An everlasting veil of fantastic amber that you will not want to scrub off plus a hint of musk that's barely detectable, unless your nose is as sharp as a bloodhound (like mine)."", 'I received 114 ambre today in the mail. My initial thoughts were this is so dated. To my nose it’s almost identical to vintage opium for women. Not a safe blind buy if you’re into modern everyday perfumes. But it’s definitely a good quality fragrance.', 'Very sublte, simple amber fragrance. I prefer ""Ambra Nobile"" from Nobile 1942, which is a very classy amber. Or ""L\'air du desert Marocain"" from Tauer, for a nice subtle woody/aromatic/amber fragrance', 'Well, I’d better get some more amber reviews out of the way before the spring is fully here and it gets too warm to wear them 😁 This is an easier amber than the two previous ones I reviewed, Ambre Sultan and Le Lion, but also more traditionally feminine. While Le Lion is to me completely unisex and Ambre Sultan almost leans masculine, this leans a little more towards a classic feminine amber. And where Ambre Sultan was simplicity perfected, this almost feels over-engineered. A very strong and very “perfumey” opening with sadly no smokiness quickly goes into a spicy amber concoction that feels strangely hollow. This is not a warm cozy amber where the raw materials get to shine, but more of a basic perfume, a musky patchouli sweetened by vanilla and tonka, that serves up the idea of amber as a genre. The dry down almost reminds me of Caron Pour un Homme, with the musky powdery vanilla. To me it’s an ok scent but nothing to write home about. The amber genre is vast so why settle for something like this?', ""I've tested a number of fragrances from this house and I've learned to prepare myself properly for a force to be reckoned with. I was especially cautious with this too, considering that it's an amber... I prepared myself to be bowled over with sweet resins, spices and vanilla but I am pleasantly surprised by how effortless and serene it feels. Perhaps it's the thyme and geranium that brings a lighter tone to the composition, it's quite fresh! Of all the ambers I've tried, I am seriously considering a full bottle purchase because I can see myself wearing this any time of year (on the right occasion). I think a good perfume takes a tried and true combination and tries to elevate it in some way, but the best perfumes carry a story and immediately invoke a deeper feeling. This bottle is definitely the former rather than the latter. At the end of the day this is an amber fragrance with a twist and what it lacks in originality it more than makes up for in wearability. I can imagine that this is a big money maker for HdP, very well done. 8.5/10"", 'I wish I could smell what everybody else is smelling but, alas, this smells like baby powder to me. Bummer.', ""I will start off by saying I generally am not a fan of amber - an unpopular opinion, it seems. Yet this fragrance is an exception. I was compelled to sample it after reading Luca Turin and Tania Sanchez's reviews, and have been happily surprised. It should have been a nightmare for me; I dislike jammy rose fragrances, lean away from powdery notes, and tend to dislike strong vanillas. This fragrance has all of those things, and yet I find I can't be mad at it.  The first few seconds are odd - the combination of vanilla, thyme, and nutmeg create an unusual accord that to my nose smells very much like hot metal, but it quickly fades into a mature powdery vanilla. My skin amplifies even the most miniscule powdery notes in fragrances, which tends to add a mature touch to almost everything I try - I have accepted that I will likely always smell like a grandma, but in this case, it's actually very nice, as it is underscored by a sweet rose. This fragrance walks the line between masculine and feminine, between sweet gourmand and creamy amber, often flickering between the two. Wearing this fragrance was an interesting experience, I find that I will have to reevaluate my preferences and be more open to trying scents that I have avoided in the past. The actual notes in this fragrance take a back seat to the journey that one takes while wearing it - it is almost playfully capricious, changing by the minute to reveal another facet or accord. Though I will likely not be purchasing a bottle, this fragrance should be appreciated for its masterful blending, it is truly a work of art."", ""Very intense sharp nutmeg opening, then a somewhat prickly sandalwood (I think). And the amber itself is not as warm and cozy as I'd like. It feels uninspired, an amber perfume made by someone who doesn't really like amber. And like a perfume you'd wear for others, as a fashion statement, rather than something intimate and enjoyable for oneself. Contrary to other reviews on here, NOT a safe blind buy, by a long shot!"", ""I received this as part of a perfume subscription. I've been after a warm amber/vanilla and was hoping this would be the ticket. The opening is more floral heavy than expected and very powdery - it feels mature, not necessarily in a good way. Like old school grandma perfume, but then again maybe that's part of the allure of this house? But as the dry down begins it definitely takes on a more masculine facet. Not so much so that I wouldn't consider it unisex, but I do think it reminds me more of something my husband would wear than myself. It's still on my wrist and clothes the next day but fore mentioned husband did not mention it so the sillage is minimal.  This is so close to the perfect scent for me but the rose ruins it as it tends to make me headachey and most likely adds to the grandma vibe."", 'I was curious to try this for so long and finally received a 10 ml decant. My favorite amber is Ambre Precieux from MPG so I have that as a reference and comparison. At first I didn\'t think I was going to like it. My first impression was ""this is a woman\'s perfume"". The opening is very floral, with the rose and geranium front and center. The rose is VERY high quality and that\'s what makes it endurable for me. It\'s a jammy rose and the geranium adds sweetness and freshness. For the first 30 minutes it stays pretty much like this with some nice wafts of vanilla coming in as it dries down. On me (I live in a humid climate) it takes nearly 45 to dry down. One of the elements which makes this very different from Ambre Precieux is that it changes a few times in the course of a wearing. This makes it much more interesting than Ambre Precieux which basically smells the same for the duration after the drydown.  The first phase is the floral phase, if you\'re a guy and you\'re self conscious about smelling \'girly\' you\'ll want to wait for the drydown to leave the house. Also, be aware gentlemen: if you spray this on fabric it takes FOREVER for the rose note to burn off. It will smell very floral for hours if you spray your clothes or fabric. Also, there is a minty, eucalyptus or camphorous note after the rose starts to fade. Once the rose and camphor is gone it transforms into an addictive amber that\'s completely unisex. Second phase it starts to smell almost like Muscs Ravageur on me. The musk, vanilla, amber and nutmeg give that same musky pastry vibe. If you like musky vanilla/amber you\'ll love this one. My skin tends to amplify musks (I am Mr Musky after all) and this fragrance is sexy as heck when it dries down and starts projecting. I\'ve seen comparisons to Shalimar and while I get that they\'re similar I would never confuse them. The amber/vanilla mixing with the nutmeg creates a light eggnog accord but it\'s not prominent. Third phase it starts to get a bit more butterscotchy, creme brulee-ish and reminds me of a less complex and deep Ambre Precieux. This is probably my favorite part of the journey being a lover of Ambre Precieux. Fourth phase it become a skin scent. Very cozy, warm and comforting fragrance. I can smell it on me all day when I wear it but after about 4-5 hours it doesn\'t project as much. After I finish this decant I\'m going to buy a 4oz bottle. It\'s really well made. High quality ingredients. Expertly crafted. Worth every penny and I don\'t say that about a lot of fragrances because I know how much they\'re marked up. Amazing value for the money spent. I don\'t know if I\'m going to retire Ambre Precieux (it\'s kind of sad how thin and watered down it has become) but I will make my bottle last much longer by wearing Ambre 114 as well. They might layer well and I\'ll have to try that sometime. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR LOVERS OF AMBERS AND OTHER COMFORT FRAGRANCES.', 'Soft , clean, worm , a bit dry.', ""I start this year following my perfumed passion, I recover some old decants and I only come across amber fragrances. Amber is a symbol of happiness and health, the healing properties of amber help to extract negative emotions and absorb painful symptoms. The number 114 is a mix of attributes and symbolism of the numbers 1 and 4. The number 1 appears twice in this number and that amplifies its strength. Appearing twice, it also represents Master Number 11.Number 1 usually symbolizes new beginnings, progress, success, ambition, achievements, independence and moving forward. Master Number 11 means serving the mission and purpose of our soul. The number 4 indicates that it is slowly moving towards your goals, pragmatism, truth, system, building the foundations for the future, determination and enthusiasm. The number 114 generally signifies pragmatism, putting efforts to serve one's soul's purpose and mission and create a foundation for future security. This is the story I like to tell today... Spiced Amber is one of the 114 promised ingredients, the mix of thyme and nutmeg it is strong from the start ... turns into a warm sweet mix with a slight hint of wood here and there ... overall neutral due to being just a little bit off. . . a lot of moss. Well done, not boring. It has a lot of everything, but everything is distinguishable. Sillage is average, longevity is good!"", ""So happy I got a big bottle, because this has grown on me a lot. Maybe it's just my nose, but I think a little ageing may have made the vanilla more prominent. Last winter I found it very herbal, spicy and quite harsh. I could only mange a few sprays and still found it suffocating. Now I get that smooth vanilla-amber everyone is raving about, even with heavy application. Classy, warm, smooth, herbal, spicy and beautiful. I advice anyone to try this again at a later point if it doesn't rock your boat at first, as I suspect it was not only my nose that matured here, but also the scent."", 'This is a fantastic pure amber, so instead of describing the notes etc etc which other people have already done, I’ll list what comes to mind when I smell this: old leather bound books, creamy parchment paper, wintertime, a fitted brown tweed blazer with brown leather gloves.  I can’t say that this is a feminine-leaning or girly amber but I feel very much womanly wearing this. It’s smooth and sexy- not “dolled up for the dance club” sexy, it’s more casual but still quite refined. The vanilla is slight but perfectly blended to prevent the resinous notes from being too heady (ie. Penhaligon’s Kensington Amber- feels like being hit over the head, definitely more masculine IMO). The aromatic, herbal feel is present for the whole duration on my skin but not overpoweringly so.  I bought the cute, narrow little bottle for $25 because I wasn’t sure about it at first from the HdP sample set, for some reason the sample wasn’t performing too well on me, but I will definitely be getting a bigger size. Ambre 114 is perfect.', ""Going back to my sample box. Interesting how fragrances that you didn't enjoy the first time around can evolve. I remember thinking that this was a boring simple Amber. Was it the name that pinpoint my opinion? Is it the cold weather now that suddenly makes this perfum cosy like a warm blanket? It is soft yet non linear. More masculine this time around. It is very well-blanded.  Almost an intimate smell.  I would want to smell like that when I'm all alone...  And I wanna be cuddled."", ""A gorgeous festive fragrance - apparently, due to the hyped up Christmas mood I'm in, I'm imagining cinnamon. Ambre 114 is a gorgeous spicy treat, a little boozy (makes me think about fine cognac), with a cosy amber-y drydown. Spectacular!"", ""This is gorgeous. I think it's almost a spot-on twin of Mercier Ambre Passion. Same buttery, powdery vanilla. I like Ambre 114 a little better and it lasts longer and packs more punch."", ""This is high end, artistic perfumery, i love the concept of the house and i want to try more of their creations! This opens somehow fresh, herbal and spicy, the nutmeg and the thyme uplift it and it starts very unique. After a few minutes the amber, the tonka and the vanilla come to the the surface and this becomes sweet ambery but never cloying. It's elegant, smooth, a bit churchy, dark and waxy but never too much. On the deep drydown it becomes a beautiful spicy vanilla.  The performance is amazing, 12+ hours longevity with great projection. This is not loud but smooth, it develops on your skin in the most elegant way. Imagine a guy laid back on an armchair in front of the fireplace reading a book. It's easy to wear if you like that type of scents and it could be a signature scent. I find it a bit masculine but surely a woman could pull this off.  Overall, this is art in a bottle! From the packaging, to the bottle, to the scent itself this fragrance is trying to tell you a story! One of my favorite ambers of all time!"", ""First spray...whoa! Too jarring, almost peppery. I was very sad and disappointed. Then, I waited for the dry down. I was hoping for a creamier, vanilla-tinged amber floral. This is SO dry and masculine on me.  30 minutes later: it's sweet, but not in a pleasant way. I can see how others might like this fragrance, but it's not for my particular skin chemistry"", 'While I do appreciate this fragrance for its quality, it\'s not my kind of thing. Gladly I tested before buying. What I did not like about it were a few things: -it reminded me a lot of a dated men\'s frag: Lapidus Homme. Lapidus is somewhat more sweet, but I immediately got the same vibe from Amber 114. I don\'t quite like Lapidus Homme. -while other reviews claim Amber 114 to be fresh (compared to some others), to me it came about quite dull and ""closed"". -no wow factor. Some reviewers said to wait for the dry down. While that had some enjoyable aspects, Lapidus Homme never disappeared and a pot pourri vibe joined the mix. The blend also reminded me of a rose/oud combo. However, as said, quality is great. A nice blend that did not fell apart one moment for me. Longevity and sillage are both good as well. 6,5/10', ""This is probably my 2nd most favorite Ambre scent following Guerlain Ambre Eternal. This is a nice blend.

Insolence described a strange herbal aspect that I get too. And it last quite a while, especially if I apply more than 1-2 sprays. An intense spicy herbal alcoholy (gin? Alcohol + thyme? I dunno..) aspect that can become overwhelming in the first hour if I apply liberally, to the point that I almost find it hard to breathe. It is loud and has a strong vintage feel in this fase, reminesent of a masculine shalimar. I hate that ambre 114 does this, because once that fog lift what's left of it is sooo soft. It goes from too much to too little, sigh. I keep applying one spray at a time because I do love it after that slightly difficult hour! I'm getting used to it and experimenting with the amounts. But suprised that not many experience these aspects as strongly as I do! UPDATE: seems this works a million times better for me in hot weather. Probably because I have very cool skin (and low body temperature)? I am not getting the same sharpness now, and much more warmth, the Amber in itself is also more prominent, wheras it is very herbal on me during winter.

Performance is overall below average on my skin, with a moderate projection falling to soft after an hour, and an overall longevity of 4 to 5 hours. I was very impressed when I got my hands on this one at the beginning of my fragrance journey, but have to say that later in, it has become just a like for me.

All the notes start orchestrating into a beautiful and well blended composition. The most dominant are definitely geranium, amber, patchouli, nutmeg, with some cedarwood, sandalwood and rose, and I can detect some vanilla and tonka bean too, not overpowering though.

It’s alittle old smelling like a lot of fougeres because there’s a lot of notes blended in and has earthy elements like geranium rose patchouli etc.. You have to like older fragrances and earthy notes blended in with sweet resins in order to like this. This may not be for you if you just want something super resinous / sweet or modern or more geared for an easy experience on the nose. I have a harder time getting in the mood for this one,  I have to be in the mood for this kind of fragrance. But I do see myself wearing this in the spring / summer when it’s a little cooler and just wear something sweet without feeling like it’ll be too much for my nose or out of season. The quality is superb and that’s the consensus with everyone here on this one. Thats partly why it’s easier for me to force myself to wear this one when I’m unsure if I want to. Edit: imortant note!

Well done and a great scent btw, I do agree with the slight resemblance to Shalimar in the drydown!"", 'This is the first Amber dominate scent I truly love. It is truly unisex and I’ve gotten complement on every wearing 🤗... the caraway seed gives it an almost anise vibe that can be described as licoricey or almost a tad bit menthol , that sets this one apart in my opinion it is somehow resinous yet fresh at the same time. I’ve gotten my nose on at-least 35 niche / Indy / designer Amber frags .... and this is still tops for me . It last for DAYS literally on fabric and 3-5+ before on skin before it stops projecting . 9.8/10 ——— only because I’m sure there is something more magical out there', 'The spice/herbal quality makes me think of pine. Unisex although I feel it would do better on a man. I am going to try this with a vanilla to see if its more for me. This isnt a thick amber that you find in a lot of perfumes. It is almost like holding a piece of fossilized amber. On my skin its a very aromatic amber so to me its like a cold amber.', 'I thought the name 114 would mean a year, like the numbers in other Histoires de Parfum fragrance names do. For that reason I imagined that something that would emulate ancient times would maybe smell a little unrefined, carnal and intense. Then I looked it up and found out that this has nothing to do with the year 114, but it‘s supposed to be made of 114 ingredients.  Well, they must be very well-blended. This fragrance doesn‘t smell chaotic, but on the contrary pure and simple. And of course, not like I imagined beforehand at all. It‘s a very smooth and soft amber. The opening is herbal and resinous, dark green and woody. I smell patchouli and a kind of tree-sap. But underneath that lies a vanilla-focussed amber, as fine and drily sweet as powdered sugar. After several tries I also discovered that there is something soothing, spa- or sauna-like in this. The drydown feels so comforting. Like some others mentioned, I get a bit of a Guerlain/Shalimar-like sensation, too.  For such a resinous oriental fragrance I find Ambre 114 to be quite understated and intimate, it‘s close to the skin and of average longevity. I feel like this would be good as a cozy scent for cold and stressful days. Completely unisex, I find it feminine on me, but I think I would find it masculine on a man. I like it a lot.', ""Mary Pickford dressed in a sheer pink robe of silk and fur; powder-puff in hand, sat at her standard vaudevillian vanity backstage.

Glad I'm stuck with something pleasant, could've been worse."", 'Very underated scent IMHO. Not really talked about..??! This is a wonderful amber. Woodsy...a tad resiny too.

The scents are all classy and rich smelling...no ""mall scents""...Unique as well !! I am impressed so far. Decent sillage and projection.... More please !!!', 'I think this is one of the best amber scents around. Its warm and nutty and smooth. Love it.', ""wonderful pure amber fragrance. it starts off very nutty and spicy - i think the ordinary person might be put off by the opening, because it's dry, herbal, grassy (vetiver) and not sweet at all. the drydown is whole sweet heavenly amber, though - something everyone would like. it sits close to the skin on me (the way i like scents) but i can smell it all day, and when someone leans in to hug you, they will smell it, too. when i think of how amber smells, this drydown is what i think of. so perfectly warm in cooler weather."", 'Ambre 114 is straight up GORGEOUS!!!! I get amber, powder, patchouli, spices and a bit of vanilla. It is smooth and amazing!!!

Ambre 114 is easy to wear, elegant and smooth. I like it a lot, but it lacks the lushness and width for me to devote my love. ****(*)', 'Certainly a unisex amber dominant fragrance, it is like a slightly spicy slightly rose amber with lots of vanilla in the drydown.

I do love this one. I am a fan of ambers in general, and this one impressed me right out of the bottle. I love the way the ingredients are balanced just right here. The vanilla, benzoin and tonka give the sweetness, and it has a clean, sharp side which is the patchouli, geranium & caraway. There is a very good contrast going on here which works together perfectly. Histoires de Parfums is not a house I have tried out before but now I am very impressed. It has a sharp, crisp quality with a resinous sweetness from the amber, but at no point does this become to syrupy or gourmandish in any way. It's not like Ambre Sultan or Ambre Narguilé in that the amber is very foody (savory in the case of the Serge Lutens and Sweet in the case of Hermès). Nor is this a leathery amber in the case of the Cuir de Russie type variety. This is just refined, high quality, no fuss amber. This is a standalone, almost reference amber fragrance. I would recommend it!"", ""Ambre 114 arrived in my mailbox today. I put it on several hours ago so this is my first impression. I bought a .5 oz bottle based off a review under Grand Soir from Frag member black_orchid. I do like Ambre 114, but it trails behind my three favorite amber dominant scents: Ambre Fétiche by Annick Goutal, l'Artisan Ambre Extreme and Grand Soir by MFK.  114 is one of the better quality creamy amber compositions, with vanilla, woods and lots of benzoin. I think this is perfect for Fall weather. The projection on me is a little softer than I was hoping, but still a choice offering from Histoires de Parfums. I have no regrets with my blind bottle purchase though I don't love it.  Time for me to track down a sample of Luten's Ambre Sultan."", ""I was expecting something amazing from the original pyramid but it's just an unpleasant and undefined skinscent of cumin-caraway and benzoin."", ""this starts with amber and some dry woods.. i think i smell a hint of the caraway, along with vetiver, cedar and sandalwood. this is definitely a more woody amber. it gets a bit powdery after a few minutes. after about 10-15 minutes i get the tonka and maybe a hint of nutmeg, followed by vanilla. dry, woods mixed with soft powdery amber and tonka/vanilla. what's not to love? this scent will be fantastic in fall and winter."", 'My immediate thought upon smelling this; This opening is M7 Funny no one has commented on the resemblance yet!', 'The single most overated Amber fragrance on the planet.

Sweet, warm, enticing amber and spices. Genuinely leans unisex. I can definitely pick up on the geranium, nutmeg and vanilla/benzoin.  I've worn this in summer and winter. It's not a very heavy amber so I wear it in all seasons and day/night.  So perfect."", ""pencil shavings, vanilla, honey, powder. This is nice if you don't want a heavy scent, a lighter sweet oriental but does smell similar to a much older generation of vanilla spice powder scents.  There is rose and patchouli in here but not as distinct notes. I think this house is really good at using these two together somewhere in the backseat of the fragrance to support the other notes. Not for me but I could see this being perfect for someone wanting a light vanilla woods and spice."", ""This is a really nice amber. It's cozy, comfortable, easy to wear, but still spicy and elegant and not super sweet and a bit powdery. I am a wary of ambers that can get too sweet or too gourmandish, but I love ones that are more balsalmic an smokey or herbal ,like Ambre Sultan, Ambre Aurea, Ambre Fétiche, etc. and this definitely seems closer to those types although a bit more vanilla-y. I like that 114 is a bit lighter too, I've worn this during the day and to work. I love the spicy nutmeg and caraway opening as well it has that herbal/spicyness to it. It kind of makes me feel like I'm wearing a softer, more muted Ambre Sultan in a way, although they don't smell the same. I have yet to smell Ambre Precieux, but since people are comparing it to this one It's making me want to more. Nice job HdP!"", 'Creamy, sweet, and rich perfume. Very warm and cozy. Long lasting, good quality perfume.', ""This makes me think of Dune. It's not a dupe, but it has the same spicy, bold, arid feeling to it. There's more vanilla in this though, and despite it's name I'm not getting a lot of amber. I'm not really a spice fan, but this has grown on me as it's developed."", 'The coziest amber around plus it’s actually an oriental-fougere so it won’t hold you in firm amber grip as it will caress you with vanilla, tonka and lovely nutmeg. Under a polished, modern surface there are some more wonderful things to sense from time to time as spices, rose, vetiver and there’s a certain vintage, kind of musty feel that seems perfectly in place - airy and manly. Very nice, calm and quite sexy. A perfect seduction fragrance for a man.', ""This may be the amber I've been sniffing for lately.  It's soft, with a tiny spark of spices, in a lovely powdery bed of musky vanilla. The vetiver and patchouli offsets the smooth sweet tonka very pleasantly. It's remarkably well blended, and behaves well if the wearer might be around fragrance sensitive folks.  Went perfectly with this sunny autumn day."", 'A very smooth and likeable fragrance. Sweet and warm and creamy with a touch of powder. It is neither young or old and playfully glides between masculinity and femininity, and it is hard to put a face to the smell. However, I can imagine somebody bright, confident and creative pulling it off with ease. As others have said previously, if you are wanting to explore the world of amber / Middle-Eastern fragrances, this is a lovely and pleasant place to start.', 'This isn’t for me. Too powdery. But great performance, and if you’re going for a vitage vibe I can see this being your style. I agree with the other reviews saying it reminds them of Tabu.  If you’re looking for a less powdery amber, I love Gran Soir by MFK. Amber oud by killian is also nice. I’m still looking for an amber at a lower price point to fall in love with', ""Yes, there is an old-fashioned quality to Ambre 114, but it is a mild and lovely amber that I agree would make it an excellent entry-level amber for someone who wants to expand into rich ambers but prefers a lighter fragrance. There also is almost a powdery effect to this fragrance, but it is more of a hint rather than the wallop many powder accords pack. I applied this fairly liberally this morning, and it has dried down to a vanillic amber skin scent. I will wear this on days when I want to wear a fragrance but will be proximal to scent-sensitive people, and I will reserve my Ambre Sultan and L'Ombre Fauve for when I want to wear an amber with more oomph. Ambre 114 has held on for eight hours, but it is quite light at this point, like a faint but lovely presence."", 'Ooohhh...this reminds me of my Aunt that wore Tabu. She definately would have loved this one. I get nuances of Tabu and other retro powerhouses from back in the day...very well done I am very impressed with Histoires de Parfums.

Ambre 114 is a sultry cabaret singer with a deep voice sitting on the piano with her red sequin gown,high slit, and even redder lipstick, looking something like Rita Hayworth...red hot!!

It's smooth and creamy, and a little sweet (caramely), and even a touch smoky. It's a complex and well-blended fragrance. It's really difficult to pick out individual notes. It's decidedly amber, but everything else is so beautifully and artfully blended together to support the star of this scent that I really can't pick out a single note, other than the amber. This is probably among my top 2 amber fragrances of all time - maybe even #1. I absolutely ADORE it. It's addictive. I also really, really love 1740 Marquis de Sade in this line - and layered under Ambre 114 - HEAVEN! Brings out the Marquis' feminine side. ;) In addition, layering it under 1804 brings out a bit of floral sweetness and amps up Ambre 114's femininity factor - SO LOVELY!"", ""Notice how everyone raves about this stuff ? And for good reasons. As a fan of ambers, this is the one I compare all others too. I have a full bottle, but one of those $35 15ml samples will last anyone far beyond where they've made their mind up.  If you should just starting out with ambers, one of the most solid places to begin your amber adventure.  Great stuff."", 'At the first whiff, I think this smells like Shalimar. There is a soft opening of powder and citrus that is evocative of Shalimar. That opening note is gone quickly and Ambre 114 comes into its own. The amber here is very cuddly and warm. This is creamy and maternal. There is a soft vanilla and some delicate spice notes, but this is not at all gourmand. This is perfect for crisp fall days. Amber is a crowded category and you may already have a favorite, but this is definitely one worth trying.', 'This is a wonderful masculine amber. I would not call this unisex.

It\'s one of the nicest vanilla/amber perfumes I have ever tried! Edit: it also kind of reminds me of Guerlain Oriental Brulant but with more vanilla.

Underneath the powdery vanilla, a refreshing zinginess (from the nutmeg and caraway?) keeps the whole thing aloft.

I'd say this was a pleasant, smooth, well structured herbaceous/ woody/ floral fragrance; all of it's sharp edges have been smoothed out by the amber that carries it with great aplomb, as one would expect from a house like HdP.

This is not how it reads on my skin.  There is a strong herbal aspect to it in the beginning that creates a medicinal vibe - I find it quite disturbing. On my skin, a nutmeg note is very pronounced too, which makes 114 almost pungent in the first hour. This phase reminds me of Prada's Amber and I must admit, I can't enjoy anything about it. It's too heavy and vintage-y for my liking. 114 becomes much prettier after several (2-3) hours. Salty nuances of ambergris show up and they are beautiful. Earthy notes are gone, giving caramel like sweetness a bigger space. The fragrance loses its weight and becomes quite enjoyable to my nose. That being said, it also becomes very abstract smelling.  Considering the fact that I like amber perfumes with a luminous touch (Ambre Nuit, for instance) Ambre 114's chances to enchant me were already low in the beginning, but I still feel disappointed. I expected something resinous, yet airy. Instead, this smells retro and vague, and doesn't really stand out. PS My pillow likes this fragrance better.

I love amber scents so much. I'd say this is full bottle worthy, but I recently dropped more money than I should have on Diptyque's Volutes, another amber of the same variety, but with honey and Tobacco added.  When/if I finish Volutes, I might buy this instead of replacing. Edit: after 10 more minutes or so, I detect cedar and other woody aromas emerging.

I can't work out if its the caraway, geranium or patchouli. Its a quiet cut. When the spicy notes escape its as if they have lost something in their battle for freedom. There is also a rose note that subtly colours the fragrance. Like the spice, its struggles from the sugary depths to add a hint of colour. The overall effect, at least for me, is Caron's Pour un Homme heated in the oven until the lavender cooks off. Then gentle spices, rose water and lots of amber are added as it cools. To finish, its dusted in icing sugar - ready to eat. But as we all know: you can't have your cake and eat it too – better stick to smelling this confectionery treat."", ""This one opens up with a sharp spicy note. My guess that would be the caraway. It then quickly settles down to a soft creamy powdery scent. I get amber, vanilla and geranium. Geranium in this is prominent and it does remind me of baby powder. Moderate projection and longevity on my skin. It could be better if I applied more since I'm testing it from a small 0.7ml vial. IMO, it's a different take on amber fragrances with a floral twist and I can see that someone may like it. However, I prefer my amber creamy and spicy only so this is a pass for me. Sorry."", 'I used to associate ""amber"" with notions such as exoticism, opulence, and (in extreme cases toothache-inducing) sweetness. Histoires de Parfums with their ""Ambre 114"" have literally shattered my prejudice towards this note by demonstarting that an amber-centred perfume can also be light, smooth and fresh.  Even though Ambre 114 is alleged to have been composed of 114 elements, it is a linear perfume in my books. Basically, it´s all about amber, vanilla and patchouli, perhaps with barely perceptible whiffs of nutmeg in the head and sandalwood in the heart. Its linearity is prefectly fine with me since it contains ingredients of the highest quality, definitely worthy of its niche fragrance status as well as its hefty price tag. In my view, Ambre 114 is a charming and surprisingly versatile perfume. Thanks to this offering and other fragrances from their line, Histoires de Parfums have swiftly become one of my favourite perfume houses. Bravo!', 'There are a lot of amber perfume in the market and some are dull and the other quite a bit, but with this fragrance, which excelled craftsman making harmony between lavander and amber and vanilla, making it for me like the best amber Perfume I have seen in my life with best quality It makes you feel luxury and grandeur. 10/10', ""I know, I am the biggest peasant of fragantica, but this is not the revelation, which this perfume's reputation implies. It turns very sweet and even a little powderish, it is not a bit rough, and for sure it is not a smokey amber, just a mediocre, alright ambre, somewhat without own character to me and even a bit too drugstore.  At the moment I favourite L'Occitane's Amber of all the ones, I've tried (which is lot, I still seek the perfect amber - to give you an idea of what I also tried: Madini's ambers, Ava Luxe's ambers, L'Occitane's Labdanum, Ambre Fetiche, Cuir Ambre, Reminiscene's Ambre, Ambre Gris, Ambre'Dor, Artisan's two ambres, Blue Amber, Burnt Amber by Neil Morris... I think, you get the picture.) Save your money."", '2nd review I smelled this agian in a dept.store not remembering my first impression. I must be old... Anyway this was suggested by a lovely SA as I told her I crave amber. To be honest I crave many things. I love rose, natural vanilla and many other notes. It depneds on my mood. When I\'m in an amber mood nothing stops me! I tried so many. I wished that Ambre de l\'Occitane could work for me, but it was just nice. The Sa saw it right. As Ambre 114 hit my skin and my nose I was in delight. OMG! What a scent! It\'s really unapologetical, intense, present but soft and round. She told me: ""Go around with this and you will see. In a hour at least two people will ask what you\'re wearing!"" Off I went and felt a little conscious about my perfume but nicely enveloped in it. I forgot about. In a very little time two other SA in the store asked me: ""Oh, what is this wonderful perfume you\'re wearing?"" Mmmm... power of commercial brainwashing? I doubt so. I love this perfume. Soon or later I will shell money for this, maybe next fall. Or before.', ""Excellent reference amber in that it's fairly close to a conifer extraction and isn't merged with any notes as competition. It's linear, rich, and has an almost oily/buttery aspect to it, yet there's nothing cloying going on here. Given that most modern representations of amber are really just interpretations with virtually no connection to actual amber (think sweet, vanilla/powder pudding type scents), this is very well-done. With that said, there are far more interesting takes on amber out there (Amber Absolute, L'Ombre Fauve, Les Nereides Imperial) that aren't taking the note too far from its origins, and are augmenting it with complimentary notes. This doesn't do anything like that, so what you end up with is an incredibly well-done accord. Given that, I'd say this is best suited for the amber fans alone, mainly because its such a true-to-form representation.  Longevity weighs in at an average 6 hours or so, but the scent sits quite close to the skin for most of that. Very impressive in what it does, despite not doing a whole lot of anything."", 'Heavenly Amber,great lasting power and delicious from the start to the drydown. I agree with Coutureguru it is highly reminiscent of the edp of must de cartier in the drydown, the best bit!', ""Most of my perfumes are heavy. They suit me and I love heavy. 114 is heavy and attracts people.  Big bottle, not very attractive but the presentation is good. Does not smell like anything else, can't compare to anything or maybe with a 10 course meal at a very exclusive restaurant?"", 'Excellent Fragrance.Vanilla predominant in me. So Luxurious!!! AMAZING!!!  I rank it well: Smell: 10/10 Projection: 10/10 Longevity: 1000/10', ""Elegant, light amber. Transparent and highly wearable like Prada L'eau Ambree, but with better lasting power."", 'This is closer to Ambre Precieux and Blue Amber than the herbal Ambre Sultan which conjures up an Asian grocery store. It is light and airy (unlike Blue Amber) but by no means lacking in the projection/longevity department. It also strikes me as having complexity and ""intelligence"" - this isn\'t a headshop or foody-style amber. It leaves a delicate trail, polite and restrained but present. It doesn\'t need to shout. I also detect a hint of rose and nutmeg which add a feminine warmth and sweetness. It is my favourite amber.', 'Ambre 114 by Histoire de Parfums - A rather different accord greets one initially. A somewhat piquant and savory thyme commingles with the cinnamon-like nutmeg, fostering an atypical, sweetly herbaceous slant. A nascent amber draws the curious blend to its heart. Here, the amber comes into full bloom, with its earthy sweetness, noticeably tempered by an ample geranium, with its forceful greenness and faintly sour undertone. Glimpses of a minty patchouli as well as the clumped, field-grass aspect of vetiver also present. A creamy, balsamic, and faintly spicy, woods accord can also be discerned. And, a lovely, cabernet-like rose makes an appearance. Transitioning to the base, the resinous amber is lifted by a warm, vanillic tonka bean. Labdanum couples with vanilla and benzoin to create a wonderful, ambergris illusion. A clean musk adds to the delightful experience. An enchanting drydown ensues. Admittedly, this is a beautiful, sweetish scent, with average projection and longevity. However, its composition is somewhat banal, hence, my unenthusiastic ""Thumbs Up"" rating.', '114....my love!!!!! This is probably my favorite amber on the market. It is sharp, thick, sweet and herbal! My gosh. It opens with a very herbal amber, as it dries down it becomes more spicy, and sweeter and dense. During the dry down you can almost feel the components unfolding on your skin. Funny thing is, if you engange in any activity that warms the skin, this scent begins to pick up steam. I got in an argument with my coworker about this. She had sworn that I sprayed more on after running up the stairs. I could go on and on but just read the other reviews. Here is how it performs on my skin: Longevity - 2 days ;o) Projection - feet away Sillage - leaves a lengthy trail and lingers forever Compliment Factor - beyond great Overall this is a beautiful rendition of Amber. It puts you in the mind of Precieux and Blue Amber. I would not own all three of these but two would be wonderful. Here is one fact. Histories has done an unbelievable job at making perfume. Noir Patchouli, 1969, 1740, Tubereuse 3 and 114 are all gorgeous. Hats off to one of the most underrated fragrance houses in the industry', 'Simply said: a beauty. This refined scent is soft and fresh even. An amber perfume for those who like to have it sweetened by vanilla, and uplifted by a musky rose, some sandalwood an a light cedar. I am smitten.', 'I experienced a different fragrance becouse on my skin amber is covered by all the spices around it: so 114 elements are not a jocke! Probably Ambra by Etro is more suitable for my skin.', ""Complex and intriguing. Probably one of the best ambre scent I've ever bought.  Not always available everywhere."", ""Are there 114 individual components in this fragrance? Only the folks at Histoire de Parufms know. To my nose the most prominent notes are benzoin, rose, caraway, nutmeg and sandalwood. The overall effect is a rounded, woody, powdery oriental which is simultaneously transparent and grounded. I wouldn't call it earthy, nor would I call it gourmand.  Sillage: discrete if applied lightly, 7 feet if applied liberally Longevity: 9 hours If you're looking for a well behaved, powdery niche amber, look no further. Its not ground breaking or edgy, but Ambre 114 is well made with a complex composition that remains harmonious despite the surprisingly large number of clearly discernible notes."", ""Beautiful opening, smooth and resinous with hints of rose and spice. Histoires seem to have an obsession with a particular note I've also detected heavily in 1725 too. Seems to be not-too-sweet Tonka bean. The notes also list nutmeg, caraway and the rose. And Ambre114 does open with a blast of that dark tonka-mix and subtly-spiced amber. For me, it creates a 'dark-bean' effect that a lot of you may be familiar with, and can come across as oud-like even. It's certainly oriental-arabian, but again I was hoping on the sweeter side. However, this is sweeter than 1725. And in fact, imo, much better overall- so I've rated it higher! What really stood out in my sample was the blending- like the finest of cocktails, this is one of the smoothest compositions I've ever tried! And it's amazing for it, it's seductive just because of its smoothness, but the amber is of the glowing-radiant quality too. The sweetness didn't take long to grow, once there, this House's quality of ingredients really begins to shine. This also keeps the powdery side well down, it's very hard to detect here, and I like it like that! Just as others have said this is much smoother than Ambre Sultan, containing little or none of that scents' herbal sharpness. No oregano or dusty spice rack here. Resembles SoOud's Asmar quite a bit more if I may attempt some comparison, I detect no coffee in both, but Ambre114 is much sweeter. Some geranium, I would have preferred iris really as it is a little sweeter, I think the real problem was projection for me. I just do not wear fragrances just for their dry-downs alone. Then everyone would be a winner almost! While the opening here is interesting and very pleasant (and of course, smooooth!), I would have liked a touch more sugar, weight and loudness to score it a 4. The dark/sweet amber-geranium combo that starts appearing in wafts about 1 hour in is nice, but it becomes a little too thin too quickly. Maybe some heavier vanilla/woods or even insence or Oud would've provided a more satisfying conclusion and complete drydown- like some of the Montales are very good at doing. It's smoother than Ambre Precieux, showcasing how well done it really is- a huge plus. A step just above the boozy Frapin's Caravelle Epicee imo, which this in quite direct competition with. Overall, one of the markets better ambers. 3/5."", 'IFRA has ruined yet another beautiful fragrance. I despise IFRA with everything in me. This fragrance used to be so beautiful and a beast. Now it’s just a ghost of its former self. Not even half of its original strength. What a shame, This perfume was my favorite of this house. But no more. You have to spray it 25 times to get even an hour. No projection. What a shame. IFRA has ruined more beautiful perfumes than anyone else. I hope IFRA goes bankrupt and disappears. They need to stop interfering with perfumers. We have done just fine for thousands of years without crooked lying IFRA interfering . They need to go. Nobody wants them . All they’re doing is making sure all we can buy is synthetic perfumes. All the beautiful natural ingredients will be extinct and u will never see them in perfume anymore. Chemical companies own IFRA. It’s a hugely corrupt company.', 'Amber is a dangerous territory where sweetness can easily become overwhelming turning a fragrance into an unbearable heaviness. The big point of strength of Amber 114 is its extremely balanced blend of spices/herbs and resionous notes (mainly benzoin) joined by woods and rose that make of this composition quite an easy wear in which sweetness is carefully tamed and dosed to become a side aspect.  Overall I\'d say that while Ambre 114 can be considered as one of the most complex and deep ambers around, at the same time it is outstanding for its incredible wearability and ""lightness"".  These things don\'t happen by accident. Amazing Stuff! Rating: 8.5-9/10', ""Ahhhh man this is gorgeous! A sandalwood and a beautiful creamy light sweet Amber with a touch of vanille is what I'm getting from this. I am now picking up a rose note within this beautiful mix. This scent is just enchanting and really divine to your olfactory senses. And it never overpowers or gets sickly sweet but just sits right on the skin giving you that perfect satisfaction. I have to say this is the best ever ambre fragrance that I have ever smelled. The way the dry sandalwood mixes in with the amber and that touch of vanille is a work of genious. And the way the creator has managed to get that floral aspect too it with the rose is amazing. Full bottle worthy without any hesitation. To sum up a gorgeous stunning creamy sandalwood amber fragrance which stands tall over most amber based fragrances."", 'Growing up in suburban Chicago, I had a best friend whose mother wore only Guerlain Shalimar. She was a well-to-do woman, with red colored hair, always kept in an early 1960s style. She drove a gold Cadillac DeVille convertible which she used to drive to her daily amusements: the racetrack, the shopping center, lunching with her girlfriends. She kept a large bottle of Smirnoff\'s Vodka in the wood paneled den which was dispensed with a pump, and she refreshed herself with it every night around 5pm. She smoked Carlton cigarettes which she bought by the carton. Meals were basic: lamb chops with mint jelly, salad with thousand island dressing, chocolate ice cream.  They had two servants: a man who lived the basement and watered the birdbath and took care of outside things; and another lady from Jamaica who was the maid.  They were wealthy people because they had two Cadillacs, a two car garage with an electric door opener, a 25"" color television, air conditioning, and an above ground swimming pool.  But the husband and wife did not get along. He slept in his own room and kept a little bag of chocolates in the top drawer of his dresser. He was very strict with my friend and forbid her from closing the bedroom door when I played games or dolls with her.  Years later it was revealed that he had a mistress on the south side of Chicago. And his wife had been married four times and when she was young was quite well known around Chicago area nightclubs for her record producing success with jazz musicians. All this is something that comes back to me when I spray Ambre 114. It truly smells like Shalimar reincarnated.', 'Ambre 114 is straight up GORGEOUS!!!! I get amber, powder, patchouli, spices and a bit of vanilla. It is smooth and amazing!!! I would say its more of a dress up fragrance, however if you always look good even going to the grocery store, you can wear this everyday. Ambre 114 is in my top 10', ""I don't get any sweetness, tonka, vanilla or anything with this. It's all amber, all woody on my skin. I like it but I don't think I would purchase. On me it definitely feels too masculine. I got a sample of this and I'm almost wondering if I got the wrong perfume in the sample based on the other reviews! I may give the rest of the sample to my husband, I would probably like it on him!"", 'This is a wonderful masculine amber. I would not call this unisex. The vetiver and woods are pronounced. I do not get any sweetness or vanilla. I would highly recommend this amber to anyone wanting a creamy, woody, manly amber. .', ""First spray...whoa! Too jarring, almost peppery. I was very sad and disappointed. Then, I waited for the dry down. I was hoping for a creamier, vanilla-tinged amber floral. This is SO dry and masculine on me.  30 minutes later: it's sweet, but not in a pleasant way. I can see how others might like this fragrance, but it's not for my particular skin chemistry"", ""This is the least powdery of theirs. I can't believe citrus notes are not listed. They are strongly there in the top! least favorite of this house so far, and I am an amber lover and collector; nice amber in the top but with too much citrus and Play Doh; becomes a bit of a nonfloral copy of Shalimar; strongest of theirs so far and not the powdery norm, then an almost chemical plastic note rises; this is really no better to me than a modern Molinard Amber or another inexpensive amber"", 'Graceful, sophisticated, for all seasons.

Or a skeezy older guy at a party for teens. I can't even gauge if its an objectively good fragrance, it just smells exactly like that type of guy and I can't separate them.

I literally think of Spite on every opening. I assume that is its particular mixture of the neroli and bergamot. TMC is the cleanest more pure sent I own. Very fresh and does come off as its influence, a sophisticated Moroccan soap. The lack of nuance provides it clean uniqueness. Also, for something so clean, its performance is not bad. It makes a good gym or summer evening scent.', 'Thierry Mugler Cologne is pretty much what I expected: a brilliant, Y2K-futuristic, squeaky-clean take on the traditional neroli-bergamot cologne that’s been popular for the past 300 years. Luca Turin describes it as having a “steam-iron” effect, and I do smell that, like a pressed shirt fresh from the dry cleaners. It’s not complicated, but it’s *bright*, more so than some other colognes like Neroli Portofino, which flirt with heavy sweetness. Mugler Cologne is invigorating, and blinding white. If you have a problem with synthetic white musk, steer very clear. Mugler Cologne is a spaceship, not a garden. I can embrace that, but I know some perfume lovers will wince. It’s surprisingly deft for something so minimalist. Sometimes I get an effect that reminds me of brilliant sunlight on stone, somewhere in the Mediterranean. Perfectly unisex, in both intent and effect.', ""Nice stuff. More lemongrass than neroli, I always thought. Big white musk in the base which will date it very obviously to the early 2000s.

Happy 🥳', 'I originally bought Come Together secondhand a few years ago, and really liked it! I used it up and was looking to try other things so I didn’t buy another bottle, but I would think about it from time to time. I used to only wear citrus and green and fresh fragrances, but I’ve changed and now mostly wear ambery patchouli scents including my now vintage stash of Angel. But I still love my greens, and I’ve been trying to rebuild them amongst my collection as they kinda disappeared over time with use and me moving on to other things. Randomly I was on Mercari looking for a desk lamp and under the items they recommend to me based off previous buys or views, was a bottle of Mugler Cologne! It was fate lol, the price was ridiculously good and I couldn’t let it get away from me. It arrived yesterday and I opened it when I got home and sprayed some on as I was settling in for the night. I do believe Come Together is the same fragrance, but I can’t help but wonder if my nose is picking up on a slight nuance in Cologne or if it’s just me telling myself that. Regardless, it’s the refreshing, soapy, green fragrance that I can’t seem to find a replacement for. It’s just so good. And I do wonder about its performance on various skin types. Many fragrances I have to reapply (I don’t mind), but not this! I can still smell it this morning, on my skin and in the air around me, which is so surprising to me. I really did not expect that. Could be because it’s winter and I’m not profusely sweating, but I remember Come Together lasting on me in the heat as well. Super sad this is discontinued, please bring it back Mugler! And bring the soaps and other body products back with it. 🥀', 'Do you know if Mugler Cologne is back?', 'Is this really what Creed was using as inspiration for original vetiver', ""This fragrance is a pleasant cologne, flirting with the original concept of 4711. It features a harmonious blend of green and citrus notes, with neroli and elegantly soft musk. Despite its simplicity, the fragrance still manages to convey a sense of depth and spatial quality. Its profile feels natural and effortlessly organic. However, I believe it's a missed opportunity that it isn't enhanced with a stronger infusion of something like Iso E. As is typical with colognes, its longevity lasts only a few hours at best, with weak projection. Overspraying and carrying the bottle with you throughout the day is highly recommended. What makes Mugler Cologne stand out is its minimalistic appeal. It’s not an overpowering fragrance; rather, it’s one that remains close to the skin, making it perfect for those who prefer subtlety in their everyday wear. The fragrance feels nostalgic, almost as if it captures the simplicity of childhood memories. I came across an interesting story related to the 'S note' on the Sorcery of Scent blog. During sales training sessions, this molecule was presented on a cushion saturated with it, sealed in a container. Upon opening it, employees were warned to brace for a sensory shock — it was recognizable as something reminiscent of human secretions post sexual activity. Personally, I don’t detect this note strongly, and based on some of the more bizarre reviews on Fragrantica, it seems autosuggestion can greatly influence perception. While this fragrance is beautifully composed — universal, minimalist, and perfect for summer — I can't recommend it due to its disappointing longevity. Its fleeting presence may be a dealbreaker for some. In fact, other fragrances like the iconic 4711, which shares a similar profile, offer comparable longevity and experience at a more affordable price. I saw a similar comment, but after some reflection, I must agree: Mugler Cologne indeed smells like Windows Vista.

To me it always smelled fresh, soapy, clean and downright delicious. It sat on my skin for decent few hours before I had to reapply it again. It was very special and I loved it. By the time I had finished the bottle I found it hard to find it again. It was like it was there one minute and then it was gone.  Now that it is no longer made, my heart aches for this around spring time when we have just come out of a cold harsh winter. It was the perfect time for it to really show its true colours to me as I could smell the freshness open up more so during this period. It was definitely a daytime fragrance for me and one I wish Demeter or Clean could make playing homage to such a beautiful real Clean fragrance. The neroli and the bergamot sit beautifully together in this fragrance and it’s crafted like a fine milled soap it was just so perfect for my skin tone. Nothing else in a ‘soapy’ range has come close to this beauty on me with the exception of White Linen but that’s a different scent altogether on my skin. I looked on eBay recently for it and was horrified by how much people are selling it for and the just as hefty postage costs.

This is not a terrible smell I suppose but, because I have that association, it’s not a pleasant smell for me.  This is very citrussy and very grassy, and I don’t get a soapy vibe at all.

A truly refreshing special fragrance.made with premium ingredients.. I miss it... Now, even the new edition are gone, but this first one was indeed spectacular.

It was a breath of fresh air back when it was launched - due to it's simplicity and linear structure. The scent never changes, what you spray is what you get - it's lack of development makes it easy to wear. This scent was based on the smell of a soap in a luxury hotel, it's basically a recreation of a soap smell.

That sounds super easy to find, I thought. (HA!) I finally hunted it down after a year given it was discontinued, and got a bottle. A part of me can die in peace now that I have experienced it and used it for a while. It\'s green, simple, juicy, fresh, crisp, warm, lush, clean, incredible. It flows in an inviting, comforting way, like a rolling pasture or a clearing in a forest. I know my bottle must be old, but it still is projecting beautifully. I wear it any season, any time of day, any where.  As for the name and design: There\'s something to be said for simplicity and letting the fragrance be honest in that way. I like how straightforward and clear it is. It\'s an incredibly well-done smell, truly for anyone to enjoy. [I have not tried the ""new"" formulation for it, but I am hoping to try it and see if it comes anywhere near the original. I\'ve not smelled any of the ""Reminds me of"" recommendations, but I hope to as well.

Before that, I didn't know many things: that a memory of a soap can be transformed into a scent and transcended through imagination into something bigger and brighter. I didn't know what musk or neroli is, the musk so much resembling warm washed skin without literally being it, the resemblance starting when it actually touches your human skin. The green that is just the right amount to fit the color of the liquid. Also, for me, Cologne is still a shining example of how classics can be re-invented in a futuristic way. Even more so, since this happened in the mass market territory. Not a simple sum of its parts: you can have orange blossom like this in lots of places, the neroli is not unique either, but the tangible musky presence around these simple notes pretty much is. You could also say Alien is just a jasmine scent and you'll be right, but you won't be saying anything, same with Angel. I can't even explain how this stays true to its very classic list of notes and at the same time renders them in an almost futuristic way.

If it were still in production I’d recommend it to people who want to smell like “perfume but not.” It’s ironic that Mugler would come out with something so clean cut after a solid decade of filthy, skanky scents and I think that’s my favorite part of this fragrance.

Unfortunately, its now being marketed as TM Cologne ""Come Together"" which is much weaker than the skinny bottle but I have to have a new one in my collection. The performance was way below than the original cologne and that affects the scent quality as well. To my nose, the original cologne was a little sharper, brighter and stays longer. Obviously reformulated. I could no longer find the skinny bottle on regular retailers or discounters. I saw it being sold at eBay for almost three times the price, than when I first bought it in 2017 for less than $50.

I like the OG’s use of neroli and bergamot, which I think give it more depth and nuance than Come Together has. In contrast, Come Together is simplified and stripped down, primarily relying on a squeaky clean musk to carry it. Longevity was fairly impressive--still detectable (although very faint) nearly 10 hours later. For projection, most of the wearing was intimate, as I only noticed arm’s length radiation for the first 2 hours. Compared to the new line of EdCs, though, something got lost in translation along the way-- Come Together only lasted a mere 3 hours before disappearing.  Still, for the asking price (nowadays), I wouldn’t purchase either--I prefer Sparkling White Diamonds as my “clean”/”soap” scent, *especially* for the value per mL.', ""After going through two decants I finally bought a bottle of this, and I think I love it more every time I put it on. Which is weird, because this isn't a scent that screams out to be anybody's favorite. But it just smells damn good. Yes, the soapy thing is true, and one of my decants (but not the current bottle) definitely reminded me of Irish Spring. But it's all good... I recognize that if someone described it to me as I am describing it, it wouldn't sound as appealing as it actually is.

It dries down to a gingery freshness, not utterly unlike Bergamote Calabria, but I think it\'s even better. Sure, I get really neroli...but I could swear there\'s ginger in here too. It\'s perfectly unisex in my mind (who cares though, wear what appeals to you). I don\'t see this kind of thing ever fading into antiquity, it\'s a timeless easy choice.

From time to time, I catch a whiff of it on myself - it's elusive like that.

Last night I put one spray on my arm (skin) at 10pm and today I can still smell it at 2:30pm wafting in the air after I just did a bunch of pushups etc. If I put my nose up to it, it\'s strong.

From more recent reviews it sounds as if it has been reformulated - what a pity, this was an incredible number! To those who complain about longevity: please note, this is a cologne not an EDP ;) ... and it was suave, unlike the many around these days.

I wish to God that there was a resemblance to Irish Spring but there’s just a boring, diluted coincidence to Green Tea. There’s a weird bitter base note in my sample also. I don’t know if maybe the juice in my sample turned or if that’s attributed to this scent in general. Nothing really special here to me. There are so many better alternatives on the market today for a “clean, soapy, fresh out of the shower” scent that have stood the test of time.

I have a bar right beside me and they smell nothing at all alike. Irish Spring is very green, a synthetic green, but green nonetheless. Mugler cologne on the other hand smells like neroli, bergamot, and a floral, orange musk. I probably should have expected as much given the note breakdown, but for whatever reason I was expecting the green, soapy freshness of Irish Spring. This does smell soapy and very fresh and clean, but not green or herbal. Mugler cologne smells like a more unisex version of my mom's signature scent D&G Light Blue. I gave her a decant of Mugler cologne and she loves it. It leans a touch more feminine than I'm used to; I wouldn't call it a feminine scent, it's firmly unisex, but don't be expecting a masculine scent like Irish Spring.

The bergamot is a prominent note, citrusy intense and sour; the neroli and orange flower are also noticeable, a white floral note, slightly bitter, with hints of orange. The petitgrain is noticeable as well, evocative of orange leaves, with a green touch. The white musk is the last and projecting note, this musk isn’t animalic or pungent, a very tone down the type of musk with good projection qualities and well blended with the citrus notes. The fragrance is relatively linear, the bergamot loses some of its initial sharpness but it is noticeable from opening thru the dry-down, also the initial strong projection takes one step down to moderate. Once Thierry Mugler Cologne has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a moderate projection, neroli, bergamot, and white musk fragrance with green petitgrain accords. The fragrance feels airy, casual, clean, cold, diurnal, fresh, green, modern, musky (white), refreshing, sharp, short-lived, sour, unisex, versatile, zesty and pleasant. BATCH REVIEWED: 2020. WOW RATING: 8/10. A very sharp, and sour, neroli, and citrusy fragrance. DISLIKE RATING: 1/10. The fragrance is very sour. UNIQUENESS: 5/10. The notes and resulting scent are relatively common.

APPLICATION: 6 or more atomizations. LONGEVITY (on my skin): 3/10. Low, about 3 hours, it projects for about 1 hour. SEASONS: Spring, summer. OCCASIONS: Outdoor gatherings, gym, office, vacations. This is an office-friendly fragrance.  VERSATILITY: 5/10. An ultra-fresh fragrance, although short-lived. GENDER: Unisex. AGES: Any. RECOMMENDATION: Thierry Mugler Cologne is a super refreshing fragrance but it lacks longevity. If you don’t mind reapplying frequently, it is a good scent. BLIND-BUY: Yes, but only if you are familiar with its main notes. SIMILAR: These are fragrances in the same genre.

I only smell it if I put my nose close to the skin. What\'s going on here? I thought this was supposed to be a great one...?

I can sense that specific hotel cleanliness in Mugler Cologne, but this Morillas’ composition is much more than just another soap. In my opinion, Mugler Cologne in among the best composition inside a very rigid, and historically important cologne genre. Other two compositions I admire the most are Vettiveru by Comme des Garcons and l’Eau de Tarocco by Diptyque.  Mugler Cologne is a fresh, extremely clean and genderless scent. The composition opens with strong citruses – piercing neroli, bergamot and balanced dose of chemically clean aldehydes. In the body there is a soapy note of white flowers, again a very clean bouquet. The base is made of laundry fresh musk. The special feature of Mugler Cologne is a clean, steamy note of hot iron. Like dressing up a fresh, clean shirt on a sunny morning. I believe that mysterious S-molecule is a Steam, not a Sex molecule of “post-coital liquids” what the rumors say. If you are looking for a happy, clean and reasonably priced cologne look no further. Simple and great stuff for a hot climates.  P.S. The retro-futuristic packaging is great, like a part of Captain Kirk's bathroom.

Being a big fan of 4711 I’d been looking for that freshness with longevity, this is it, but with a stronger soapy element. I have a bottle from 5 years ago, so not sure if it’s been reformulated. However, you can tell the structure is simple, so hard to imagine that would change in quality. Amazing lasting power for such a clean fragrance, Makes you smell clean no matter what you’ve been up to!', ""A few years ago Creed would send out free samples of their products. I was sent a small decant of Original Vetiver and on the first spray, I was in love. A natural and refreshing fragrance that makes you feel clean and sophisticated. It took me a few years to finish the small decant so I could not justify the price of Creed.  Mugler Cologne takes the place of Original Vetiver for me. It is more synthetic, doesn't seem to last as long, but still gives me that incredibly clean and fresh green profile I want. This is not a diss to Mugler Cologne, but rather what initially attracted me to it. Comparing the two, I see Mugler as more casual, which makes it even better for me. For the price, this checks the box for a beautifully clean and soapy fragrance, which is odd because it is also synthetic at times. It almost becomes a scent that is your skin, if that makes sense. It is light but bold at the same time.  I think this is a fragrance that everyone should smell. It is in its own world, especially regarding its history. Overall: 6/10 EDIT: The more I wore this, the less I liked it. I keep getting a sharpness from this the whole way through.  I actually sold it and have a bottle of my first love coming in (Original Vetiver). To me, they really don't compare in quality. OV is a lot nicer and richer on my skin, where MC lays sharp and linear. OV is just blended so well, it is impossible to beat. Personally, I would shell out the extra cash and get something I love rather than like.

Original vetiver has very noticable differences from this.  Neroli Portifino is a different smell all together. Your welcome.', ""Ordered from Amazon Germany what from the photo should have been the original Mugler Cologne and bottle, but instead I received the Mugler Cologne Come Together bottle. Unfortunately I was distracted and noticed this only after removing the celophane, opening the box, and seeing the bottle. Used a couple of sprays on me to test it, and also applied on a kitchen paper towel, and left it on a book that has a plastic cover. This is a test I have done repeatedly on many fragrances to check their longevity (among the longest lasting I've tested so far: Bentley Absolute, and Dior Fahrenheit.) I checked the smell on the paper towel for a few consecutive days. Amazingly, and to my surprise, I could still pick up the Come Together fragrance from the center of that paper towel after the second, third, and even fourth day. The vendor contacted me because of my negative review on them. And even if I had removed the cellophane and used a couple of sprays, they were kind enough to accept the return and offer full refund. Because of this, I removed the negative review. The wrong photo is still there on Amazon.de though, but apparently it's something they have already asked Amazon to fix, and it's on Amazon's hands for quite some time already. In any case, I then tried to order again the original Mugler Cologne from another Amazon market vendor hoping to get luckier, and luckily enough, this time I did the original and taller/slimmer Mugler Cologne bottle.  Now I did the same sort of test, couple of sprays on the center of the exact same kind of paper towel, and leaving that paper towel resting on a book that has a plastic cover. After the first day already, I barely can pick up the scent from the center of the napkin.  To me (again without comparing side-by-side, just from memory, which can be quite misleading) it seems to me the original is more natural smelling, fresher and lighter. Come Together might be longer lasting, but it seemed to me sharper, possibly less natural, more synthetic smelling. Take these impressions with a huge grain of salt, since I am doing so myself. Would like to compare side-by-side but haven't been able to do that so far. PS. Update couple of days later. Actually I can still pick up the scent of the original Mugler Cologne from center of the napkin. Still seems to me the Come Together was more noticeable after this number of days, but of course atomizer differences might play a role. Again side-by-side comparison would be ideal."", ""I don't agree with the Original Vetiver comparisons.  Tested the Thierry Mugler (OG formula) vs 2011 OV.. Mugler cologne is actually a bit soapier and smells nicer in the air. You can actually smell some Vetiver in the Creed. I would say they share neighborhoods but they aren't even on the same street. I own and like both."", 'Fabulous spring/summer fragrance for anyone. If you don’t like citrus/white florals you won’t care for it. However if your a neroli lover like me this is great.

Either way its a great fragrance at every stage. Very good quality and smooth smelling unlike a lot of muglers darker colognes. I get really good performance from this especially considering the type of scent it is. I think the s note is steam. It has a freshly steam ironed shirt feel which s lovely and clean. One of my go to spring scents. Citrus, soapy, grassy, musky, floral all wrapped in the creamiest cleanest vetiver.', 'Today I am going to talk about Mugler Cologne. A cologne, as its name indicates, very fresh and clean. Mugler Cologne has nothing to do with the Mugler collection as an aroma as it is the freshest of all and nothing invasive. It opens with a scent of neroli and bergamot, it also contains 3 more notes that I do not know much but I suppose they must smell very good because the mixture is really nice 😍 I always use it after the shower in spring and summer, when you need to feel fresh. A moderate sillage and longevidad of 4 hours or so. Its price is really cheap! I like it a lot!', ""Beautiful! I just tried this for the first time today. It opens with bergamot and a touch of soap and quickly dries down to a soft, grassy, vetivery dream.

It has a beautiful aroma and whenever people smell it on you, They wanna get closer. Beautiful fragrance."", ""Was looking for soapy/clean scent. Lots of posts mentioned Mugler Cologne. I smelled Creed Vetiver in store. Researched Creed Vetiver online and they compared Mugler Cologne to it. So, blind bought Mugler Cologne. Fits the bill. I have a sample of Creed Vetiver. I'm no expert, so the way I would describe the differences are that sniffing straight from the bottle, Mugler really smells like soapy water, while Creed smells only slightly different...like you can tell it's a cologne. When on my skin, the vetiver is slightly stronger with Creed, still soapy but sharper, while Mugler comes out just nice and clean and softer. Creed Vetiver lasts longer on skin but with the vetiver slightly more noticeable later, But Mugler was fine too...about 4 hours before became skin scent....sprayed some on my undershirt, and still scent on it afternoon at office. I also blind bought Al Haramain Portfolio Neroli Canvas. Also a nice clean soapy scent. The neroli comes out stronger on that, but it lasts longer than Creed or Mugler. The true-est soap scent between the three, to me, is Mugler Cologne....nice soft/fresh/watery/shower-clean scent. Some scents start out as something else, then in the dry down some people describe them as soapy. Mugler Cologne makes no bones about it. Soap/clean/fresh from beginning to end. I just wish it lasted longer. Funny comparison : I think you could spray Mugler on yourself 10 times, and people would think you are just really clean smelling and spilled some soap on your clothes, but if you spray Creed 10 times, people would think you showered, then put on a soapy cologne."", ""I smelled it and bought a bottle. I loved the freshness of it and find it unisex, I wore it a few times though. To my nose it smells mostly neroli with a thick oily smell. I don't exactly know how to describe this oily side :). It works best in very warm weather. Mugler Cologne is a taker if you want a fresh perfume in summer whether you're a an or a woman. This cologne made me then recognize the neroli note in perfumes, so I guess if you're a néroli lover, you won't get disappointed."", ""More than just soap! Mugler Cologne has plenty of layers. First there is a fresh, green, translucent neroli. Then there is a stroooong petitgrain, adding a sharp neon greenness to the scent. It almost smells like freshly snapped foliage. Green green green green. The drydown has the most captivating skin-musk I've smelled in a long time. It's almost like salty skin, very fresh and warm, but not like laundry or any generic soapy skin smell. Mugler Cologne smells oddly organic and real, which is unusual for Muglers as they are generally some level of otherworldly synthetic. For example, Alien's jasmine is synth-y, and A*Men has that rubbery asphalt. It's unisex, maybe leaning feminine as the neroli is prominent. The newer version does not last as long as my older bottle, which lasts all day long with a single spritz."", ""I absolutely love this. It's clean and fresh but definitely more on the masculine side. It's very green with a citrus hint and musk. Doesn't have amazing lasting power but it would be good as a gym scent or something to throw on after swimming maybe. Or just a nice summer scent on a really hot day"", 'The orange blossom is very evident and cancels out the bergamot, making the high point of the fragrance be the ability to isolate both aspects of the orange blossom, that is, the floral-fruity (neroli) and the most intense green (petitgrain). Unfortunately, however, for a minimalist fragrance with few notes, green and supposedly natural, the aroma is more artificial than it should be - even for designer standards, and this was clearly compensated by making it excessively soapy, which disharmonized the well-constructed orange blossom. Ppl say it served as the basis for copying by Creed with ""Original Vetiver"". Good performance.', ""My go to scent for dropping the kids off at kindergarten, it's clean and gets you noticed by the yummy mummies. Someone mentioned there's spunk in it, might point to the mummy chase round the kindergarten."", ""It smells like a lemony soap to me. It's clean and fresh. Not offensive at all unless you think smelling fresh and clean is offensive I guess lol.  Seems like a bright fragrance to me. It is a lighter scent and doesn't linger too long.

I can't stop smelling my wrists whenever I wear it. It might be the most beautiful soapy fragrance I've ever come across. It's so well done. The citrus isn't overpowering.

I’m not saying this is a bad cologne, I just think it has been hyped too much. If you want a good soapy smell, try Prada Amber Pour Homme.  Don’t let my review sway your decision, guys.

Also completely appropriate for gym or any other occasion where strong scents are a no-no.

After being unimpressed by A*Men Pure Havane and Pure Malt, in part due to seasonal inappropriateness, I can finally preach a little about something from Mugler I do happen to like. A quick note about my biases on Morillas -- I started with Acqua di Gio at a young age and I do consider him to be a superstar parfumier, to the point of his works being too popular to the point of unfashionability (sic). If Morillas did it, chances are, it\'s an over-marketed, over-hyped fragrance. Easy to steer clear of for someone such as myself, who is searching for fragrances that aren\'t very well known. I don\'t like smelling like anybody else. That is just me. Yet, enter Mugler Cologne, which I have no real problems with. It\'s a designer, yet isn\'t widely used, and the scent is very agreeable. The lore is cute and unpretentious and the result is what everyone tends to say it is: clean, soapy, mostly inoffensive, and easy to wear. It seems perfect for anybody who is restrained about the projection they emit with heavy fragrances, be it a personal choice, culture, or what have you. This is up there with Molecule 01. Not because it doesn\'t project, but because the scent itself is, as I said, very agreeable. Seems excellent for hot days, as I intend to be my use case for it.  To address the seasonality votes, or the rating here on Fragrantica, I\'d say Spring/Summer is spot on, and I do agree, such a simple scent might not ""deserve"" a 4.3, but I do think it\'s worthy of the hype. Clean scents are kind of underrated a category.  This review is off the back of my hand. I will know if the scent is intoxicating (in a bad way) if sprayed multiple times and for a day out in humid and hot weather.

The drydown 4 hours later finally gave me a soft clean floral and that made me happy. I could still smell it on my wrist this morning so longevity is good on me. It's sweltering summer here in Texas so I plan to wear this a lot. I think it's a good unisex cologne. And yes, I'm female."", 'A perfect hot Summer day cologne. Smooth citrus and florals. Longevity and silage moderate. Lovely after a cool shower on a hot day - like today here in Lancashire.', 'I received a healthy decant of this and went in with low expectations; hence why I am so pleasantly surprised. This is an extremely clean, citrusy soapy DNA. It has wonderful clean top notes that is your quintessential out of the shower vibe. I did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did. This is not a knock on this, but it has the same vibe as one of my favorite Summer aftershaves...Citrus Musk by Clubman. The dry down bring musk up to the forefront which added to the fragrance. Overall, extremely pleasant DNA you can spray liberally with. Longevity was about 5/6 hours before it came a super close skin scent. First hour had decent projection. My wife commented how great I smelled when I walked into the room. I voted “love” instead of “like” because of my perceived value here. For the fresh out of the shower genre, this is a HUGE value for money. It’s so inexpensive per ml, it’s hard not to own this.', ""I must agree with the last reviewer, Not worth the 4.28 rating.  I have it for 3 years but everytime I use it with hot weather, I feel sorry for wasting the oppurtunity of using a (much) better Neroli/Bergamot/(Petigrain)based fragrance. I have plenty of them and they are all better than this one. And if it is the soapy accord you're looking for, unless you have a magnified nose, you will be disappointed for there is none. Better go for a Acqua di Parma colonia. Assoluta,Essenza, Intensa. those are soapy. Or Prada Amber. If it is the soapy Musk accord that you like, than you really should try Kiehl's original musk. Also the performance is average at best, even for these type of fragrances. My guess is both Mugler and Alberto Morillas are both (highly) overrated."", 'nothing overly special just another freshie its nice clean fresh out the shower feel good vibes lay down and relax this is how this makes me feel :)', ""I don't know if this is marketed as mens or unisex but I'm a woman and i love this. Its an EDT but I find the longetivity pretty decent. It has a really refreshing smell with a slight musky undertone. A great summer day fragrance as it is not too overbearing"", 'I dont like Mugler. Angel was a truly disgusting chemical quagmire that sold on hype.There is a comment somewhere on Fragrantica from a young lady that says ""it smells like my local dump but I love it in a strange way"" That reminds me of the Danny Kaye film ""The Kings New Clothes"" Only the little child can see the truth. However I have to say this Cologne is absolutely fantastic. Apart from its gorgeous fresh grassy minty smell it evokes memories of going to the barbers shop as a child and smelling from the bottles of splash on that were fashionable in their day. Enough said, this gem is highly rated here but looks like its already discontinued. Its as scarce as hens teeth. If you can find a bottle snap it up. Why oh why do they discontinue Colognes such as this. It makes no sense whatsoever.', 'Just requested a sample of this from Mugler & was told that it’s now being called, “Come Together.” The bottle size is also changing to 3.3 ounces, so now you get one less ounce for your dollar. This company can’t seem to leave well enough alone when it comes to fragrances.', ""This has MINT as base note and still no issues with longetivity... Only mugler can crack this... Cologne stands different like other muglers... Opening - citrus-vetiver Middle - some floral comes Final- mint + vetiver+ floral... No Woody notes..no sweetness and very fresh scent lingers... Soapy ?  Yes surely...but we like the scent of some soaps..don't we? :)"", ""My favorite gym cologne - Irish spring vibe, sporty, grassy (but not sour), fresh, soapy clean, manly and versatile. Guys check this one out. They need to make a woman's version of this for feminine ladies that don't want to smell manly. Perhaps increase the neroli and add a touch of white floral. That would smell so sexy on a woman."", ""A scent with a proeminent unisex quality; A soapy base complemented by an all-encompassing green feeling, as well as the zestiness of fresh lime (bergamot).  This scent will make you feel fresh out of the shower, half a day long.  All that's left to do is know wether you like the soapy foundation or not. Projects for around 1 hour and then sits close to the skin for 4 more hours."", 'Influenced by my frugality, I was so excited to have many people tell me to try less expensive Mugler in place of Creed\'s Original Vetiver. Well, don\'t believe it. Both are ""clean"" scents, but the similarity stops there. You get vetiver with COV, not with Mugler. And Mugler suffers from weak longevity and sillage issues. Mugler is listed as ""...for women and men."" Well, here\'s some proof that Mugler is more for the former. After I\'d sprayed some on, my wife say,""I like that one. It\'s clean, nice."" I state I don\'t care for it and she chimes in, ""give the rest to me."" Done.', 'This is just so damn good it’s my girlfriends favorite and probably mine too. I love petitgrain notes, and with the musk mixing with the green petitgrain it reminds me of popsicle sticks after you eat the popsicle and smell the wooden stick.', 'Just a soapy, relaxed, soft (not very sharp) citrus fragrance. It\'s like a bar soap you\'ve probably smelled many times. Sounds cliche but it\'s the epitome of ""out of the shower clean"". It\'s a great dumb reach for the spring/summer. Great for casual wear and work. Lasts anywhere from 4-6 hours with decent projection for a couple hours.', ""Finally got my nose on this. This is the definition of a relaxed summer. It gives of that chilling vibe the same as Dior Homme Cologne and Ferrari Bright Neroli. Easy blind buy if you like these kind of scents. Cheap and a lot of value in every single ml. P.S. it reminds in a way a cologne my barber used to have in the 00's. Brings back a lot of memories personally.."", 'Smells very fresh, soapy and green. Similar to Philosophy Pure Grace, but more grassy and less flowery.

At least in the first minute I would be unable to tell the difference."", 'Just starting off by letting you know this review is from a woman who wears Mugler Cologne.  Mugler Cologne is the freshest, happiest spring/summer scent I\'ve ever had the pleasure of smelling. The opening is gorgeous and I could just keep spraying and spraying it just for the opening. It\'s fresh and so not screechy or loud that I can spray it all over. I spray it on my neck, hair, arms, clothes...oh dear lord I just want to jump inside a bottle of it!  Just for a short moment as the notes transition, it sort of has a bug spray smell. I was like, ""Whoa...hold up!"" I was getting worried there for a minute, but it gradually kept changing into a gorgeous green fresh cut grass with a tiny hint of musk and (I\'m sure) the S note. Beautiful! Just beautiful!  It doesn\'t take long at all before Mugler Cologne turns into a soft skin scent as far as me being able to smell it on myself. No worries though, I promise you will leave a trail behind you which is what happened to me. I had sprayed it several hours before I went shopping at a clothing department store and a woman sniffed me out from the beautiful fragrance trail I was leaving. She quickly approached me awkwardly laughing (thought I was going to have to do some judo/taekwondo moves or punch her LOL) as she said to her friend, ""I found it! I found the one who has it on!"" Then she said ""I\'ve been following this perfume all over the store. What do you have on if I may ask? It is beautiful!"" With my hand clutching my heart I breathlessly told her what it was (with wild eyes and a smile of coarse). I bought Mugler Cologne because of all the raving reviews but I was a little concerned about the weak sillage. I had just received the EDT only a few days prior to my shopping stalker experience, lol but I was thrilled to learn the sillage was good and people could still smell it around three hours into me wearing it.  In my opinion don\'t be afraid to blind buy this. Edit: My husband and I are now fighting over this bottle of Mugler Cologne.Haha! He literally hid it from me and I\'ve searched everywhere. He says I have plenty of perfumes...this one is his! I guess I\'ll be buying a new bottle sooner than I expected to', ""Holy bergamot Batman. Man this comes right out with a heavy sour bergamot note front and center. Behind that I get a green, grassy note. Kind of like fresh cut grass but I also got some in my mouth on accident. I'm not so sure about this one. So strange. I could see it being unisex, but I don't personally feel I'd want to wear it. Seems I'm in the minority by not raving about it, and I LOVE citrus. It feels more like eating the bitter white part of the orange than the juicy orange part. Perhaps I need to smell it on a clean man to truly appreciate it."", 'Any guesses as yo what the secret ""S"" note is? I\'m guessing it is a modern synthetic of some kind? Like Ambroxan, Cashmeran, Timberol or the like?', 'Smells like a good bar of soap. Very nice fragrance for summer. Elegant and natural smelling. My husband likes, my father-in-law likes.  Thumbs up!', ""Top cologne! Very good indeed! Intense fresh green soap followed by a humble vetiver/grassy dimension. The opening is like what many say...straight out of a hot shower; steamy, fresh, clean vibe. The drydown is warm grass on a breezy summer's day. Reminds me of the south of France. Robust longevity, sillage and projection - lasts 8 hours, projects well and no doubt lingers. Delightful!"", 'Looking forward to upcoming Spring to wear this green soapy fresh masculine cologne. Smells like you just freshly showered with Irish Spring Soap after pumping iron at the gym. Reminds me very much of a greenish scented shaving cream you get at the barbershop after a wet shave.

Smell is strong and clear from 3"" distance, light airy wafts from 9"" distance. T+20min - the bitter greens are taking on a slight soapiness. I wouldn\'t say it smells like soap exactly but I get the comparison. T+1h - still able to smell it very clearly from 3"".

You can smell the freshness, nearly basil... summer flowers...  Beautifully made. I get the similarity to Creed Original Vetiver, but it\'s different. Brighter and slightly fresher and warmer at the same time, but not sweet at all. Mugler is often in the spotlight for its Angel/A*men series, with which Mugler pioneered the ""gourmand"" fragrances. Too bad these are shadowing other Mugler\'s creations, and I think that this Cologne deserves much more attention given its singularity at that price point. A big weakness though: its performance. Indeed, after spraying, it quickly fades into a skin scent and will be totally gone after a couple of hours (I applied ~20sprays in double layer). I like it, but glad I paid just ~$60 for a 10oz bottle. Still, merci Thierry! All ages, summer days', 'Fresh out of the shower.

I was given a large sample from a Fragrantica member and have tried it a few times, and it always smells the same - so it has consistency on its side. The first few seconds of the opening are fresh and bright green, and then just after there is this note (is it the 's' note? I can't say) but it is so peculiar and sits right on that edge between pleasant and unpleasant. It's almost fruity, or more like over-ripe and bruised papaya + salt + human sweat + roasted seaweed + Vietnamese fish sauce. What makes it so weird is that it seems to affect the salivary glands - every time I'd smell this, like Pavlov's dogs, I'd find my mouth watering BUT this is an exercise in cognitive dissonance because the smell is NOT appetizing. It quickly becomes unwearable for me because it's so strong and so linear that it rises straight up to my nose and overpowers me. I'll certainly credit Mugler with creating something truly out of this world and chemically fascinating, but it's just not for me. I might go so far as to say that the cologne seems to manipulate me into a different personality when wearing it, and perhaps I'm not ready to go there yet!"", 'My take on Chandler Burr\'s S01E02 (which was Thierry Mugler COLOGNE): it\'s a scrubber. Major yuck factor in the opening. My very first reaction (posted at OpenSky in mid-July) was: ""ELdO SECRETIONS MAGNIFIQUES meets Tide laundry detergent residue."" It took me a few days even to muster up the courage to try it again, and when I did, my experience did not improve.  Based on my initial dislike, I guessed that it was created by Alberto Morillas, whom I affectionately refer to as ""Chemical Albie"" because he has produced a number of scrubbers--at least according to my nose and on my skin. It appears that we have a serious chemical incompatibility. But that\'s okay: there are plenty of other perfumers in the vast fragrance sea! What is so repulsive about the opening? Well, to me it smells like bodily fluids. Is it blood, spit, mucous, some kind discharge, perhaps even semen? I do not know, but reading that this composition contains a mystery ingredient, and being aware of the Thierry Mugler approach (ANGEL, WOMANITY), it\'s not beyond the realm of possibility.  The rest of the fragrance really smacks to me of petroleum-based industrial laundry products, with a strong, persistent residue very difficult to remove. I had to literally scrub to get this one off. Hence, the appropriateness of the term \'scrubber\'!  Needless to say, I will not be wearing the remaining 29 mls of my bottle of S02E02, but I enjoyed this little adventure. Bravo, Chandler!', 'While I love the scent, I find that contrary to what some are saying, it really DOES burn off me in under an hour.

Also, the bright green color stains like a BITCH on anything white or light colored.

From something grassy, almost like an herbal infusion, it shifts into a mate tea — minty and fresh. In the heat, it’s just perfect!

The first burst of fresh-brewed mate and citruses may hoodwink you into expecting another linear, bright-but-basic lemon/lime-green tea kind of thing, but no. There's so much more to it. Soon there's a bizarre swell of powdery sweetness, like an organic and wholesome sort of talcum powder, or a vintage lotion of some kind; light and wispy enough not to cloy, but so much more conciliatory and beauty-salon-like than the theme or the name might suggest. And THEN, just to bamboozle the nose a little more, while the powderiness hangs on, Act III kicks in: a far more bitter and herbal aura, with some ticklish, astringent tangs of peppery oakmoss and gooey-green galbanum keeping the botanical, real-plant feel going for hours and hours.  It really is full of surprises; I'd expected a much more minimal and strongly-focused story centred solely around the mate and nothing else, but no - this is a far more complex and historical story, maybe the tale of a kindly 19th-century wise woman who knew how to weave real magic from her herb garden. It is healing and clean and honest, but somehow also rather sophisticated and 'perfume-y' at the same time. Far more femme than I was expecting (that powderiness again) but would be wearable by anyone, and so winning it's hard to imagine any situation where it wouldn't work. A genuine quirky success."", 'This is something amazing! I looked for some spring/summer herbal scent, not a lemon-citrusy mess.

I can understand the soapy notes others are smelling, though I associate soapy smells with the more citrus-detergent vibe I get from some freshies, this is more of a \'straight after an ""everything shower"" using only high quality natural products I got at a maker\'s market\' soapy, like olive oil and clay soap full of herbal essential oils, and a unisex moisturising oil made by some kind local witchy lady. I am not getting yerbamate but I do get a smell of earl grey tea with lavender syrup and lemon butter shortbread, taken in the parlour of a mysterious and impeccably clean and well decorated estate, looking out the bay windows to the lawn which is being mown by a handsome stranger in a bohemian shirt and tweed pants using a quiet old mechanical push mower. I\'ve only had it on half an hour but I can tell from how it soaks into my skin and is already fading that it\'ll be a skin scent on me by two hours. I\'ll update this if I am proven wrong, and to state how long before it\'s imperceptible. I\'m extremely glad to have a travel size decant of this delicious concoction, but sadly I don\'t think I\'ll get a full bottle if the longevity really is so short. If you like the opening of this and want a more affordable way to get a similar vibe, sample Lush\'s guardian of the forest body spray! If you like the opening and dry down of this but wish they intermingled for longer and are willing to lose the powdery soapiness, try Andrea Maack\'s Coven. UPDATES: After an hour it is a barely perceptible skin scent of powder and well moisturised skin, it\'s giving \'clean baby\'. On clothes it\'s still there, green but not \'fresh\' green, more sour galbanum than anything else but I am starting to smell a tiny hint of the mate on the fabric swatch. I really like it actually, but it\'s not going to be a crowd pleaser. It is sour in an ever so slightly animalic way that I know is a very polarising manifestation of galbanum. After 2.5 hours it is gone from my skin and a barely perceptible hint of powder on fabric. However it did \'revive\' a little on skin after an hour to bring a touch of lemon tea back to the powder I mentioned at the 1 hour mark, so I would say you get a solid two hours from this. If it was 4 hours and the top notes lasted half an hour instead of half a minute, this would be an immediate buy. As is, this is a \'if we win the lottery and I have 100 full bottles instead of 5, I want it\'. I sprayed 3 more sprays when it wore off, to compare 1 spray to 3. All I can say is don\'t overspray this. Yes, you can boost the sillage, but that just makes the room you\'re in smell like clean powdered baby bum. It\'s not a compliment getter (\'I can smell talc in here??\') or a crowd pleaser, it\'s very much a for yourself scent if you like it. One or two spritzes is enough! You may need to reapply every two hours though. This is not season locked to the warm months like you might expect from reading the notes, there\'s something warming about the \'steaming lemon tea\' notes in the powdery rosewood drydown that evokes portholes rubbed into fogged up windows to peek out at frosty garden while cozied up in a wool jumper fresh out of powdery fragrant storage. I think this is a 3.5 season wear, not fresh enough for high summer in humid climates. Closing thoughts: this sneaky bastard of a fragrance sucked me in with it\'s powerfully vegetal bitter green opening and then it TRICKED ME into liking it\'s incredibly powdery, clean moisturised skin, unboxing a perfectly preserved vintage day dress, neutral floral musk. Nothing about that is up my alley. But I love this. I want to wear this to sleep. I want to spray this directly into my dresser drawer full of jumpers. I feel like an exquisitely handmade stuffed toy with lovingly placed dried flowers and baby powder in my stuffing come to life. Also, it lasts longer when you use more of it, about 3.5 hours and it\'s still faintly perceptible if I press my nose into the fabric. Still not very long lived, but more than the initial two hours from my very light initial application. Unisex/genderless scent but undiluted powdery notes do read as grandma to a lot of people.', 'Very natural beautiful bar of soap.', 'Regardless of the notes and few recent comments, I don\'t really smell those notes here. I don\'t understand how some people smell anything soapy: I have smelt soap in some scents but that\'s not present here, not at all. I actually expected this being much more green. But when I got my sample, my first reaction was: it\'s sweet! Oh dear, I didn\'t want sweet. But it\'s not any typical sweet either. Maybe ylang-ylang, lavender and powder make this sweetness (by notes). The sweetness here is mixed with certain bitterness. Replace this bitterness with ""powder"": that\'s basically LV\'s Teint De Neige. The bitter notes here represent the yerba mate although I expected a more true smell of yerba. Anybody in this site who actually drinks yerba mate has probably realised what an amazing thing it is to open that bag of yerba mate and smell the inside: it\'s so deeply green. I can even suggest a very specific one: La Merced de campo (and de monte too). Every time I open that bag, I smell the inside and this is most amazing olfactory experience itself plus also a time travel that happens then: the smell reminds me a childhood memory of an old schoolhouse that was usually painted before every new school year. It happened to be very dark green colour. Since my grandmother worked there and I was there in the summer time, I smelt that nitro-paint in many summers. And totally unexpectedly, the smell of La Merced de campo brings me back right there. I\'ve drank so many different yerba mate\'s over the years but this is the only one having such an incredible and deep smell (only if you keep the bag properly closed after opening, of course, like with every tea). Having now almost used the sample I think it is still an interesting scent to explore. I would possibly buy it if it was not so expensive. I also found, almost accidentally, that Mentor by Theodoros Kalotinis is very similar and this with no notes in common! :) So if you want a slightly more sweeter variant of this and also cheaper, try that. I\'ll compare more on that scent\'s page.', 'Powdery green soap.  Yuk.', 'Exact opposite of the previous reviewer for me: I strongly dislike the opening but love the drydown! The opening for me is sharp but soggy, somewhat of a antiseptic smell - a real struggle. If I work through it, in a hour I have a softly sweet green powder which is definitely my wheelhouse. For a better powdery green, try DSH Electric Summer.', 'Opening is great; very green and herbal. On skin I get lots of hay, but on clothes I get more mint and Galbanum. Settles down to something slightly powdery, slightly sweet with a bit of tonka bean-like smell(!). The more time passes, the more powdery it becomes, to the point where it smells like actual face powder(fond de teint). Love the opening, but not the evolution. A pass.', 'The very base has similarities to spice bomb. The top mugler cologne. Niche quality. Innofensive. Likeable. Clean. Understated. Classy.', 'Shampoo like, soapy, neroli, petitgrain, bitter green, orange blossom, musk. Calming, relaxing.', ""Soap. That's all that i smell with this one."", 'Yerbamate has one of the most realistic hay notes I’ve ever experienced. The opening is a beautiful mix of hay, green tea, herbs and grass notes. As the scent transitions, a powdery floral effect emerges; talc, mint and soft Ylang. I love this scent even though it seams to be short lived on my skin, a couple of hours before I can not longer smell it.  But for the time that it’s alive Yerbamate is pure bliss.', 'Powdery and green now that is a combo I have not tried before. I was really curious about this one as all the notes were just something very novel especially put together. I am not disappointed. This is super clean smelling, something you may find a really expensive soap to smell like, from a small shop in the south of France (Or in fact, Firenze) with handmade products. It smells like a fresh summer breeze, somewhere in the countryside, on a sunny day, with a freshly showered lady in a sundress walking by. The hay and the tea add a very soft green herbal vibe but none of it is overwhelming nor bitter I would say powdery is the strongest aspect, but in a very clean, linen dried in the sun summer green kind of way. Not crisp fresh, more clean fresh. Taking this one to my holiday in Tuscany it will be perfect for that vibe, with a linen sundress and a big straw hat.  ** 200 samples up for swap, uk only, check my custom shelf and get in touch! **', ""Yerbamate reminds me carefree summers in my grandparents' farm on nordic island, where we as children loved to sleep in the attic above the barn (there were no animals though). Especially after July when hay was hand-cut, dried and collected to big piles and stored in the same attic - we literally slept on the mattresses placed on top of this summer's hay. Due to the aroma of fresh aromatic dried hay and plenty of fresh air, the sleep in the attic was the most satisfying and energising I've experienced in my life.  As a regular mate drinker, and because of the name, I was ready for a bitter-dry mate-prominent scent, but this is not exactly what I got. Instead, a multifaceted summer memory emerged- its green, aromatic, very dry, but sunny, slightly powdery but nowhere near the powder bomb like Teint de Neige, and just slightly sweet. I'm not sure where the sweetness comes from, its not obviously floral, but has a slight touch of wild flowers, perhaps floral facet of lavender and touch of y-y... There is freshness despite of dryness and on my skin its not bitter, just very comfortable and cosy herbal aromatic. Very soothing. I can't tell all the green notes, apart from tea, mate, hay and mint, tarragon is very quiet on my skin, so are the woods, these don't dominate. But its interesting even exciting blend. Very unisex, less challenging for women than one might think, and very beautiful for summer, especially late summer days when its still warm and sunny. I gently disagree with the review below that says its old-fashioned, definitely not. But it is slightly classic-leaning, reminds me the greenness in Miller Harris Terre de Bois with sweetness reminding me cotton candy in TdB, though these are different scents, Yerbamate is also much drier. Still, I find it quite modern- its complex blend of dry green aromatics and performance will not overwhelm you, it'll be a very polite wear. As I said, longevity is only moderate and sillage limited. It's not the weakest performer, but I expected more, perhaps have been spoiled by aromachemicals that I can't smell much here... However, personally its FB worthy for sure!"", ""Someone on this paged called Yerbamate a green, more complex Teint de Neige, and I think they're spot on! It really is very green, with lots of maté and herbs and hay, but not as you'd expect: it's as far away from fresh as you can get without becoming overbearing instead. Because it's also creamy and slightly sweet and very powdery, and rather aromatic in a wonderfully unisex way (which is rare). It has a semi-gourmand side to it somewhere, but the overall effect is not edible: like old-fashioned mint candies and a powder puff deep in the woods. Such a riot of notes, but so well put together that the resulting fragrance smells obvious, as if it's almost self-evident that all those wildly different scents should be combined exactly like this.  It does smell rather old-fashioned; the kind of scent that could plausibly remind you of your grandparents (if they were a lot more elegant and surrounded by lovely things than mine ever were). But I like it a lot! Enough to regret that I only got a 5 ml decant; it's a little conspicuous, so I don't think I'd wear it to work or anywhere else it's unwise to attract that kind of attention, but otherwise I can imagine wearing it year-round. And as expected from this house, which always seems to deliver the very highest quality, projection and longevity are just right as well."", ""Ok folks if you want to know precisely what Yerbamate smells like, then please scroll down and read alphairone's review below. I did and decided to blind buy Yerbamate because it sounded exactly like what I was searching for in a fragrance. Well after buying Yerbamate and wearing it, I have to say that alphairone was SPOT ON in his description and analysis! If you like grassy, earthy, refined and powdery fragrances, then you will love Yerbamate just like I do!!! Thank you alphairone for your excellent review man and keep up the good work!!!"", ""Yerbamate opened for me with an intense baby wipe smell, which disappeared almost instantly, settling into a vaguely spicy but mostly powdery green scent. It was bothering me for a bit that I couldn't pinpoint exactly what the powder in this was reminiscent of.. but then it hit me: of course! It smells uncannily like my childhood plastic dolls. I grew up with an aversion to this strange, softly sweet plastic smell. This fragrance must contain a large amount of phthalates.  I also detect no mate whatsoever.. As a daily yerba mate drinker and enthusiast, this was an extreme disappointment."", 'The only perfume I have tried once in awhile for several years without ever getting a different impression from. To me, it\'s EXTREMELY powdery - vintage body powder - completely drowning out any hints of green, herbal or bitter that some people are apparently getting. It\'s strong and lasts days on clothes, many hours on skin, and again, I get zero development.  Take from (perfume-sceptic) friend: ""you smell like an upperclass old lady, very fancy, way too much"".', ""This is in a league of its own. The open is just extraordinary, a raw earthy greenness that is rarely captured in perfume as it is here: I can certainly detected mate and tea leaves, but there's also the most incredible smell of newly mown hay and the coumarinic aspects of cut grass in the summer sun. Delicious. After several minutes, the powdery notes extend the effect into a heart of lavender absolute and mint leaves. I almost feel like I detect cassie in the heart as well. This in time dries to a subdued vetiver, soft woods and moss. I very quickly developed an emotional response to Yerbamate, a nostalgic, wistful sense of comfort. I love when a fragrance can impart such feelings. It most certainly doesn't happen all the time. A truly personal, almost spiritual connection. My regards to Mr. Villoresi for creating this masterpiece."", ""Pretty much bought this off the review that said it smelled like matcha kit kats. I do see where you can get that, but it's not sweet really, and much much more powdery and hay/grassy green. It's not your typical fresh green or mate tea either. Imagine dry hay or grass-like smelling powder. It's okay, but not what I was expecting or hoping to get out of this."", ""I have owned Yerbamate for a couple of years and couldn't quite describe it until now. In the past several months, I happened upon a basket of matcha KitKats, which are now a bit of an obsession (I ordered a big bag from Amazon), sitting on the countertop of a favorite local cafe. A cafe where I happen to habitually grab an iced mate with milk. Yerbamate smells just like their flavors! Like a strong matcha latté with some bitter mate and nuances of herbs, hay, and cream. Add some nice classic powder, and there you have it. Aside from my constant thoughts of food, associations of which others might not have when they smell this, Yerbamate is a very elegant fragrance. I could see it as a signature fragrance to be worn daily. It's like a green Teinte de Neige, but I like it better because of its complexity--the bitterness, the creaminess, and I do notice a good dose of ylang ylang in the heart as well as soft spices in the base. Longevity is great, clocking in around 6 hours. Sillage isn't huge, but it does waft up to my nose for the first couple of hours before becoming more of a skin scent. A keeper.

Unlike its cousin-in-theme Duel, which features a wonderful mate note paired with citrus, Yerbamate is a green talcy scent that starts off softly herbal but not even close to the smell of yerba mate in any of its diverse uses.  You can think of most Villoresi fragrances to have a clear idea of this mix of herbs that he does so well, although here it is much subtler. The general feeling is of a fresh, albeit rich green tea with vanilla and hay that is quite original and easy to wear. I was expecting something greener with a more herbal drydown (Philosykos in mind) and this is my only personal complaint... it goes pretty fast into the vanilla talcy floral that we all know. However I love it and recommend it for everyone into unusual yet not weird scents for summer. It has great lasting power and ok sillage. Only word of precaution: if you dislike perfumey scents you better sample this first.

The mint completely disappeared on me, and after awhile the smoke got more noticeable, the woody resinous notes came in, and the whole thing became less sweet and just a little powdery. Really interesting fragrance to me, and definitely not the usual tea scent. It didn't smell anything like I expected based on the description.

As happens to many Italian fragrances, is too fresh and subtle, this lacks greater projection, but perfect in the rest. The aroma is easy to summarize: Yerba mate tea held under an aromatic smoke-perfect tone and a touch of very natural grass and achieved added to a fresh and floral background. Drying with woodsy facets and a mossy point that enhances the smoky facet of tea and yerba mate, exactly as if you were smelling the smoke released mate, the smoke from the ""la bombilla"" (container where prepares) this drink is popular in much of South America: especially in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.

This is perfectly unisex, by the way.', 'After having had a terrible experience with the beautiful complexity of Teint de Neige by Villoresi, I was very careful to approach Yerbamate. But my caution was completely unfounded. This fragrance is beautiful and left me pleasantly speechless. After all, for someone like me, greener, mossy and deep spiced concotions carry me to a a contemplative, almost melancholic mood. Saudade, perhaps? Or...wait...  Tarragon, mint and tea, which are already a feast for my olfactory senses. This combination is far more evocative than the name seems to suggest: smell of sun dried yerba mate carried by a wet wind on the border of a distant meadow. Bended, greasy leather horsery garments tickling under the weight of a sleepy ""huasa"". The effect is a bit puzzling: not too rough and not outrageusly ""healthy"" and fitty like many other greenish fragrances could be. On the other hand, rosewood brings softness and the citrus zestiness adds effervescence in the top notes. Wisely, top notes are discreet and well blended. And as I am always fascinated by different uses of lavender, Yerba Mate surprised me with an almost blue lavender note. It\'s a subtler and almost powdery-creamy, but a still recognizable lavender.  I do not know if in Yerba Oak Moss is still contained: it develops into the finest earthy note I ever smelt. Mossy, spicy, yet somehow elegant-floral and herb-rounded. And then, amazingly, I dive into the well know accord of citrus notes again. Something that I have already experienced at wearing Habit Rouge on hotter summer afternoons.  Yerba Mate reminds me a little of dried Ilex Paraguayensis in an elegant old drugstore with wood-paneled walls and drawers in which the herbs were sold openly. Such wonderful shops are still present in my hometown, Parma. An exquisite, almost eighty years old benedictine monk still runs a wood-paneled herbalist shop next to the Abbazia di San Giovanni. :) Anyway, Yerba is a stunning fragrance with a strong personality.', 'Combination of fresh mint tea, the mint combines with Mate to make place for dry earthy notes like hay, labdanum and galbanum but the minty notes will not dissapear.

And in particular, to me it opens first with the almost-freshly-cut grass, and then quickly goes to drier hay scent, like in a sort of time-comrpessing machine. Didn\'t scense much mint, actually.  Perfect for July-August, in my opinion. It is not sweet, but dry and non-intrusively herbal.', 'Yerbamate in essence : after shave + baby powder. Are you familiar with Felce Azzura ? The very nice powdery chypre body care line from Italy ? I love it and I found a lot of Felce Azzura in this scent.  If I should transport Yerbamate into a painting/photo it would read ""Man with small child sitting in front of a haystack.""  On me YM is partly masculine and partly soft as a baby´s cheek - so strange but very comforting and quite unusual. It has that dreamy feel to it. An afternoon in the countryside, birds are singing and the sun caresses your face while you are strolling around. My perception of Yerbamate seems to differ greatly from what all others smell or feel from this perfume. The reason why I now got myself a full bottle is that dusty, somewhat nostalgic aura that evaporates from Yerbamate. In a very positive way. This scent is old-school, like Carey Grant and Shirley Temple in one bottle. A hint of lavender, a tiny dose of oakmoss behind the powder puff, it all blends into something very peculiar. Along with Habit Rouge this will accompany me through spring and summer.

A surprising burst of the rememberence of these favourite sweeties without the actual overpowering sweetness of real boiled sweets.

A quick change to a long unfolding of mellow honey and soft flower petals with an underlying darker note that gives a little mystery. Yet neither floral nor sweet - I find it hard to describe this scent, other than it seems that so many of the notes others get from it are not the ones I find. It is delightful, elegant without being cold, assured without being brash or false, enfolding and feminine without being sweetly eager to please or fearful of being an individual. Not a scent for girls but one for a woman who likes who she is. I wish I could break this down into notes, which would be of more help to others. Yet to me, on me, this seems to have very little in common with the given notes or those others describe it as. Maybe this is one worth a try even if you are put off by the descriptions. It may be totally different on you too. I habitually turn to sweet florals, and bought this after a wonderful session with Les Scenteurs in London. I asked to be taken away from my comfort zone and I found Yerbamate. And while it isn't a scent I naturally would have turned to, I find it deliciously wearable.

Still, I find it quite modern- its complex blend of dry green aromatics and performance will not overwhelm you, it'll be a very polite wear. As I said, longevity is only moderate and sillage limited. It's not the weakest performer, but I expected more, perhaps have been spoiled by aromachemicals that I can't smell much here... However, personally its FB worthy for sure!"", 'After having had a terrible experience with the beautiful complexity of Teint de Neige by Villoresi, I was very careful to approach Yerbamate. But my caution was completely unfounded. This fragrance is beautiful and left me pleasantly speechless. After all, for someone like me, greener, mossy and deep spiced concotions carry me to a a contemplative, almost melancholic mood. Saudade, perhaps? Or...wait...  Tarragon, mint and tea, which are already a feast for my olfactory senses. This combination is far more evocative than the name seems to suggest: smell of sun dried yerba mate carried by a wet wind on the border of a distant meadow. Bended, greasy leather horsery garments tickling under the weight of a sleepy ""huasa"". The effect is a bit puzzling: not too rough and not outrageusly ""healthy"" and fitty like many other greenish fragrances could be. On the other hand, rosewood brings softness and the citrus zestiness adds effervescence in the top notes. Wisely, top notes are discreet and well blended. And as I am always fascinated by different uses of lavender, Yerba Mate surprised me with an almost blue lavender note. It\'s a subtler and almost powdery-creamy, but a still recognizable lavender.  I do not know if in Yerba Oak Moss is still contained: it develops into the finest earthy note I ever smelt. Mossy, spicy, yet somehow elegant-floral and herb-rounded. And then, amazingly, I dive into the well know accord of citrus notes again. Something that I have already experienced at wearing Habit Rouge on hotter summer afternoons.  Yerba Mate reminds me a little of dried Ilex Paraguayensis in an elegant old drugstore with wood-paneled walls and drawers in which the herbs were sold openly. Such wonderful shops are still present in my hometown, Parma. An exquisite, almost eighty years old benedictine monk still runs a wood-paneled herbalist shop next to the Abbazia di San Giovanni. :) Anyway, Yerba is a stunning fragrance with a strong personality.', 'Village behind Trees Paul Cézanne 1879', 'Natural greenish delight. This is truly unique. This is truly comforting. This is truly enchanting. My only complain is that top notes goes too quickly, drydown is nice but lacks that incredible greenish freshness present in the opening. If you want something that is really different, and smells natural, test it. This is perfectly unisex, by the way.', 'Yerbamate has one of the most realistic hay notes I’ve ever experienced. The opening is a beautiful mix of hay, green tea, herbs and grass notes. As the scent transitions, a powdery floral effect emerges; talc, mint and soft Ylang. I love this scent even though it seams to be short lived on my skin, a couple of hours before I can not longer smell it.  But for the time that it’s alive Yerbamate is pure bliss.', ""Pretty much bought this off the review that said it smelled like matcha kit kats. I do see where you can get that, but it's not sweet really, and much much more powdery and hay/grassy green. It's not your typical fresh green or mate tea either. Imagine dry hay or grass-like smelling powder. It's okay, but not what I was expecting or hoping to get out of this."", ""Yerbamate opened for me with an intense baby wipe smell, which disappeared almost instantly, settling into a vaguely spicy but mostly powdery green scent. It was bothering me for a bit that I couldn't pinpoint exactly what the powder in this was reminiscent of.. but then it hit me: of course! It smells uncannily like my childhood plastic dolls. I grew up with an aversion to this strange, softly sweet plastic smell. This fragrance must contain a large amount of phthalates.  I also detect no mate whatsoever.. As a daily yerba mate drinker and enthusiast, this was an extreme disappointment."", ""Soap. That's all that i smell with this one."", 'Powdery green soap.  Yuk.', ""Opens very green fresh and aromatic with a powdery touch As it's drying it's acquiring soapy qualities It dries completely clean soapy, still remaining green Reminds me of a washing liquid my grandma used but with accented green notes""]"

For sure it is a clean, basic scent, with little hints of citruses and flowers.

Cartier will relaunch it soon!', ""This is not it. It feels so contradictory because of the performance. The quality of the perfume is great! But it's instantly a skin scent, damn near nonexistent lol. Whatever great you can think about it, just add it instantly disappears afterwards. For me it, last a bit longer on clothes than my skin. One review below on here said it reappears like a silent whisper. that I agree. Im not lying when I say this goes instantly skin scent, almost feels like you're noseblind to it but then randomly it pops back up. Same reviewer also said you can smell it walking into a room. Surprisingly yes. If someone has this on and walk into the room the first time or you, yourself leave a room a room you were in for awhile and come back you will smell it. That is probably Eau de cartier at its strongest. Weird frag. Such a well crafted scent with terrible performance. Off that alone I'd keep it as a collectors item. Maybe this could work for young children since its light. Apparently people wear fragrances to bed, that could work. For this day and age along with the price, get something else."", ""Ahh, this fragrance is beautiful.  The opening starts off with this pleasantly sharp blast of Yuzu. Yuzu is such a unique citrus, and has a unique quality to it that stands out amongst the others. It reminds me of Le Jardin de Monsieur Li from Hermès. The coriander in the top also gives it a spicy pungent sharpness.  It's a lovely scent, nothing crazy but I do love it for what it is. This would be amazing in the summer / spring season. The biggest downside for me is longevity, which is not surprising with citrus scents. Overall, a very solid fragrance from Cartier. Bravo."", ""Cartier has produced quite a few beautiful fragrances to this day - and this is definitely one of them!

A couple of months ago, I happened to notice him and spray him with love! :) I believe that the same thing has happened to you at some point with another fragrance! It starts out very citrusy - but not like other similar perfumes based on citrus (Lemon) - rather bergamot in combination with Yuzu (One of the most beautiful citrus scents!) Very fresh and beautiful! The fact that I like the fragrance so much is the fault of the heart of this fragrance! Its evolution from fresh yuzu when the story transforms into a mixture of violet, lavender, musk... This is the perfect part!

My 10-year-old daughter first smelled tobacco in it, then sushi - definitly unisex notes..."", 'A clean, light EDC which is not long Lasting. Sillage is intimate. I can understand why Cartier produced a concentree iteration. Michael Edwards classifies this as a rich citrus. The citrus opening is very light but lingers for an hour or so. The violet and violet leaves are the essence of this perfume. I detect light musk and a more predominant amber. This is suitable for persons who work in close contact with others, such as personal services. Also good if you will be in close quarters for a social event. If you were going to meet someone for the first time, this would be a fragrance to wear, as it is quiet and unobtrusive.  I generally prefer more expressive perfumes but this one is very clean and pleasant. A safe blind buy, IF you will be satisfied with a gentle composition and poor longevity and sillage. One’s fragrance does not always have to evoke mysterious temples, woody forests or flower barges.', ""What a beauty this is! This has been in my collection about 20 years and I just never get bored with it. It's subtle but it's there, beautifully lingering from room to another like a sweet whisper. It's crisp and calming at the same time. Very high quality. I bought this one at Christmas time and every time I spray it, I feel the festive time coming. Such a kind and warm scent to me."", 'Eau de Cartier is a beautiful example of a scent of its genre - a light, unisex cologne best worn in hot weather. These vary in quality, ranging from the symphonic Eau de Guerlain to the watery rubbing alcohol that is Eau de Givenchy. Eau de Cartier is thankfully one of the better offerings. I had high hopes, as it is created by one of my top three modern era noses, Christine Nagel, but Cartier as a brand (the perfume line anyway) can be hit-and-miss. EDC starts off thin, even sharp, but mellows nicely as it progresses, resulting in a rather lovely violet-forward cologne.  EDC opens with slightly harsh citrus, given a dash of peppery spice by the coriander, which results in a slightly discordant opening instead of giving some warmth/aromatic softness to the citrus. I was ready to write it off at this stage, but instead, it turns around completely.  As it develops on my skin, a soft, slightly green violet note emerges. More leaf than flower, it is fresh and dewy - a real treat for this violet lover. Restrained lavender adds its typical aromatic quality, but manages to stay in the background, playing second fiddle to the violet. It feels relaxing and restorative, almost in the manner of aromatherapy oils, but EDC is still very much a tightly-composed scent, designed to be worn. The coriander complements this phase beautifully, adding a soft spicy lift - its appearance is simply premature. EDC features a generic drydown, becoming softly woody and musky, but the remnants of the violet and, to a lesser extent, lavender keep it pleasant. Sillage is intimate and longevity is reasonably moderate for such a light scent.  Perfectly unisex, EDC is an excellent choice for hot weather (also as an after shower/bedtime scent in summer). Elegant yet easy, this scent is a masterwork in the art of subtlety. If the opening was a little less harsh, this could compete with my beloved Eau de Guerlain for my summer attentions. 4/5.', 'Cartier have a good collection of fragrances  But this one is beyond good The citrus and spice as well as spicy florals such as violet and lavender  Make this one of a kind experience  What makes this scent a little bit better for me is how distinct it is which I can’t recall any other fragrances that are identical to it Performance is a major factor in loving a frag for me but this time it’s an exception  9/10', ""This is my bed time or after shower fragrance.

Wouldn't recommend."", ""Mmmm.... I don't like it. The opening is sudden and sharp. Icy spicy corriander with bitter bergamot. After 30 minutes the violets appear and the sharpness decreases. Nothing other than this. It is somewhat irritable to smell. And lasts short."", 'I’ve never had this experience with a fragrance before, but this almost smells like nothing to me. A slight coriander in the beginning, but dries down to invisibility.', 'Very safe, likeable and refreshing. This invokes the same feeling of being on a hill in the English countryside in mid June, where there are beautiful flowers like honeysuckle and heliotrope, there is a chilling breeze coupled with a perfect, moderate sun and you are surrounded by empty meadows of green freshness.  The texture is kind of dewy and watery which characterises the scent as a summer pick. It’s lovely but a little too forgettable because there is nothing distinguished about it. It’s very similar to Hermes in personality.', ""This used to be my go-to hot weather daytime scent but I think it's time to move on. I still love the cold gin & tonic opening but the drydown just sits on my skin as a shrill, bitter cedar that overstays its welcome."", ""The perfume equivalent of the word neutral. Pleasant, but not memorable. Dare I say, mediocre. That's not a bad thing per se, sometimes you just want something on for the sake of have something on, and for me Eau de Cartier is exactly for those occassions.

Is a safe blind buy though, if you are looking for something fresh."", ""This is a very wearable, cheerful aromatic that to my nose is very similar to Balenciaga L'Essence. The slightly sugary violet overwhelms the yuzu and citrus, which feel more like the base notes. It's a clean skin scent, feminine- but not too girly- perfect for summer. I would almost say you could blind buy this for a younger every-woman, it's so accessible. The downside is longevity- it doesn't last more than about three hours on my skin, and sillage isn't great either. But nor is it expensive, so it can be reapplied every few hours without guilt."", 'Very sophisticated skin scent.  A very modern fresh yuzu that dries to a white musk & light woody scent.  Elegant, Fresh and uplifting for daytime and hot weather. Well blended 👌', 'This is a bit nasty in the first 30 minutes or so, but it does have a nice dry down that is more lavender + wood focused. A decent cologne, more masculine than feminine. All together, not for me. 4.5/10', ""Modern skin scent, best on a sweaty-hot day (otherwise it's cold & sharp). The late dry-down is my favorite part; peachy-musky-ambery-sexy--it's light, but still evident at the end of the day, or in the morning if you wear the scent to bed. Strictly a once-in-a-while scent on account of the Iso-E-Super (two days in a row and I get sensitized, then headachy)."", 'I like complex fragrances. Those that take you down a meandering path or perform a couple of elegant pirouettes on the way to the to the drydown. Extra satisfying are those indecipherable ones that you mislead you to believe you’ve got them all figured out, yet still manage to play their trump card months after first spritzing them on. What a bliss! And then there are those scented waters that, without much (or any, for that matter) ado, cut to the chase: what you smell is what you get. In a sense I appreciate this sort of honesty and although I feel a great deal more contented when fragrances abstain from hitting the fast-forward button, there are several instances in this category worthy a sniff. “Eau de Cartier” is one such scent. Its purpose, it would seem, is to promote the concept of cleanliness entirely devoid of complexity. A silk-smooth ride down a straight path. Now there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that as long as at least a hint of thought goes into the creation of such a… non-brainer. “Eau de Cartier” is a delicate mix of citruses and herbs, resting on a sheer musky base. I suspect it’s white musk, which is one of my least favourite notes in perfumery. Fortunately, its presence is toned down here, so the drydown lacks hissy tones. Yes, there’s a trace of a laundry detergent, but it’s kept in check. All in all, the whole composition is quite pleasant and fun to wear though it must be pointed out its projection and longevity border on abysmal. Despite this, who knows, I might give it a chance next summer… just for the heck of it!', ""Classy, clean, fresh, green, bitter, floral, soft spiced. It's less masculine than Vétiver Bleu and Concentrée, but the spices and patchouli take over too much for me, it's not cozy and feminine enough to be really my style. For a violet fragrance, I prefer by far the cozier Marc Jacobs Daisy or the darker Lolita Lempicka. The sillage is moderate soft, it gets woodier after a few minutes. After 1-2 hours, it's really softer, like a faint blurry green woody scent. I could still faintly smell it after 4-5 hours, but not enough to really talk about it, I think the performance is poor. I got a sample in a Eau De Cartier vials set (the original, Concentrée, Goutte De Rose, Vétiver Bleu) that are a pain to use. Eau De Cartier is more wearable than the stronger and more herbal Concentrée, but I know I wouldn't reach for them so I gave them away. I don't think it's a blind buy, I would suggest to test it first, for the performance and scent."", ""I've been using this for years, but the recent bottle I purchased has zero longevity.

This is a ""stronger"" EDC, which I attribute to the yuzu and coriander notes.  The open is a lovely bitter yuzu note, which packs a punch that stays with you throughout the evolution of this scent. There\'s a hint of bergamot mixed in there which gives it some freshness, and a bit of spice from the coriander that makes it almost peppery and a perfect complementary note. I can\'t say this enough, it\'s an open you\'ll remember. The florals then come through, primarily violet and lavender, before evolving into a light cedar and patchouli drydown.  Cartier has taken your traditional EDC, added a spicy kick to it, and delivered a thoroughly original take on a classic citrus aromatic. That being said, if you\'re looking for the traditional EDC, look elsewhere. This fragrance is anything but traditional, and is in a league of its own.

This is a soft unisex fruity floral aromatic amber scent. It opens with citrus, fresh bergamot orange and some yuzu fruit. It\'s a pick-me-up scent to wear in hot weather to keep you refreshed. It\'s a bit like a fruitier 4711 or a more floral Florida Water. I thought with the name ""Eau"" (Water) it would be aquatic a la Davidoff Cool Water or Armani Acqua di Gioa/Gio but it\'s not. It\'s fresh as opposed to aquatic or watery. However it can still feel like something you wear to a pool, the beach, a summer seaside resort, and for a vacation or a cruise. It\'s soft and inoffensive, sweet. On me the violet and lavender really worked their floral magic. Beautiful purple floral scents of distinct lavender and violet. They turn more aromatic as the fragrance begins to enter it\'s dry down which is a musk and amber mainly amber aroma. Warm but soft amber. There\'s very little in the patchouli department except for the leaf note (it\'s a violet leaf note with green patch) and some woods at the end give it heft longevity sillage and all that good stuff.

I cannot carry the bottle in order to spray me every 10-15 minutes."", 'Not exactly truly original, it reminds me of a lot other perfumes I owned and liked, particularly of Shiseido Energizing and Omnia Amethyste. Also similar to My Queen Light Mist and the lovely Trussardi Jeans. Therefore, it does not exactly translate as masculine to me and I am the one who likes some masculine fragrances on myself. Despite these supposedly lacking attributes, Eau de Cartier stuns with its appealing simplicity, tranquil disposition and subtle elegance and makes for a great, wearable and adaptable fragrance. Airy, fresh yet warm scent with a main accent of urban yet rapturous violet and intriguing woody-balmy background complemented with a bit of zesty citrus. Good staying power as well.', ""The first spray of this scent is refreshing due to the citrus notes and then the dry down is a nice skin scent, but what happens in between with the yuzu makes it more of a 2.5 on a scale of 1 to 5 for me. Why? Yuzu to my nose has a fig note. It's not cloying. Rather, it's an oddly rotting smell that I detect whenever citrus and fig are blended in other scents and for some reason it is present in this for me. The only thing I can pin it to is the yuzu. I sure wish I could love it, though, because my bottle of Elizabeth Arden Green Tea Yuzu is also unwearable for me for the same reason. :/"", 'Spring in a bottle!!! :-) Powdery freshness that lighty flaunts it\'s floral flair. Unisex and uplifting all the way. This fragrance sings, ""I love Paris in the Spring time.""', 'I think the ones who posted negative reviews about this fragrance would need to take in mind that this ""Eau de Cartier"" in my opinion is a cologne to spray lavishly after a bath or shower, to relax and maybe getting ready to go to bed and have a pleasant essence while you sleep or after a morning shower in a regular day without the intention to impress anyone but just to feel comfortable and ready to do your errands in a weekend or a normal day at work. I think all the notes are well combined to give this sense of freshness and cleanness just for a peaceful night of sleep or regular normal day. I think Cartier has other fragrances much better of course more intended to impress in a date or special occasion, but nonetheless this one is a nice choice for those relaxing moments.', ""I'm actually very surprised to read so many negative comments on this poor little soul of a fragrance! To each his own I guess but for me this a great go to when the weather is oppressively hot. I've worn it for years in the summer. I also kept reading the word cheap, interesting because I always felt pretty lux wearing this one. I'm not big on separating notes from fragrances but I would say its definitely clean for those times you don't feel like wearing anything heavy. Natural and fresh is what I think and I do have to add somehow luxurious ??? I love it, it stays on for hours but extremely close to the skin. I get whiffs of it here and there as I move about during my day. I hope they keep making it and I would say, I don't think its as expensive as it used to be nor as hard to find :) Happy fragrancing :):)"", ""Was ever so excited to receive my freshly ordered package of the 6.7 oz of this scent. After skin testing it for a day here's my impression-- it's perfectly unisex. At first spray it's that lemon cologne blast you'd expect from an Italian barber-- I'm a woman, but I know that smell! After it settles in for a couple of minutes, the citrus morphs into a very distinctly aromatic almost herbaceous musky lime.  It stays there for a long time before slowly morphing into the more subtle violet leaf with just a touch of cedar, and then disappearing. I invested in this scent in high hopes of a more citrus/cedar/patchouli intermix, so I'm a bit disappointed that the cedar and patchouli are none existent to my nose. I also wish the scent was more long-lasting, especially for the price point its offered."", 'semplice ed elegante, questa ""eau"" che sembra già appartenere alla serie dei classici unisex senza tempo, è adattissima ai caldi giorni di scirocco come questo. le prime note agrumate (yuzu giapponese) sono avvolte in un morbido abbraccio di foglie di violetta che ne smorzano l\'asprezza. quindi l\'acqua si fa legnosa e leggermente aromatica, con accenni di legno di cedro e lavanda, fino ad arrivare alle note di fondo gentilmente polverose e speziate (violetta e patchouli leggero). l\'insieme è interamente giocato su toni gradevolmente lievi. come giustamente puntualizza un ""parfumista"" su fragrantica, un\'acqua eccellente che non passa per le solite, strasentite note di neroli. molto buono.', ""Despite the fact that I like Cartier, I couldn't understand (or appreciate) this one.

It opens with citrus and violet leaf, meanders past a little pine and vanilla, then settles to a very soft and very short lived neutral scent.  These basenotes are a little cleverer than they seem, as the musk is lifted and balanced by something green and elusive, presumably the violet leaves.  However, it is also exceptionally short lived. This perfume is pleasant enough, but I cannot for the life of me fathom why Cartier would make this the scent that carries the house name. It is simply not distinct enough, individual enough, to carry the brand.  Especially a brand that has created some absolute modern masterpieces of quality..."", ""Starts of with a bang of sweet yuzu, bergamot and lavender freshness with a hint of metallic ozone. Don't let this scare you, its actually fresh and exhilarating. It quickly settles to a nice slightly sweet smelling clean thats perfect for the office or during the day. While this kind of scent has been done many times, this one is nice. The dry down is a dry and woody violet, with barley a whisper of musk, amber and patchouli. Fresh and clean it smells expensive and sophisticated. Way more masculine than feminine. I scored a large spray for $28 on eBay, which is a steal. If you can get this on a deal its well worth it.

It must be yuzu that smells like yellow grapefruit. It's quite bitter, but that bitternes makes it interesting.

Its possible to pick it up so cheaply now I had to go for a full bottle.  When I smell this fragrance I get lilac with a hint of lavender. I know there is other ""stuff"" in there but it is so finely blended I find it difficult to pick out. Luckily I don\'t need to, its a lovely, sweet and fresh fragrance.  Its very light, especially after the first half hour or so, but it gently hangs around for about eight hours. I have recently started to appreciate the softer fragrances. They feel more suited to spring time and early summer than perhaps a heavy oud or leather. Its nice to experience nature\'s own best fragrances at this time of the year. I use three sprays to the body with EdC. After an hour has passed I tend to forget its there. Every so often throughout the day I\'m pleasantly reminded of its presence by gentle wafts of pretty lilac.', ""Well I think the opening of Yuzu is gorgeous.

It smells like ozone, coriander and eventually, very faintly of violets.  I put this in the same category as Maurer Wirtz 4711.

I can definitely see the appeal for very humid and/or tropical climates though. Perhaps in those temperatures this fragrance blooms into something more interesting.', ""As a lover of violet notes I figured I'd like this and approached it with an open mind as my first experience of Cartier had not been to my taste I thought it was quite a brave and classy scent for the right guy. This however is not really outstanding for me, it's alright though, fresh opening and you do get the violet note which is not at all intrusive or sweet but for me creates more of a soapy neroli accord. This changes into more of a recognisable violet smell as it settles on my skin after 20 mins or so. I get Cedar in there too which does complement the fresh composition all in all. I'll be honest it's a tad on the boring side for me but not unpleasant if you like this kind of scent. It reminds me a little of something like Mugler cologne but somewhat less green. I was thoroughly impressed by the previous Cartier fragrance I tried in terms of sillage and longevity which were both huge!

Finally, after weeks of use, it dawned on me; this was nothing other than eau de Cartier (or at least how I remembered it). I recalled how I enjoyed this heavily violet perfume. It was bright and fresh, sophisticated, yet had a casualness about it. Then I got pregnant and I could no longer tolerate these notes. I'm unsure if it was due to a body chemistry change, or my sense of smell, or my increasing sensitivity to scents, or perhaps it was a culmination of all these. Either way, I have been re-introduced to this scent. Although I wore it many times, I remembered how much more I preferred it on my husband. As a unisex fragrance, it is right on. It teeters the line between the masculine and feminine. For me, the sharper notes make this lean more towards a masculine scent. However, it is properly infused and softened by these great feminine notes. This fusion creates the perfect balance for the sultry, confident man. This is the type of scent a woman wants to wear to remind her of her man; very much like wearing his shirt, or spraying yours with his scent.

So you will need to reapply this. I usually am uplifted by this fragrance or if I cannot decide what to wear in summer, this is it. For something a little different I would buy this.

Very well made, smooth,elegant, with persistent sillage and longevity.  I didn't notice it when I first sprayed it on my hand, but when I put it on, it smelled somewhat familiar, like Prada Infusion d'iris because of its powdery note.

Bright japanese grapefruits (yuzu) with mandarin\'s sheer sweetness is simply delicious, but the complimentary note of corriander is sheer genius. The cool green leafy feel surrounds the citruses and does not intensify them, so much as embrace them. In the heart, the cool powdery beauty of violet is balanced by warm and woody lavender with the awesome thick and green feel of the violet leaves. I also get something almost ""peppery"" here, but it really works for a unisex scent. Cedar is the predominant note in the drydown (for sure), but it is not too ""woody"" as a light patchouli and smooth white amber (less rich and incensey smelling) swirl with just enough VERY CLEAN muskiness to make this one hell of a scent!

On application, there is a blast of sunny citruses, bergamot and yuzu lead the way, with coriander adding a nice spicy, herbal kick. The lavender in the mid-notes is pretty undetectable to my nose, but that is probably due to the double whammy of Violet - leaf and flower, lending this scent a sweet parma violet quality. The musk and amber in the drydown must be of very low quantities as i cannot really get a whiffter of them, but the cedar and patchouli add a wonderfully woody hint, which lasts long after the top notes have faded. The patchouli and cedar are also responsible for keeping this fragrance in Male/unisex domain (although i think the average (non-parfumista)woman would probably choose a more feminine scent over this) Without those two notes in the dry-down, this scent would probably be alot sweeter, what with the abundance of violets and citrus fruits, thus makingg it more female friendly. I,for one am glad of the woody basenotes, as the whole composition melds together so well to create a refreshing spring and summer tonic for you to spray to your hearts content with. This fragrance is a personal favourite of my mums, she says it is so uplifting and boosts the mood. Pity that it just doesn't seem to hang around for very long. xxx"", 'When it comes to Eau de Cartier (edt), my nose goes deaf and blind. After the commonplace citric opening I feel nothing. Once the top notes evaporate, the fragrance goes blank on my skin. I reapplied it several times to face the same effect – as if I were wearing no scent at all. Then after a couple of hours a faint amber and musk base appear (to be detected only with a nose pressed to the wrist).  I so much wanted to love this fragrance. I even considered a blind buy (fortunately, I bought a vial sample for a start). Alas, on my skin this is a dull echo of a scent. Disappointed.', 'Eau de Cartier ""Elegant and neat for the office, daytime wear, it radiates confidence."" The compliments I get always makes me feel wealthy ..healthy .. and wise!', ""For those that love refreshing citrus-based fragrances with that slight masculine touch - Eau de Cartier is for you. I'm not a big citrus wearer. I prefer to smell it on others rather than on myself. However with that being said, Eau de Cartier is certainly lovely and fresh. Perfect for a hot Summer's day. The yuzu is an interesting note. I first experienced it in Incanto Bliss by Salvatore Ferragamo, which I think I liked simply because of the yuzu note. So for those that aren't too thrilled with citrusy scents, do try something with yuzu in it and you may be pleasantly surprised. Eau de Cartier is one of those everyday type of scents. On the skin it feels clean, subtle and comforting.  In some ways Eau de Cartier reminds me of Light Blue by Dolce & Gabbana. Possibly because of the citrusy opening and the cedary drydown. I do however love the patchouli note in this fragrance. It is spicy, earthy and delightful. I did try to love this fragrance, however the masculine citrus note got in the way of that full-fledged love. The lasting power was rather weak as well, which only left me bitterly disappointed. However, as I mentioned previously, both men and women alike, those who love citrusy scents, will most likely love the classy Eau de Cartier."", 'The scent is good...sweet/sour type of scent, but for a longer lasting/better scent, I found you can blend this with, Clean Men, and it smells great', 'An absolutely perfect perfume.

Instead, I find the dominant and persistent notes, curiously enough, to be coriander and a je ne sais quoi note--what I presume (ignorantly...) is yuzu? But the cedar-amber-musk-light patchouli amalgam in the drydown comes quickly enough to make this a quasi-linear scent. Other reviewers have spoken of yachts, of which I unfortunately have no experience, but I do get the feeling of walking along the piers of a northshore town, perhaps Dunkirk, as this fragrance seems warm yet cool all at the same time--something like the feeling of a light mist of sea spray that has dried on one's face in the sun. True to its intended market, EAU DE CARTIER is a unisex fragrance, with all that this implies, above all, a savory, even salty, rather than sweet or heavily floral demeanor.

The quality and elegance of this scent are evident from the very first spray... The opening on this is simply amazing! Bright japanese grapefruits (yuzu) with mandarin\'s sheer sweetness is simply delicious, but the complimentary note of corriander is sheer genius. The cool green leafy feel surrounds the citruses and does not intensify them, so much as embrace them. In the heart, the cool powdery beauty of violet is balanced by warm and woody lavender with the awesome thick and green feel of the violet leaves. I also get something almost ""peppery"" here, but it really works for a unisex scent. Cedar is the predominant note in the drydown (for sure), but it is not too ""woody"" as a light patchouli and smooth white amber (less rich and incensey smelling) swirl with just enough VERY CLEAN muskiness to make this one hell of a scent! Cartier sould make a watch with one number on it and the most plain band and face and it would STILL be stunning; THAT is what they have done here.

I think all the notes are well combined to give this sense of freshness and cleanness just for a peaceful night of sleep or regular normal day.

For a violet fragrance, I prefer by far the cozier Marc Jacobs Daisy or the darker Lolita Lempicka. The sillage is moderate soft, it gets woodier after a few minutes. After 1-2 hours, it's really softer, like a faint blurry green woody scent. I could still faintly smell it after 4-5 hours, but not enough to really talk about it, I think the performance is poor. I got a sample in a Eau De Cartier vials set (the original, Concentrée, Goutte De Rose, Vétiver Bleu) that are a pain to use.

Mixes well with a rose lotion if you want to girly it up a bit. Personally? I wear it over a deep patchouli lotion which helps it hang around a little longer.  Amber is a big star in the drydown. EDIT- the ingredients list vanilla but I don't get any sweetness from this scent, so if you want to give it a gourmand flare, try layering it with Turmeric Latte by Lush. It mixes seamlessly.

Just enough zing from the pink pepper. IMO, this is very unisex..leaning masculine,but somehow it still works for unisex.I enjoy this more than Ambre 114 and/or SL Ambre Sultan. And it is not as cloying as Mugler Alien Absolute(thank God..). In the drydown,this does ""sweeten"" up a bit on my skin. The first spritz comes off as harsh at first. This is another one that you have to let ""live"" on your skin and with your chemistry to fully ""get it"". Good stuff !!!!!', 'What a surprise! I was expecting a well behaved amber (like HdP 114, or Saab Ambre n.3). And no! On my skin, it opens very masculine, with a blast of bitter orange. Shortly after it goes on the ""dirty amber"" side, with animalic spices (cumin and carraway probably), as well as an earthy patchouli. The drydown is less unique, developing the typical sweet powdery resinous vanilla - typical of amber fragrances -, leaning unisex (maybe a bit feminine). Unique opening (A+), and classic drydown (B). This gets an A-. Final grade: Love, but misses the masterpiece honor list for some reason. Colder days, 20+', ""This is so unique, and yet so pleasing at the same time. It's the opening that's the most challenging for sure. The opening is a blast of strong, animalic, dusty amber, with a bit of patchouli, I think. That hangs out and just naggs at my nose for the next hour or so until it starts to dry down to a beautiful spicy vanilla.  I adore Dame's Black Flower Mexican Vanilla, but now I'm not sure which is my favorite spicy vanilla. The Dame doesn't have the animalic, but then again, the animalic doesn't last especially long. Both are stunning vanilla scents. Not dupes, just kinda in the same category."", ""For me the opening is juicy and sweet. It's not exactly masculine to my nose. I don't get anything dirty or animalic either. After the juiciness passes it turns medicinal before going to dried orange, dry mild spices, and a dry grass scent (patchouli is that you?). The extreme version is less powdery than the original. I've got a small bottle and I treasure it. <3  Edit Jan 2020 I gifted my 30ml bottle to my mom. -"", 'All I get is strong amber. Very deep. To my nose It’s similar to Shalimar without the leathery incense that turns me off. This will be great during winter. I’m not usually a huge amber fan but I was drawn to this one and just had to have it. A great addition to my collection. I’ll use this to layer with others to make my other scents more fall/winter and deeper and darker. Interesting scent. It’s not my usual choice but very nice.', 'A dry patch immediately turns to a balsamic-mentholated heart (nutmeg? mate?) and then it settles on a drydown of slightly powdered amber-patch combo. Vanilla is not synthetic or sweet but gives it depth. An all-seasons perfume. Beautiful, comfortable, best powdered amber.', ""Big blast of spices, something earthy, herbal, clove, cardamon, cinnamon, pepper, and a touch of mint. Amber is there but more in the background than is ideal for me. Nutmeg, patchouli and Turkish rose according to their own webstie. But i think there's some hay / some kind of herbs too. Definitely more fresh spicy category than balsamic. Update: Drydown is a lovely complex(ish) amber. I'm actually impressed with the drywdown which is rare. But won't be on my buy list because you have to endure about an hour of hay / medicinal / spicy first..."", ""A blind buy but I am glad that I bought it. I got this about half a year ago but at that time I thought the spice is too strong and it was a bit over for me so I seldom used it throughout the whole winter. However, for the past few months, I am obsessed with amber and I tried this on again and was amazed by its performance on my skin. It is an amber fragrance with a touch of vanilla that makes it warm and comfortable, while at the same time the spiciness makes it special and unique, leading it a bit towards the masculine side though it's still a unisex fragrance. In the opening, the spice is not so strong but at some point later (like 1-2 minutes or so) there is a sudden blast of spiciness. After that, the strong spicy scent fade again although it is still noticeable under the warm comforting amber vanilla aroma which I like more. I know the process sounds a bit weird but that is what I detected on my skin. Probably others may smell something different. After all, fragrance and scent are a subjective thing and the chemical of everyone is different. Now it becomes my top 5 favourite amber fragrances. P.S. I can smell a soft incense and patchouli as others mentioned before. Plus I don't know why this scent does not project very well either on my skin or clothes except for the first few minutes when the spicy note is still strong. Later it becomes like a warm skin scent with a touch of sweetness which I love so much, ."", ""I love to spray amber and woody fragrances in autumn and winter so I bought this a few months ago online. It was a blind buy and it was also the first perfume I bought from this brand. I read the reviews and believed that I would like the smell and it did not disappoint me. I couldn't wait to open and tried it on when the perfume arrived and I was deeply in love with it. It is a spicy woody scent in which amber is very obvious as well as the spicy notes. They are well blended and you cannot really separate them. I mean, you can distinguish there are amber and spicy notes, but in one sniff both of them come into your nose simultaneously as a blended woody spicy scent. This is not always the case when it comes to fragrances. There are some scents that you catch the most obvious notes in the first smell(usually notes that your nose and your memory are more sensitive and familiar with) and some other less predominant notes in the second sniff, and probably some minor notes when you take a deep breathe. Whereas in this one, all notes appear in a single breathe, probably because of its simplicity in ingredients, though simplicity does not necessarily mean mediocrity. Its vanilla is very soft so do not expect it to be a sweet and warm woody scent that normal vanilla perfumes would be. I can notice vanilla in the scent but it is neglectable. It just gives it a base not so spicy and with a tiny hint of sweetness. Sometimes perfumes have a quite different opening and set down but this one smells literally all the same at any time. Its spicy notes are heavy so it does not seem like Dior ambre nuit, which is my favourite amber scent. But I do think it is a bit similar to Ambre Imperial by Van Cleef & Arpels. Anyway this is a good amber fragrance and I do not regret buying it."", ""I love it. Love! One of Jean Claude Ellena's best. Its a really clean and fresh smelling amber, with a little bit of a spice kick.  I'm jealous of anyone who gets more than 3 hours out of this amazing scent. I have gotten many compliments from wearing this masterpiece. For cold Winter days and nights."", ""One of the BEST ambers on the market. I like the other amber but this one is totally fantastic. I am an amber girl and I totally love this, it's a spicey amber, well balanced and last a good while on your skin and or clothes. Highly recommended."", ""Golden-syrupy cardamom, cinnamon, and mace. Patchouli! Rose, nutmeg & further florals, dusted in powdered vanilla. Increasingly cool Autumn nights in London lent the setting. At the time I found it powerful & pleasing yet mildly putrid - which only added to its exotic, fleshy, sweetly stewing vibe (there's surely some latent animalic essence deep whithin) attempting to gel with AE, I wore it on & off for a year or so. I loved this - then went off it, and in a wardrobe weed gave away a near full 100ml a year ago. Although it's not an 'any season' scent to be sure there are times when it's just right - hoping the one I gifted it to has a better relationship with it than I did. Perhaps I should go with the ball or la bougie? ★★☆☆☆"", ""After purchasing this blind, I'm pleasantly surprised. It's youth dew meets obsession, meets vanilla incense. I love it. I have to say I get the 1920's. The spice is apparent immediately. Morrocan spice comes to mind. It makes me feel exotic and wealthy.

Maybe Artisan L'eau d'Ambre?  This has heavy room-filling sillage on first spraying - I can actually smell it downstairs at the BACK of the house now, having sprayed twice on the dress I am wearing to work tomorrow in my bedroom upstairs at the FRONT of my house (I normally do this to my clothes in the evening). I don't live in a mansion, but it's not a tiny cottage.  Longevity is at least 8 hours on skin and survives a shower; I am not sure about clothing, but it's going to be days, I think.  I also sprayed this on one wrist yesterday evening and Ambraliquiquida L'Erbolario on the other; they are both warm, spicy, powdery ambers with similar sillage. LOVE them both (the AL'E is sweeter and sharper, I think)."", ""Plastic? Fantastic and TRUE review by @nickyt99. At start it is Shalimar holding hands with Labdanum 18 on steroids, then Heeley's Cardinal sways the incense barrel. Powdered ladies sit in the first row.  It lingers I tell you, wait for it. It surrounds you so nicely, I feel this is my mini-me in a pile of kid's toys. I'm on a rocking chair telling stories of good times. EDIT: Now let's get serious, I learned amber is something noses have to recreate. This amber is made of ROSE. It's a prominent, blooming, velvet rose, which is stunning. But folks, it contains PATCHOULI. Why isn't that listed here? This bitter note appears in the very end of the dry-down, and I feel kind of let down. Not knowing where to go with that bad after-taste that marks everything I touched during the bloom of this rose. For days. My deer surrounding is not pleased: From 'sophisticated’ which I guess is nicely said for 'weird’, to ‘organic shop’, to letting collegues sniff a jacket that I touched once (it was a hug) in order to share the flabbergasted sensation. Uff Stunning quality and out of this world smell, that has a touch of horror."", ""Ambre Extreme is my favorite amber. Warm, dusty, vanillic, and velvety. I'm finding it very comforting and yummy on a cold day. It's cozy, yet at the same time there is something unsettling or bothersome about it. Like a purring cat snuggling with you and occasionally stretching its claws out into your skin. Maybe it's the spice, which, if I were to try to name it, would be cardamom. Ambre Extreme sits somewhat close to the skin, but with heavy application and body heat could extend a lot more. It's a perfect antidote to a bitter winter. Edit: On a warm day, this completely blossomed on my skin. It became quite alluring and decadent!"", ""L'eau D'Ambre Extreme edp is the one I own and if my favourite perfumes had the tenacity of this, I would be a very happy camper. I sprayed liberally over 14 hours ago and because I couldn't smell it I had another couple of sprays a few minutes later. Big mistake. This one just grew and grew. At first I enjoyed the spices and what for me was a mild incense, nothing too overpowering, quite enjoyable really. Until I got to work and it began it's drydown phase. Well, if I could have moved away from myself I would have, believe me! The spices and incense did!  What I was left with was powder. A kind of heavy, earthy, almost musty powder that the heat in the building just reacted badly with and powder seems to be a facet of perfume that works against me.  So when I finally got home from work I considered a quick shower but being lazy I thought a few squirts of something more agreeable would suffice. Not on your Nellie. I'm in bed now and I'm still being slapped around the face by this one. And what's worse, I wear a uniform in work so guess what I'll be smelling all day tomorrow too.  On a serious note, this has excellent longevity and it's not the first time I've had an issue with powder so I know it's me and not the perfume. Give it a try before you buy and if it works with you you're going to love it's staying power."", ""Almost posted here hastily, to say I think L'Eau D'Ambre is better. While L'Eau D'Ambre is probably cosier and softer slightly, Extreme has morphed into a sugary pink musk stick and I am totally fine with that. Also, it doesn't have any of that pesky patchouli that goes a bit dirty on me, like the other one. Yay!  Win!

It is very confusing.There are L'eau d'Ambre Extreme ( guess it is this one here?) and older L'Eau d'Ambre."", 'Ambre Extreme is a unisex fragrance.  It resembles Amber in a good way.  It´s sweet, sugary, powdery.  The name Extreme says it all.  6 sprays last and project on me for over 12 hours.  The first hours are supplied with a very good sillage (the smell when you pass a room). Powerhouse niveau. A very good, sweet Amber fragrance for the night out. It smells to me like a cake! By the way it´s not as spicy as Ambre 114 (the brightest Amber fragrance so far), so may be less masculine for some. I would rate it more towards feminine side, but I like to wear it myself, because it´s definitely unisex.', ""I usually am not a huge fan of L'Artisan, but this amber is very nice. Simple but complex feeling to my nose. I cannot believe the chart about states that the sillage is basically a skin scent. From the initial spray and about 15 minutes afterward, is quite wide. I'll update if an extreme (ha ha) difference happens after an hour or so. By the by....a very nice amber. Nothing will ever beat Serge Lutens Amber Sultan for an amber fragrance.....EVER.

The perfect autumn comfort scent!', ""D'ambre Extreme Review I love amber fragrances, with my favourite being Amber Absolute by Tom Ford. When I was first about to spray D'ambre Extreme, I was expecting a similar church scent, though perhaps not as overpowering as Tom Ford's effort... I couldn't have been more wrong! Let's get the elephant in the room out of the way first - this is most definitely a unisex fragrance. I have no idea why this is listed as only feminine as it is far too good not to share with the males of the species.  This starts with a warming amber glow that merely touches upon the dry side before mellowing out to a wonderfull comfort scent. Now, the way I'm going to describe this may put some people off, but I urge you to at least sample this fragrance. Once this fragrance mellows, you are introduced to the love child of Pledge furniture polish and WD40. I cannot explain this any other way, and can only add that I adore this fragrance. Its smooth warming nature simply envelopes you like a cashmere blanket. Given time the amber resurfaces in a sweet, church-like fashion - again not too dry. The drydown brings out a slightly too sweet vanilla skin scent, but one that I can't get enough of. I am still able to easily notice it over 8 hours after application. Admittedly, over exposure can be a little heady, so I would keep it to two squirts maximum.  Definitely one for the Autumn and Winter, though I feel I will be wearing this throughout the year.

This is one which has that sensual, real dry amber smell which you find in incense fragrances. It really reminds me of amber incense.

The amber is present throughout the composition, from the first spray in fact. I can\'t pick up the different spices but to me it almost has an aspect of cumin or black pepper in the background. There is something dry and aromatic also, like an aniseed or cardamom vibe, but I can\'t be sure exactly. Overall, I would recommend this as something which can be layered with other ""oriental"" fragrances. It has good enough performance and longevity to be worn on it\'s own too.

The powderiness reminds me of vintage Habanita. I don't find this spicy or sexy or exotic at all, it feels a bit musty and traditional. Maybe this sounds like a negative review, but I swear, it's not! I love this. It's home, with the smell of baking vanilla in the kitchen drapes, with dust in the rugs, fall leaves on the porch, and potpourri on the cedar sideboard. It's where I grew up. It's nostalgic and haunting and emotional."", 'Ambre Extreme is still a fave of mine and more than in the past. I have my own bottle from many years and it still smell very fresh, so I\'m not aware of any current reformulation. It used to smell too powdery and strong for my nose, yet beautiful. I preferred L\'Eau d\'Ambre, but these days l\'Eau d\'Ambre smells too soapy and dizzling to me, while Ambre Extreme is totally luscious! As always with ""amber"" it has to be taken in poetical way. If there is any true amber here, I doubt, but the whole blend smells of heavenly ambery clouds, so at least it is well crafted ""amber"", quite different if compared with your average amber from drugstores. The powderness smells natural and not sybthetical. This is a scent that needs a warm skin to develop completely. Mine is not warm at all, so it stays a little cold sticky, but enfolds along the hours. It is spicy, indeed, but not nostril-piercing like many spicy orientals. It smells like sweet spices, something you would add to dessert. Vanilla is especially lovely here and gives roundness to Ambre Extreme, so that it continues to mingle with your skin and being sweeter with hours. I once met a person who wore this one divinely and I found myself going behind and smelling her like a dog! I\'m not generally a fan of L\'Artisan now. i\'ve been for a while long ago, now I feel they are not always top quality, but Ambre Extreme is a winner and especially cosy in winter.', ""Ambre Extreme is much more spicy and punchy and a slightly deeper, more iridescent amber than the original. This takes the sharper qualities of the first kind and enhances them, smoothing them out and amping them up. Where the original is more powdery after a while, this is spicier all the way through, which is why it is 'extreme' - it definitely lasts longer in its original spray scent, which I love. It's seductive, mysterious, it's like a conversation on the skin and around the person that you don't wish to end. It is one of those perfumes that begs to be intellectualised, but also to be taken pleasure from. It's inviting and exotic and masterful. The vanilla and the amber are perfectly interwoven, and together loan the impression of a faraway, magical destination. At once it is sands and a gypsy bazaar in a remote desert where unusual instruments are played and beautiful and rare antiques are for sale.... there is an antique feeling to this fragrance indeed. Dusty, secretive, enticing. Then you have a quality of cosmopolitan chic. Sophistication and quiet glamour. It's a marvel! The lasting power I will have no question about as I can't imagine it would change too much. The sillage is ambient. It's a gorgeous scent, it really is. If you are a true lover of ambre, and don't mind a touch of a gourmand, creamy note (which is slightly caramel) this would be your first choice. The intensity is also perfect for an ambre, which should be lasting and deep. This is such a yummy perfume and a wonderful addition to any closet, enhancing any outfit or mood. It would come alive in fall and winter for sure, but in summer it is balmy and earthy and sexual."", ""This perfume was in a tester set from L'Artisan Parfumeur, and since I love amber scents I was eager to try.  It's a true amber, warm and and powdery, but in a very 70's way. It's not at all spicy on me, just very linear amber. It doesn't develop at all. Not a bad thing for me, because I like amber! I also tried layering with Batucada and this works well, the amber gives some depth to the sweet citrus notes. I bet it works for light flowery scents too.  Ambre Extrême is very long lasting, I sprayed it on at 9am and next morning at 9am it was still clearly there on my skin. Sillage is also heavy on me. Not sure if I like it enough for a full bottle, but I'll definitely use the sample again!"", ""Sorry Hoxx but it lasts at least 10 hours on me. All L'Artisan frags are unisex and all ambers are as well. To me, it's the greatest single note created. I have about 15 amber frags and this is in the top 1/3. Is it simple, yes, is it better than TF Amber Absolute, no but for the price it can't be beat. I can go on days and days about this scent but I don't like long reviews. The point is, if you like straight up ambers, get this. If not go for something like Ambre Russe."", ""This is a scent I almost totally love, except for one part - there is no way and no reason to write Extreme on this bottle. Extremely good or extremely weak are not viable explanations. Aside from longevity problems that are easily one of L'Artisan stamps, this is a very lovable perfume. First of all, it's perfectly unisex - unless you think amber is women-only note. It is a plushy, velvety amber with a hint of vanilla and spice. It's warm, cuddling and comforting. It opens with a set of spice but quickly turns into an amber heaven, with the right dose of sweetness from subdued vanilla note. That's pretty much that - the scent is as linear as it gets(however, I never said that's a bad thing in my book, as it practically enables me to know what to expect all of the time). I haven't felt anything remotely similar to clay or Play-Doh, it's just a sweetish fluffy amber on me. Now, the scent's performance is a whole other story. Ambre Extreme lasts about three hours on my skin, with little to no sillage. It wouldn't bug me this much in normal conditions, but I expected something in the line with the name, so, make sure you know that you won't get anything extreme from this fragrance in terms of projection and/or longevity. It is, logically, more suitable for winter time and cold days, but can also be a romantic scent - believe me, you won't scare anybody with this one, man or woman.

I had scratched my Amber itch with Estee Lauder Amber Ylang Ylang, but I recently ran out. And with the temperatures in the midwest dipping below zero for the first time in years, I found myself hungry for comforting amber. I don't smell much going on in Ambre Extreme other than amber, but the amber itself is lovely. It goes on strong, but fades after an hour or so to a nice skin scent. Much longer lasting than most L'Artisan perfumes on me. I highly recommend this one for fans of amber, though I admit that Amber Ylang Yland is still my favorite!"", ""Strong Play-Doey amber, but I love that Play-Doh smell! This is it--pure and true. There might be a touch of vanilla after a couple hours, but it is not very sweet at all. Strong peppery notes too.

This was the comment of a workmate as she entered my office after I had sprayed the EDP, and sums it up to perfection. Yes, indeed it does smell like the 70's.

(zero actual amber - though I know there is vanillin in amber)...... and a headache! The quality is there for sure, it has proved very long lasting for a scent I have tried to wash off several times, and a full 8 hours later, my office still smells like a free folk festival in 73! I think this is a child of its time, and that time is not now, its very dated. Its not a terrible smell (ignoring the pee and sweat), but safe to say, its not for me.

The name - evoking amber - is according to my experience misleading: I cannot smell any 'amber' but just an 'idea' of it, translated into reality while using spicy caramel and adding also a touch of vanilla to the juice.

I have it for 6 months now. It is not that my rooms are filled with an unchanging cloud of amberscent fulltime, it's like different types of amberwaves pass through the room, small quiet waves, then comes a stronger wave, then the ambersea is almost still and so it goes on. Never a tsunami of amber. Wonderful to sniff at and hold it to my nose if I need a direct ambershot. Very, very pleasant if you're an amberlover. The container is beautifully handcrafted. The amberball is at its best in summer and fall, that is my experience until now. I gave one to my mother for her birthday, and she loves it.

The problem with presenting a base such as amber with few other notes as embellishments is that there is a very real risk of boredom. To me, AMBRE EXTREME seems a bit like amber on sedatives: polite and calm. The amber in this composition smells smooth, slightly sweet, and generally pleasant, but it leaves me wanting something more. I learned from reading a page from Ellena\'s forthcoming book (using the ""look inside"" app. at amazon) that vanillin generally features in labdanum amber (not animalic ambergris...) constructions, which would seem to imply that it does not add anything to this creation, in particular, beyond what already counts as a part of the amber itself. Having worn AMBRE EXTREME for a while this evening, long enough to grasp that it was indeed a minimalist creation without any of the distractions which tend to make oriental perfumes so interesting, I reached for my bottle of BAL A VERSAILLES, with which it was of course fully compatible, being essentially part of the base of that perfume. I am sure that this fragrance has its following, but as far as amber perfumes are concerned, I myself am more of a Serge Lutens AMBRE SULTAN or Histoires de Parfums AMBRE 114 type. If asked to select a J-C Ellena amber, I would definitely opt for AMBRE NARGUILE, which seems to me considerably more appealing than this one.', ""Jean-Claude Ellena está considerado como uno de los cinco perfumistas mejores del mundo y en mi opinión posiblemente sea así.

Segundo este ámbar lo ha potenciado trabajándolo con la vainilla, de ahí y con mucha coherencia el nombre de Ambre Extreme. Es un perfume en el cual el ámbar es el gran protagonista. Quizas sea exclusivamente una fragancia de otoño e invierno ya que es muy cálida ( Cosa completamente obvia por el ámbar ) y sobre todo porque es tremendamente intenso y se huele a varios metros de distancia. A mi personalmente llega a marearme y tuve que regalarla ( Cierto es que la prové en mí y en varias personas en verano, a más de 30ºC ) pero aún así dejo mi subjetividad para valorar esta fragancia y debo decir que es de las grandes.  Un ámbar de una gran pureza que se reúne con especias y nobles maderas que la ensalzan y le dan esa compleja profundidad y ese misterio que logran crear en el ambiente los grandes perfumes."", ""I am very fond of amber, but there is a great deal of variability in the quality. Some ambers smell like clay, or Play-Doh (as remarked on by another reviewer), or sweat, none of which do I find desirable in my perfumes. I'm currently testing about 8 different amber perfumes, in hopes of finding one that merits devotion. Ambre Extreme is one of them, along with Lutens Ambre Sultan, Ambre Precieux, & others...So far, I find that the Ambre Extreme seems solid. It's quite simple---I get amber, vanilla, and a hint of spice. The initial scent is not so prepossessing, having strong overtones of clay/Play-Doh; but those dissipate fairly quickly. I am left with a nice warm amber, with a bit of spiciness, and a creamy vanillic base. It doesn't project much but does last well, although in later stages I smell only amber, without the creamy rondure or spices. Compared to the Ambre Sultan, it lacks complexity, but it does last much longer on me. I over-sprayed other scents on the Ambre Extreme and discovered that it makes a wonderful layering perfume, adding depth and richness to florals or florientals; but at the price point of L'Artisan Parfumeur, I'm not sure I want to be layering in order to love the product. I think it could be a very satisfying scent for a man, however."", ""I love this perfume! It is one of my winter favorites. I have been looking for an amber fragrance for so long and this one is just perfect! The amber is soft, sweet and warm. The opening is quite spicy (I prefer the dry down) and a little dry. But once it settles down it becomes creamy, the vanilla makes it so cosy! The staying power is great. People around me often tell me I smell nice when I've been wearing it for several hours. I can also smell it on my pillow and in my hair when I wake up the next day!"", ""I've just smelt this in Space NK. I love Amber but am not keen on Patchouli. This smells really expensive and mysterious. Am tempted to buy now as the weather is foul for June but we could have a heatwave next week that lasts until October (I live in hope!) so will hold off on buying until Autumn. Mmmm!"", ""I ordered a second sample of this, because it seemed too bland to me the first time, but the reviews made me think I might be wrong. So, second try and still I don't get it. I mean it's nice, warm, sweet (but not too sweet), comforting. It's NOT spicy; not on my skin anyway. It's amber and vanilla pure and simple. It's also a cocooning, skin scent that I like but only I can smell. And it doesn't last too long; about 4 hours tops. I can't say I don't like it, but I don't feel like investing in a full bottle either. Wearing it side by side with MP&G Ambre Precieux, this comes out as the softer and more linear of the two. However, if you want a perfume that focuses on amber and amber alone, this might be the way to go."", 'Reworking --// Presentation: 5/10 Uniqueness: 2/10 Value: 4/10 Longevity: 4/10 Projection: 3/10 Smell: 7/10  Overall: 5/10', 'If you like this, go for Byblos Patchouly, they are almost identical.', ""I like ambery scents and this one is no exception! It is so well crafted, strong and daring, but not very long-lasting. I enjoy to smell it on some people (not for everyone!) but on my skin I prefer L'Eau d'Ambre (not Estreme)"", 'Aeternitas has said it perfectly! I too love this scent, I find it gorgeous and delicious in every way. It is a refined and sophisticated amber with just the right amount of vanilla sweetness and smoke.....for me, the Ultimate Amber! I want to bathe in this, to swim in it, to drizzle its molten amber fluid across my skin!', 'Rich, heavy amber without the unfortunate body odor note I sometimes get with ambers. Lovely, dark, almost vanillic amber that just smells like dark gold. One of my favorite ambers.', 'L´Artisan is my favourite perfume house and Ambre Extreme my favourite amber. I love the cleanness, I do that in frangrance anyway. This is a great mixture of clean and dirty :p.', ""L'Eau D'Ambre Extreme is all that I look for in a fragrance - spicy, warm, dark, sensual, noticeable and somewhat masculine. I think it could be more for a man than for a woman. It's a rich oriental amber blend and it plays out on my skin perfectly, starting with a peppery burst and ending in a smooth, oriental ambery sandalwood holding an undertone of vanilla. It reminds me of the actual color, look, and feel of true amber. It's smoky and comforting, best for winter and cool days, too much for summer. It's my favorite!"", ""There is a certain quality about L'Artisan fragrances that most houses can only aspire to. I have a few of their scents and they are simply a cut above. This L'eau D'Ambre is no different. A beautiful, enchanting aroma in the beginning, a blast that reminds me of a honeyed marshmallow. In the drydown, you get the warm spices (mostly nutmeg) and the creamy vanilla. It is slightly gourmandish but doesn't cross that line completely. I wore it on my hands before bed one night and before my head hit the pillow, I noticed the room smelled so sweet and clean. I woke up the next morning, eight hours later, smelled my hand and that marshmallow smell was there again. There is no major sillage with this thing but it lasts and lasts."", 'What a surprise! I was expecting a well behaved amber (like HdP 114, or Saab Ambre n.3). And no! On my skin, it opens very masculine, with a blast of bitter orange. Shortly after it goes on the ""dirty amber"" side, with animalic spices (cumin and carraway probably), as well as an earthy patchouli. The drydown is less unique, developing the typical sweet powdery resinous vanilla - typical of amber fragrances -, leaning unisex (maybe a bit feminine). Unique opening (A+), and classic drydown (B). This gets an A-. Final grade: Love, but misses the masterpiece honor list for some reason. Colder days, 20+', ""I do get a slight play-doh in the opening, which doesn't bother me, and then it dries down to a beautiful incense. Not too sweet at all. Everything doesn't need to be a bomb. Bombs sometimes come across as cheap body sprays so why aim for that all the time? This one is perfect, not too close and not too far reaching."", ""This is a scent I almost totally love, except for one part - there is no way and no reason to write Extreme on this bottle. Extremely good or extremely weak are not viable explanations. Aside from longevity problems that are easily one of L'Artisan stamps, this is a very lovable perfume. First of all, it's perfectly unisex - unless you think amber is women-only note. It is a plushy, velvety amber with a hint of vanilla and spice. It's warm, cuddling and comforting. It opens with a set of spice but quickly turns into an amber heaven, with the right dose of sweetness from subdued vanilla note. That's pretty much that - the scent is as linear as it gets(however, I never said that's a bad thing in my book, as it practically enables me to know what to expect all of the time). I haven't felt anything remotely similar to clay or Play-Doh, it's just a sweetish fluffy amber on me. Now, the scent's performance is a whole other story. Ambre Extreme lasts about three hours on my skin, with little to no sillage. It wouldn't bug me this much in normal conditions, but I expected something in the line with the name, so, make sure you know that you won't get anything extreme from this fragrance in terms of projection and/or longevity. It is, logically, more suitable for winter time and cold days, but can also be a romantic scent - believe me, you won't scare anybody with this one, man or woman. The scent, the smell is in line with some other amber masterpieces. The performance just isn't. 7,75/10"", 'I just purchase this from one of the discount sites because I’m having an obsession with amber at the moment! wow was I pleasantly surprised how much I like this. This is such a powdery amber and sits nicely on my skin. Projection is not strong but seems to waif up to my nose every time I move. The vanilla mix’s well with the amber and spices in the dry down. I am going to wearing this a lot this winter for sure. If you haven’t tried this get your hands on this especially if you love amber!', ""L'Eau D'Ambre Extreme is all that I look for in a fragrance - spicy, warm, dark, sensual, noticeable and somewhat masculine. I think it could be more for a man than for a woman. It's a rich oriental amber blend and it plays out on my skin perfectly, starting with a peppery burst and ending in a smooth, oriental ambery sandalwood holding an undertone of vanilla. It reminds me of the actual color, look, and feel of true amber. It's smoky and comforting, best for winter and cool days, too much for summer. It's my favorite!"", ""To begin with, I am not fond of amber notes. But I was so curious about Jean Claude Ellena's work, so I sampled this. If you like amber you will definitely love this. This is sophisticated amber, that is neither too sweet not sticky. Just cocooing amber that is perfect for someone close to you to smell..."", ""Woah, it smells like the 70's in here........ This was the comment of a workmate as she entered my office after I had sprayed the EDP, and sums it up to perfection. Yes, indeed it does smell like the 70's. Its heavy, spicey, aromatic and just a bit too over the top for me. I get vanilla, patchouli, and a very faint whaft of something like cats pee??? or (gulp) stale sweat??? (zero actual amber - though I know there is vanillin in amber)...... and a headache! The quality is there for sure, it has proved very long lasting for a scent I have tried to wash off several times, and a full 8 hours later, my office still smells like a free folk festival in 73! I think this is a child of its time, and that time is not now, its very dated. Its not a terrible smell (ignoring the pee and sweat), but safe to say, its not for me. I'm really surprised I found this so challenging, I love woody, spicey outspoken fragrances (Pom Noir from Jo Malone is my fave) and really don't go for very sheer, girlie smells.... ah well."", ""Not the best ambery scent. I can't say that I like it. I'm not a fan of sweetness, but I miss it here somehow."", ""Like everyone is saying here, it smells like Play-Doh. That's a hard pass for me. 4/10""]"
