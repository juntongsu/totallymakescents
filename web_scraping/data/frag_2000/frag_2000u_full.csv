I don’t really like the opening or mids since I find food spices like aniseed and cinnamon unappealing. Fortunately those notes diminish after the first hour and you’re left with a beautiful ambery, slightly smoky and musky aura that lasts until the next day.

Musc Ravageur just goes to remind me what a versatile note musk is and how it can have many faces, but retain that clean/sexy vibe, while blending with other notes. This is a spicy musk, but spices don't stand out. This makes it heady and light, sensual and cosy at the same time. It wears well. It's a lovely fragrance and it blends with the skin. Longevity makes it worth the price."", 'As someone who has been entering the barns since the age of 4, it definitely does not smell like a barn.

The neroli, cloves, tangerine and bergamot are coming out strong. It’s not unpleasant. It’s just unexpected. I had blind bought a sample and thought it would be the clean musk that changed my mind about musk; when I first started getting into fragrances, I had thought all musk scents were supposed to be animalic—and I was repelled by that—and this is that type of musk. It’s not entirely a dirty smell, but it’s getting there.  There is a softness about it that faint traces of vanilla, orris root and tonka bean provide, but the guaiac wood is still intense. It’s an interesting contrast. Not something I would wear outside or have as my signature scent. To me it leans masculine. I certainly wouldn’t mind it on a man. I might even love it for myself in the future and wear it in colder seasons, but I’m currently neutral and not in a hurry to get a full bottle, especially when I already have Shalimar EDP.', ""This iconic beauty doesn't need my review, but I simply had to declare my love. My life feels more complete knowing this gem. Complex, intriguing, inviting. I can't help but bury my face in my arm constantly when I wear it, wishing I was smelling it on man's skin instead. Unisex but leans male. It doesn't shout, it softly beckons. It evolves on the skin. Enjoy the ride. Mmmmmm."", 'The smell of love it or leave it. I ran away.', ""I'm re-posting a review of Musc Ravageur and deleting my 2021 review. Musc Ravageur is a nice vanilla-forward Spicy Oriental with a very slight, very wearable, animalic accord. Although the slight animalics set it apart from many mainline Spicy Orientals, its still not yhat complex. I'm not as amazed with it as so many others are. For a wearably animalic and complex scent I would favor something like MDCI Chypre Palatin, which is a complex Oriental Chypre of more classic scent profile. I even prefer CK Obsession for Men. But all in all, Musc Ravageur is pleasant but a little underwhelming. It's an easy wear though."", 'Oh my God — this isn’t just a perfume, it’s a poem. As I’m writing this review, I have Musc Ravageur on my arm, and I never imagined a fragrance could affect me this deeply.

The animality and skank has been turned up in this, a disturbing amount I must say, and the soft, delicate nuance of the 2012 version I remembered fondly is not found in this one. Maybe reformed, maybe reworked, who knows, but I didn't like this one I must say -- the vanilla and spice is still there, but the skank is just too much. Borderline urinic and barnyard. This new version is, unfortunately, a big NO from me -- I actually feels like it's lost its beauty and refinement, such a disappointment..."", 'Very close to Velvet Amber by Hugo Boss.

My wallet is crying."", 'Now, let’s talk about this iconic perfume. It’s dirty and skin-like but not in a bad way. It’s like wearing a beloved person’s jacket; there’s an intimate, comforting feel to it. It’s strong and sensual, the kind of scent that draws you in and makes you want to wear it again at intervals. It’s sweet-spicy, powdery, vanillic, and quite complex. If I were to list everything I detect in it, this review would probably get very long but the main notes I pick up are cinnamon, clove, vanilla, and a real skin scent. This combination could feel overwhelming in hot weather, so for me, it’s definitely a winter fragrance. It also carries a nostalgic vibe. Is it a masterpiece? Hmm… yes, it just might be.', 'First Impressions (Sample) I do not like this perfume at all. This is when I realized that warm spicy perfumes really aren’t for me. The cinnamon in this is way too aggressive, and the whole composition leans too dark and dirty on my skin. There’s a skanky edge to it that I couldn’t get past. If you hate this one too but still want something in the same ballpark, I’d suggest Initio Absolute Aphrodisiac instead. It has a similar sexy mood without the harsh cinnamon. Edit 1 This smells exactly like Old Spice Night Panther deodorant on me. Once I made that connection, I couldn’t un-smell it. Edit 2 After testing hundreds of perfumes since then, I’ve tried to give this one another shot. It still doesn’t work. The cinnamon mixed with animalic musk just doesn’t sit right on my skin. I can’t get into it. Summary Smells like: Old Spice Night Panther Deodorant Family of: Animalic musks (Carnicure by Marlou) Sillage: Medium-Strong Verdict: Pass – Frederic Malle is going to be reformulated, so even if I liked this, I wouldn’t risk making it my signature. It’s too unbalanced and now too unstable.', ""Everything Estée Lauder touches they water it down to 20% of the original strength. It’s the worst thing to happen to some of the best fragrances out there. Do the creators of these masterpieces care or they happy to ride off into the sunset with the money from the acquisition?

I mean it's a bit of an exaggeration to call it a designer but you get the point."", 'I can’t pinpoint which one of the notes is really doing it for me, but this is truly a panty dropper.

I don't think about that when I spray this. It's a creative masterpiece that doesn't smell like anything specific, you can say it smells like cinnamon or sex or whatever but meh... not to me.  To me this just smells like Musc Ravageur and it's a scent that makes me feel incredibly empowered. The first time I smelled it, it felt like one of those psychedelic trips or dreams where you go somewhere in your mind that somehow you know you've been before and you will be back. Like deja vu but stronger."", 'Although technically classified as unisex, this skews so heavily masculine a cop might pull it over for drunk driving. But let’s be clear, this isn’t the new age masculinity of self-proclaimed “alpha males” and chronic online complainers. This is traditional masculinity. Well-groomed, effortlessly charming, well-traveled, cultured, mature, and quietly confident. The kind of man who tucks in his shirt, wears jeans that fit, and still believes in opening doors. Honestly, I can’t picture this working on anyone under 30. It demands the kind of presence you simply don’t have when you’re still figuring yourself out in your younger years.  On the right person? *Chef’s kiss.* Refined, smoldering, magnetic. On the wrong person? You’ll smell like a little brother clomping around in his big brother’s dress shoes. Another review called this perfume a “relic,” and while everyone’s entitled to their opinion, respectfully: timeless perfumery doesn’t expire. Nor is it confined to trends. It exists, persists, and continues to hypnotonize regardless.  TLDR: A warm, quietly confident scent for grown men. Not loud, not flashy—just deeply masculine and self-assured. Wouldn’t recommend for anyone under 30.', 'This would be a sexy date night scent and you are going to be the dessert 3rd date type of scent for sure purrrr', 'with Musc Ravageur it was settled in no time. I bought this perfume around 2000. the part of the name I loved was \'Ravageur\'. lately I am scouring (if that is a word, I mean strolling along, investigating the Glob of 270+ perfumes) and each time I come above with an exhilarating new old perfume. this time it\'s this. upon first whiff instant recognition yet for what seems like an alien element. afterwards it appeared to have been one of the ingredients stuck in the nozzle. it was as if all the separate notes appeared one by one before my nasal aromareceptive passage. what I thought was mint or eucalyptus (and then each time, \'No, that ain\'t it\') finally I saw the lavender in the perfume\'s opening. this was incredible. later it was more absorbed in the general whiff of the perfume. and the overall impression of this perfume is that it is a fabulous and all circumferencing and interspersing perfume which easily would fill an Aula or Auditorium or a Space where other exemples of Art would be presented, these Museal and even Mausoleum Sanctums Spaces with this perfume as undeniable Intrusion, yet, a Sweet one but deeply, deeply sweet and what someone said before me, Cloying. interesting considerations came upon me. first of all Perfume is emotional for me. almost without whichever thought. yet, that was largely before 2000, 2010. now Fragrantica informs me on a High level and it only adds to the pleasure and deep satisfaction. I now know I smell Musc Ravageur without actually smelling the Musc. I am amnostic to \'White Musc\', \'Synthetic Muscs\'. so I smell this perfume around a Vacuoid. yet for me that doesn\'t matter. I am able to smell Muscs of the Animal Kind. an anecdote may clarify this. when we were kids, in the 1960s, my straight twinbrother and me went to the Zoo with our parents in Rotterdam. \'Blijdorp\', Happy Village. the Zoo was large and worldfamous. we weren\'t the kids that went straight running for the apes. they were like people and then we had not so much pleasant experiences with people. now I must speak for myself: what I wanted to see were Elephants, Giraffes, Lions & Tigers & Panters, Rhinos. then the Wild Big Cats (lions, panters and tigers) had outplaces and indoor heavily Barred, Cages. you had a long corridor (I would now say perhaps 200 meters) which bended to the right, so as that you could not see the end of the corridor. each time a new display of (in rows) medium-little or medium-large, cages with Very Big and Very Dangerous Lions and Tigers in them. I was the only one who wanted to walk alone in that corridor (where also other people roamed) but along these cages with these Big Dangerous Cats. the moment you got in a very heavy, heady, foul, stench befell upon you and took you hostage. it was Pisslike, not so much feacal, but infringingly hostile the first moments, the scent of their bodies and with Testosterone (the Males) and Oestrogens (the Mama\'s with cubs) that bodysnatched and devoured you whole. the kick was to walk the walk twice. I didn\'t know what kind of ritual this was To Me. but in hindsight there is a reason I like the heaviest, most opulent, most Flowery and with Ouds and Civet or Castoreum enriched perfumes. I am kind of.. \'at home\'. now THAT IS MUSK TO ME. then I read about ""white muscs\', \'synthetic muscs\', anosmia toward these, just now, again. I do smell, I think, a super satiated amber floriental perfume. this is entirely my league. I just find it so interesting to smell this Legendary Perfume maybe not as it is meant, and then, erroneously so. because Amber and Musc, Spices, Flowers and Woods all coordinate their effluxes toward one mass of inimpenetrable at once Furious as also controlled, Haute Parfumerie with even aromatic aspects (another multivalid denominator) and then the fruits all fly me by as in: not smelling them. I feel I smell this perfume somewhat different as other people, but isn\'t this the case with each perfume and everyone ? I love the perfume and that it is an \'oldie\'.', 'It’ been on my wishlist forever and I had a chance to test it on paper, skin and clothes. It was bold, rich, sultry and my worst fear: on the verge of cloying. It’s a bummer, I got the idea that maybe this one could work really well on men, but not on my chemistry so I took it of from the short shortlist. Skip ahead 4! days - Chilling on my livingroom floor and sniffing my jacket and the tester strip from the evening I sprayer Musc Ravageur on and I am a dead man walking. Till a tad bit more vanilla than I’d prefer but the zillion notes blended into this dangerous smell of an fine yet indecent man with a nighttime business sht to handle. Still won’t buy a full bottle as I cannot justify spraying it on my autumn clothes now, to smell like a maffiaman I shouldn’t date anyway in September. My almost 60y dear mother choose this and Megamare out of like 45 test strips and decants as top favourite having been the first shockfactor. :D', 'Love at first sniff sniff.This fragrance is pure seduction in a bottle. Warm, sensual, spicy-sweet, and animalic – it wraps me in a cloud of cinnamon, vanilla, amber, and musk that feels both intimate and magnetic. On my skin, it opens with a blast of spicy warmth, almost like a luxurious dessert, but quickly settles into a deep, soft, musky embrace. What I adore most is the balance: it’s bold but never overwhelming (well… unless you go for 20 sprays like I sometimes do!). It lingers for hours, sometimes even into the next day, leaving a trail that’s cozy, sexy, and a little bit wild. For lovers of rich, opulent, slightly “naughty” scents – this is a masterpiece. Musc Ravageur has stolen my heart, and honestly, I don’t want it back.', 'i hate it with all my heart', 'Not overrated in the slightest, extremely classy with the perfect amount of sweet and spice to entice you into a musky raunchy base, honestly a really cool execution, smells timeless and old-fashioned I’ve totally smelled this on a professor before this isn’t “old man” in the slightest', ""A scent I really didn't want to like!! Various reviews regarding the animalistic/cloying/old fashioned aroma. So, got a small discovery set with musc ravageur, Vetiver Extraordinaire and Uncut Gem. I'll ignore the other 2, but this had all the traits above so thought nope not for me......until 20 mins after when this sweet/warm/amazing fragrance became more than I expected, yes it's similar to le labo Laburnum but better. Had loads of compliments and I keep the name as my little secret i don't want anyone to know about. My only decision which size bottle to get as I think this alongside diptyque eau capitale and eau savage 2017 will never leave my fragrance shelf it's that good.....I now have 2 x 100ml bottles btw."", 'Dangerously sexy.', 'Today I\'m going to finally be reviewing something that\'s been on my list for a long time; Frederic Malle\'s Musc Ravageur. Musk isn\'t typically a note I search out in fragrances I wear. It\'s fine as a supportive note, but as a primary focus it typically loses me. However, it wasn\'t the musk in the name that drew me to this fragrance, it was peoples\' reviews. Over and over again I heard people describe this fragrance as the scent of lust, sex, primal desire. Someone said ""if the smell of sex was a perfume, this would be it"", and another said ""this is the scent you put on if you know it\'s gonna go down"". That alone was enough for me to decide this is something I want to experience for myself. Let\'s get into it and see if the reviews are true; Scent: The opening is sweet, spicy, and musky. The primary notes I get are vanilla, musk, cloves, and cinnamon. The strongest of the notes are the vanilla and musk. The vanilla is what initially hit my nose after the first spray. It\'s sweet, creamy, and gourmand just like a vanilla note should be. I wouldn\'t say it\'s particularly natural smelling, but not overly synthetic either. Somewhere in between, like a vanilla extract. The musk comes in right behind the vanilla with a powdery, fuzzy, but also somewhat animalic accord. It has that bitter bite that animalic notes can have, as well as the warm ""skin-like"" tone that musks will sometimes carry. True to the name of the fragrance, it\'s the type of musk that exudes sensuality and carnality. Up next is the cloves and cinnamon. Both notes bring the warm, spicy accords that they\'re known for, but they are distinguishable from each other due to the sweet and powdery undertones of the cinnamon, and the slightly sharp and camphorous undertones of the cloves. The dry down is sweet, warm, and musky. The primary notes I get are vanilla, cinnamon, musk, and sandalwood. The strongest of the notes are the vanilla and cinnamon. The vanilla is still a focus in the dry down with the same sweet and creamy accord from the opening, but a little more prominent now that\'s it\'s not fighting the heavy musk for the spotlight. Meanwhile, the cinnamon has risen to the top with it\'s warm and spicy tones to meld with the vanilla and create a beautifully gourmand accord. This is followed by the musk and sandalwood. The musk is still present in the dry down, just to a lesser degree than it was in the opening. It still has the warm, animalic, skin-like tone from the opening to keep that sensual vibe going. Lastly, the sandalwood offers just a bit of powdery woodiness in the background. Not enough to overtake any of the other notes, but it\'s there if you look for it. I also get just a touch of extra animalic undertones from the animal notes. Performance: Initial projection within the first hour is strong at around 6 feet. Sillage is very strong with a dense and heavy scent trail. After about 4 hours the projection was still around 6 feet and the scent trail was a tad bit lighter but still easily noticeable. At the 8 hour mark the projection was about 3 feet and the scent trail had died down a bit more but was still noticeable. The fragrance became a skin scent around the 10 hour mark. When to wear: Musc Ravageur is a fall/winter fragrance that\'s best suited for evening wear. If it wasn\'t already immensely obvious, this fragrance is something you wear for special occasions. Date nights, anniversaries, anything where you\'re going to want to get close to somebody. For those same reasons, don\'t wear this to the office. Blind buy: I wouldn\'t necessarily call this a safe blind buy. It\'s mostly vanilla, and that\'s about as safe a note as you can get. However, the animalic and sensual musk plays a big part here as well, and not everyone will vibe with that the same way. If that sounds good to you though, definitely give it a try. Final verdict: Having now experienced Musc Ravageur for myself, I can say that the descriptions I read were not far off. This fragrance unapologetically oozes sexuality during every stage of the wear, from opening to dry down. In fact, I think Frederic Malle should fight Tom Ford for the rights to the name Vanilla Sex, because it fits this fragrance so much better. It also doesn\'t lean to heavily feminine or masculine, and stays true unisex throughout. In terms of performance, Musc Ravageur isn\'t beast mode but is definitely still a powerhouse. Strong projection and scent trails for at least the first few hours, and staying around for about 10 before fading away. When it comes to versatility, this fragrance isn\'t winning any awards. The only place this will feel remotely appropriate is during special occasions on cool nights. Anything other than that, and this just won\'t fit. For mass-appeal, I would rate this one above average. It\'s mostly vanilla through and through, and almost everyone will love that. But there is the persistent animalic musk that permeates the fragrance, and that will throw some people off. To wrap this up, I think Musc Ravageur absolutely deserves the credit and accolades it has, but I do think it\'s overpriced a bit for what it is. I\'ll pass on buying a full bottle for now, and just stick with the other vanilla fragrances I already have. Maybe later down the line I\'ll get this one for those ""special occasions"". Scent: 8/10 Longevity: 8/10 Sillage: 9/10', 'I\'ve been putting this off for quite a long time. I\'ve heard that this is a musky, animalic beast of a fragrance, I\'ve heard it smells like pure sex, a homeless guy\'s sweaty balls, aphrodite\'s tits, cat piss, cinnamon buns, minotaur pheromones among many other things nd I expected it to be challenging, after all, the label on the bottle wouldn\'t say ""MUSC RAVAGEUR"" in big, bright red letters for nothing, right? Then I actually tried this. At first I was confused, then relieved, then disappointed, and finally I realized that I actually like this a lot. Musc Ravageur is ultimately a gourmand, it basically smells like Guerlain and cinnamon buns with A LOT of cinnamon. Extremely pleasant, it does have a bit of that ""dirty vanilla"" aspect you\'ll find in some Guerlains, but besides the strong projection, there are no monsters to be found here.  Needless to say, this isn\'t your run of the mill, synthetic vanilla & tonka blob like you\'ll get from PDM, Initio or Killian. Not to throw shade at anyone, I like some of those too, but this is in a completely different ballpark, this is a mature, textured, complex scent that\'s heavily based on the Shalimar/Habit Rouge amber DNA, but this is cleaner, smoother, more modern, this doesn\'t have the the juicy, articulating bergamot opening, instead this opens with a a massive blast of warm spices that takes me back to that time I tried eating an entire spoonful of cinnamon because of a youtube challenge.  Very realistic, very intense, but if you like cinnamon then you\'ll probably love this. My only complaint is that I wish the jaw dropping opening lasted a while longer, although the more vanilla forward drydown is magnificent in its own right.  In short, awesome stuff, classy but with lots of attitude, really fun to wear, Ignore comments that call it dated and try it for yourself, this is timeless and an easy cold weather reach.', 'Tried this as I got the wrong sample sent to me (I ordered carnal flower). Now, I am a woman and can totally see this working on a man. It\'s a very captivating scent with outstanding performance. To me, I smells like spicy, burning wood, with a layer of sweetness over it, and a heart of ""animalic"" coming through. But it doesn\'t work on me at all, I had to scrub it off with soap (and I can still smell it). I don\'t think this is unisex but definitely male. I think on the right guy this will be super sexy. I imagine that guy to be a dark, mysterious rockstar type of guy.', ""I love this scent. I am absolutely going to have to buy a bottle. It's so sensual. How are other people not getting Oajan here? To my nose, it's in the same territory, plus animalics. I can see why it's so polarizing, definitely not blind buy material, but it's perfect for my taste. 9.5/10"", ""When we first encountered this fragrance, we stared at each other for a long time, a tête-à-tête lasting several hours. He danced around me, touching me with his multiple olfactory movements, while I sought out all his colors and shades. What a beautiful choreography we created; he loved my skin, and I loved his dance. Beyond everything that has already been written, I would add that this fragrance is much more than just a spiced vanilla amber, MR is like a panther lurking in the shadows, ready to come and scratch you, hissing/purring... I love that animal note! It's one of my basics, my essentials."", 'a lot of people on here are FERAL, like on all fours, for this fragrance which i sort of understand? its filthy and hot as much as it is very elegant and refined. its dramatic and brazen, opening warm and spicy, then after a few hours, the wood and vanilla notes and eponymous musk emerge just as strongly. it is very warm and highly sensual. i get lots of tangerine, spicy cinnamon, amber, aldehyde, and musk, altogether producing an extremely rich cocktail... it’s very unique, unlike anything i’ve smelled before. i love it sm. MR smells to me like: its 10pm in the progressively chillier late autumn of new orleans. on a whim, you go alone to a very grand and upscale nightclub full of pretentious, self-proclaimed “old money” college students (in law, lit, or philosophy), and icky (but rich) sugar daddies in their 40s. a lean white guy a half-decade older than you allures you with a nerdy (in a \'sophisticated\' way) pick-up line, his cockiness which he sort of wears well, and his evident \'intellectuality\'. hes just one step ahead of those guys who are \'into philosophy\' and sort of just found out about nihilism and stoicism; his knowledge is obviously more sophisticated, but he nonetheless mansplains niche concepts you pretend to care about. so hes kind of laughable and annoying, but it’s almost a part of his charm- he’s witty, confident, and kinda attractive, so you humour him, ironically. he\'s more of a spectacle and less of somebody you\'re actually into. musc ravageur is you dancing with him without leaving too much room for jesus (which might also be necessary seeing as the club is packed full of people). musc ravageur is the warm inside of his 100% merino wool pea coat. musc ravageur is the ambery air resulting from the melting pot of everyone\'s autumn/winter perfumes and colognes in the nightclub air. either that scenario, or simply hugging a taller somebody inside of their toasty trench coat standing amidst frosted streets in chilly air. musc ravageur is for a very refined, introspective ‘thinker’ who doesn’t have it all figured out and is highkey lonely, so they (wo)manise for the plot and their ego, conquering more people. they exercise this mysterious, romantic and absolutely captivating allure for shits and gigs, frequenting at city nightclubs. their confidence comes from the notion that ""nothing matters,"" and whilst they find no magic in life, it\'s easier to romanticise a life full of seduction and intrigue. furthermore. they find comfort in their social reputation, that nobody can guess that they\'re completely jaded. all they can see is somebody with everything one could ever want in life; smarts, charisma, looks, money, and an exciting romantic and social life. they’re tragic, but valid. and hot. they also have a pretty good taste in fragrances. they are that one enigmatic one-night stand you can’t seem to stop thinking about. you yearn to know more about them, but they’re so out of your reach. so all you do is wonder, and catch glimpses of them in dark and intimate lounges, overpriced drinks, trench coats, and certain books, that faint whiff of rich amber and memory of dancing closely with them accompanying every time they cross your mind time and time again.', 'this is it, ive finally found my scent.', 'If you fw Vanilla Coke or black licorice you’ll like this', ""The opening is musty, animalic and a bit dirty daring. And that musky strange a bit obnoxious smells lasts rather long. But after about 4 hours there is a reward. A beautiful vanilla sweetness with some white chocolate aspects. Still musky but very sexy and alluring. It stays on the skin a long time. It melts in fact into you're own body odor. I get some Serge Lutens vibe here. Intriguing perfume."", ""Anyone smells anise??? I love this scent but I was flabbergasted that anise was not in the notes list. Maybe it's just me..."", 'If a young french professor was a perfume.. Despite his messy hair, round and old school glasses, questionable hygiene, even more questionable love life, and massive pile of belongings on his table, as well as his constant hurry and tendency to forget things, two things are flawless: his impeccable perfume taste and brilliant brain. He wears Musc Ravageur and has a wonderful aura.', 'Idk how to explain it, very nice vanilla earthy unique fragrance', 'That fragrance is something different and artistic. I hate it when I smelt it first, but after I smelt third time I fckng love it. This is masterpiece and not everyone’s taste. Realistic niche fragrance.', 'Due to unfortunate circumstances, my passion for perfumes lay dormant for nearly three years, until last summer when I resumed my quest for the perfect scent. Musc Ravageur stands as a watershed moment, dividing my life into eras before and after its arrival. My love for this perfume is profound. It does not suit me, feeling foreign and unnatural like a borrowed coat. However, on others, it is a delight. Should you seek to captivate me, wear this scent, and behold how my knees quiver beneath the light fabric, my cheeks flush, and my gaze grows shy. It is an extraordinary fragrance that exudes pure allure in every sense. Yes, some may find it provocative, but overall it is an extraordinary perfume. Intoxicating and enveloping, it leaves me in a state of elation bordering on ecstasy. Musc Ravageur is a masterpiece of perfumery, combining warmth and vitality with sweetness and gentleness, yet possessing a sharp and assertive edge. A timeless classic.', 'In the bottle, this fragrance smelled manly to me when I was looking for a unisex fragrance. On me, it somehow reminded me of Chanel No. 5 (which my mom wears), but not in a good way. Not for me.', 'Marketing aside, this isn’t that musky; no need to fear you’ll smell like B.O. What this really is, is an oriental: dark, sweet, spicy, and very nicely done, by famed perfumer Maurice Roucel. It smells very much like a dense rich gingerbread, heavy on cloves and cinnamon, and made slightly “ominous” or “dangerous” with a dark amber note that smells like labdanum to me. The vanilla-and-tonka is a *separate* sweet-deep-brown chord that comes out half an hour after the spices and amber; it’s softer, more rounded, as a clarinet is to an oboe. The natural point of comparison I have so far, as another dark, ambery, clove-dominant oriental, is Youth Dew, and I like Youth Dew better. It has more “lift” (after all, it has florals and aldehydes and incense as well as amber and spice) whereas Musc Ravageur is more squat and stays firmly in the “seductive dessert” zone. Youth Dew hits a “courageous heroine” emotional button for me that Musc Ravageur just doesn’t. MR is confident too, but in the manner of someone inviting a date to a fancy restaurant and promising to Blow Your Mind. It’s the Gingerbread Dom. That brash, macho smell is coming from an overly loud woody-amber. There are lots of better options for warm spiced Orientals (including masculine ones) that are less blaring and obnoxious than Musc Ravageur.', 'This is gorgeous, and I find that it leans towards some women’s offerings, particularly by Chanel I think I recall. You’ll know you have something very special with this one, and so will everyone else. It’s too reminiscent of what I’m used to women smelling like for me to want to wear it.  To my nose, there really is no comparison to Obsession for men, and that’s why I sampled it.  After some time with it I finally remembered that Creed’s Aberdeen Lavender shares some characteristics with this one.', 'I remember this one being stinkier in a good way, but that could be because I was relatively new to this hobby when I first tried this one. What I get now that my nose has developed is amber, lavender, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, vanilla. The amber makes me think of Chanel Coromandel, the lavender makes me think of Guerlain Mouchoir de Monsieur and Helmut Lang, the cinnamon nutmeg and vanilla are like something from Tom Ford, and the clove is the standout that separates this fragrance from most other fragrances. The lavender has some vintage animalistic stank to it like , but the clove has the faint reminiscence of the smell of a bowling ball or the inside of a rubber Halloween mask. Maybe that sounds off-putting or confusing, but somehow it all works together harmoniously. I don’t get any musk from it at all, but that isn’t a problem because I love the composition exactly as it is. Musc Ravageur is a 10/10 timeless niche masterpiece', 'Something fishy is going on with this one. The Frederic Malle website shows it out of stock in all sizes, and a nearby Estée Lauder outlet I visited had a ton of 50 ml and 100 ml bottles at 75% off sitting in the “discontinued” section of the store. Estée Lauder owns Frederic Malle. Best case scenario, it’s getting renamed or heavily reformulated. Worst case scenario, it’s getting discontinued altogether. I bought every single bottle. This one is one of my top 5 for life, and I own over 300 full bottles of fragrance', ""Some of the reviews for this fragrance are insane. This smells nothing like Grand Soir, Obsession, Tobacco Vanille, or anything by Roja (at least any that I've smelled). Neither is it dangerous, sexy, nor even particularly musky for that matter. This is a toothless, forgettable fragrance that smells primarily of pink bubblegum (unchewed in the wrapper) on a bed of Iso E super; add a sprinkling of clove, cinnamon, and powdered vanillin. 2/10."", 'This has an uncanny resemblance to the smell of these soluble headache relief tablets ""Solpadeine"". Maybe it\'s the influence from the tablet\'s color/packaging but Musc Ravageur gives me a fizzy, bitter, slightly-orange (in color, not the citrus) musty musk. It has subtle animalic powder texture in the opening which tapers off but overall it\'s a very linear and well-blended scent so it doesn\'t feel overwhelming at all. Also it reminds me quite a bit of Tauer\'s Au Coeur du Desert.', 'Dangerously sexy', 'A warm and tempting cinnamon and vanilla scent. I am not sure if I am able to detect musk in this. I think it is very unisex; anyone can wear it. But I can see why it may be more appealing on a man since there are so many feminine vanillas out there for women, and this is not screaming girly vanilla. Side note: according to the FM boutique staff in Seoul, G Dragon uses this fragrance', ""For a few minutes off the top, I get a bit of an indolic pong from this, reminiscent of a perfumed porta-potty on a hot day. Thankfully, it ebbs quickly, and Musc Ravageur becomes a dense, potent mix of creamy, sweet-and-salty amber; warm balsamic spice; tangerine-like fruitiness; and supple floral undertones.  It's an extremely sensual fragrance, luxurious and languid. Like a passionate tryst in a lavish, classically decorated bedchamber: antique wood, silk brocade, and bare skin, lit only by the crackling glow of a well-stoked hearth. It's distinctive and generous. Reminiscent of superb classics such as Shalimar and vintage Obsession, but also very much its own complex entity."", 'Sex in a bottle.', 'straight up masterpiece', ""Very good. I usually don't like lavender, but it's so smooth and so well blended in here. Warm, cozy and, yeah, like everyone states — sexy and truly unisex."", 'So we all know there is no such thing as a true panty dropper. However, earlier today I was in an intimate situation and this fragrance was effective enough to elicit a passionate response during an embrace.  I’m not going to say it set the mood but I will definitely say it fit the mood. I won’t get into what it smells like and which batch I have (I don’t know anyway). The point is, a half spray behind each ear, and this fragrance lived up to its name. And I’m sure a memory association was created. Update: Another intimate encouter with a different individual and received a couple of very similar responses as before. There is something about this fragrance that just works.', ""Honestly the best in its league of this type of perfume. Reminds me a Roja style perfume I remember trying this years ago and it was an immediate hard pass.. smelled way too musky and dirty and unappealing...just dirty sweaty musk with vanilla.. Now, I can't stop smelling my arm if I spray it. Intoxicating. Maurice is a genius perfumer.  Ironically I had the same experience with uncut gem (another by Maurice) first sniff, was average.... Didn't care for it.. now I can't stop smelling my arm when I spray that too. The power of Maurice perfumes is you need to allow your nose to be open to them. Don't jump too quick to write them off, you'll be surprised how much you miss otherwise. Simply masterpieces."", 'Musc and lavender, old money style, quite herbal, unisex. Interesting..', 'Comparing a pre-2014 reformulation bottle with a 2020 bottle; Here are my thoughts:  The older bottle has a strong floral component—a mix of indolic rose, earthy patchouli, and powdery iris—which blend into a fecal musk note. The 2ml sample I first fell in love with had a more urinous quality. The urinous musk was able to compete with the warm, sweet vanilla and spicy clove, amplifying the whole composition, while still retaining its integrity as a separate facet. The fecal musk, while successfully grounding and smoothing out the fragrance, causes the whole composition to feel too heavy and dark; Perhaps this effect is created because it blends too well into the rose and orris. I strongly prefer the more urinous musk note; So, beware that the musks used may have or take on different properties depending on the production batch.  In the 2020 bottle, the lack of a defining musk leaves the perfume smelling a bit thinner. Iso E Super is occupying its place, presenting as dry, woody ""pencil shavings"" as one might expect. This sharp dryness is a departure from the damp and dirty former iterations; Any seams are effectively masked by the clove. The newer formulation is also a bit sweeter, a neutral, sugary type of sweetness which is supported well by Iso E Super. Although the Iso E Super does a good job anchoring the fragrance while still allowing a urinous musk to speak, this musk is no longer the equal voice holding Musc Ravageur in balance. Overall, this composition feels less unapologetic, more unisex and generic—as if it were hiding behind a superficial, toothless smile. Both bottles have good performance and projection, the older bottle is noticeably fuller, thicker, heavier, and contains more naturals; But it\'s hard for me to definitively say I prefer it. This particular bottle feels old, appealing to a more classic perfume structure. It fails to capture the dashing, suggestively playful spirit that stole my heart. From a distance, the sillage of the two bottles would be hard to tell apart, but at arm\'s length or closer—especially side by side—the musk is noticeably present in the older bottle and noticeably absent in the newer one.', ""Okay, I get the appeal—I really do—but the con that said it has a Victorian-era gentleman's club vibe was so right (even though it gives me more of a 70s vibe). And, of course, it seems wayyy more masculine than unisex to me. So if ur a girl I wouldn't wear too much of it."", ""This smells like Oatmeal, Tobacco, and kitchen spices? Idk but the name is way too cool for such an underwhelming fragrance. To be honest you should just be real with yourself this is Tobacco Vanille... It's Tobacco Vanille by Tom Ford but cheaper, waste of a good name."", 'My personal take on this very gorgeous fragrance: Coca-Cola transitioning to Dr. Pepper and finally to a warm, musky sweet cinnamon roll - all in the most beautiful way!', ""Poetry in perfumery, No no,sorry! I won't be able to do this, to write about the beauty that should be felt in the deepest part of the heart,where the love take its breathe, One night the notes came to the magician when the night was dark,taking away the sleep from his slumber eyes,only after doing this he could sleep,and he slept,waking up our desires,leaving the rest of the world to praise him for what he did to get his sleep back. The tangerine note in the top,the sandalwood note appearing like a heart beat in the base,the spice drenched drunk musk,this creation is a challanging masterpiece for the perfumers to come, the beauty and the depth is hard to tell, it opens up its pages on you the more you experience it. I would have gatekept it but it was already popular when it reached to me 😊."", 'Bought a sample back in november. Didnt liked it at first but slowly grew on me.  Honestly at first it smelled like some light vanilla scent with clove and cinnamon added. It still smells like that coming back to but it smells, dusty? Weirdly reminds me of smarties. Powdery, spritzy, yet dry vanilla scent.  I like the scent but i honestly need to test it even more but i cant see myself buying one, its a very light scent so it disappears after four hours. Probably would best shine in summer nights', 'All killer no filler.  Sex? Play-doh? Shalimar? Carpe diem ok, you look hot in it.', ""Smells almost identical to MFK Grand soir. If you have one, you definitely don't need both"", 'Someone once described this in a way that was something along the lines of “using a cinnamon bun as a fleshlight”- its funny because half the reviews here mention the sex musk association and the other half dont seem to pick it up at all. early on in my fragrance journey when i first smelled this, i did truly get that upon first whiff. Maybe reading the reviews put that context in my head but i was hit over the head with the smell of that sex musk the early times i smelled it- and as one of the earlier niche experiences i had i was delighted by its artistry, and the fact that it also still felt pretty wearable. as some have reported, it turned a little unpleasantly indolic/pissy on my skin- hey, some people like that, but i dont. On clothes i also think this takes that same turn as well though, but not quite as bad- i think i mostly get a beautiful layer of soft sweet aromatic cinnamon paired with an indolic rose… there can be a bit of a projection of cozy warmth but up close you get a totally more human animalic experience- and i still find that very impressive. But smelling this now i dont get the same thing i did at all back then. In fact, someone pointed out that theres a dominant urinal cake accord and now its a classic case of “i cant unsee it”. A lot of vintage frags really give me this urinal cake accord (looking at you miss dior originale) and i hate it… i am often a lover of vintage perfumery but imo its an accord that would be better off to stay in the past… and i think it just settled with me that indolic fragrances really hit my psyche in an unpleasant way, and now its more pronounced to me when i smell musc ravageur, theres only one ive ever enjoyed by pineward perfumes. I hate that ive had such a fluctuation with this over time, it rarely ever happens to me, i still think this is an excellently crafted and unique release, but also i really wish i could see what i initially saw in this again and wish it was less of an indolic experience-but alas… Someone below really insistently compared this to shalimar, and at first i was kinda like “this is nothing like shalimar”, but actually… the drydown is very similar now that i think about it. Still, this is much better to me than shalimar, but i also hate shalimar so do with that what you will. Oh and scentville on etsy truly has a really close rep of this for like 35 bucks- They are a bit hit or miss but this i would recommend', 'This is what I think about when I think of fragrance as being ""art""  When I smell this I think of beautiful paintings, architecture and sculptures. Dry down is the real show stopper. Very different from the opening which is also great. If you wanna smell like no one else but in a great way, get it. 9/10', ""The hypocrisy of some people knows no bounds! This can be considered a „unisex” perfume, but Shalimar is not!  Musc Ravageur is practically 80% Shalimar with a modern twist and some different facets.  Even Maurice Roucel himself confessed in an interview that it is a modern and reinterpreted ode to Shalimar. Anyway, this is indeed legenday and one of the best amber oriental in the game, Just like Shalimar is!  I also find strong similarities between another important work of Roucel, namely: Le Labo Labdanum 18, which is basically a much more simplified Musc Ravageur and with a more pronounced emphasis on animalic labdanum! Fabulous all 3! You can't really call yourself a true connoisseur, a lover of perfumes if you don't have at least one Shalimar, Musc Ravageur, Labdanum 18 in your collection, whether you are a woman or a man! Period!"", 'Sexy and perfect for winter. It smells warm and dark. It’s unisex but leans very masculine', ""I've tried multiple times but decided this is just too funky and masculine for me.

Deep dark and warm. This to me reminds me much of the cabin lodge I stayed in during my stay in Lapland..it smells like the wood of the lodge that gave off this sweet woody scent mixed with something resinous. It’s a scent that grows on you.', ""It smells very slightly similar to Gucci Envy/FOMO The Envy of FOMO, maybe 30%-40% there. I am surprised these are not in the similar fragrance list. Musc Ravageur is like a version with more depth/smoothness. It is probably cause it has more musk and vanilla with less citrus and a weaker but slightly creamer sandalwood. Does come off a bit weaker to me though, but people say it is strong so maybe just going nose blind. Edit: Musc Ravageur changes a decent bit in the dry down while the other two don't change much. The performance is much better after another wearing. Edit 2: Okay I love this fragrance. I can't explain it but definitely give it a go. Have to be in the right mood and weather for it but if conditions are met it is just amazing. My gf hates the muskiness though unfortunately. Will have to try Meharées by L'Erbolario since it kind of like MR without the musk."", ""I wouldn't love smelling this on a man either, but this is really not suited to women at all. not unisex. as far as the scent goes, I think it's a bit strange and not in the best way. something really unsettling about it"", 'Vanilla-cinnamon aromatic unisex perfume.

If you like fragrances like Seminalis, Sadonaso, CDG Original, or even Japiur Pour Homme, this is for you."", ""Masterpiece for me. This could be long... Over the last few months, I've gone from designer into the niche world at a rapid pace. Even though it's not technically niche, one of the first 'more premium' fragrances I tried was Tobacco Vanille. I was wowed by it. Carried on testing niche and got very fussy very quickly. Niche fragrances went from wowing me to mostly not being enough for me (apart from a few). I wore Tobacco Vanille on a night out and it bored me. At some point soon after I got a sample of Musc Ravageur and all I could think of was Tobacco Vanille. I liked it, but forgot about it. As I carried on testing niche offerings, I quickly learnt that Frederic Malle fragrances are a level above most other niche brands in terms of quality and depth (at least for me). They won't always wow you on first sniff (Promise being the exception), but they'll keep you coming back. Unlike many other offerings from other brands which wow you, and then quickly either bore you, or you discover some aspect to it that you don't like. Anyway, as I'd decided that FM was quite probably my favourite niche brand, I revisited Musc Ravageur. Wow, after all this additional testing, I appreciate it so much more. Sexy, alluring, expertly blended. I don't love every FM fragrance, some I dislike, but the ones I do love are among my favourites. I went testing all these other fragrances looking for a winter date night fragrance and I had the perfect one all along in MR. The other ones I bought samples of don't hold a candle to it. And while it does remind me of Tobacco Vanille, it blows it out of the water. Often when I like a fragrance I find I'm trying to convince myself that I love it. With this, no convincing is needed, I'm just effortlessly sure of it. TLDR: Expertly blended high quality masterpiece. Will definitely be a part of my small collection."", 'This is amazing, wonderful, spicy,sweet but not gourmand sweet! This smell is captivating and addictive. I can’t stop sniffing my wrist.

It starts out with some sparkly juicy tangerine and vanilla that quickly (and I mean quick) turns into this warm, spicy cinnamon and vanilla fragrance. The cloves are present but thankfully these aren’t the cloves that feel medicinal or anything like that. The cinnamon and cloves come together to add bite to the fragrance.  The vanilla is beautiful. It’s not gourmand to where it’s headache inducing, it’s actually a very sexy vanilla and this fragrance to me feels more masculine. GREAT longevity. 8+ hours easy. Overall an incredible niche frag.', 'Such a strong, long lasting perfume... I easily pulled of 12+hours directly on skin and I\'m a fairly dry skin type of guy. Sillage is monster, people will hastily notice your presence and they do ask about the fragnance. Notes are bit on the masculine side despite the ""unisex"" label. Though it would be tiring and strong for the summer, 1 or 2 spray will also do the job in cool summer evenings; but this a direct winter perfume. I would expect more classy, elegant and detailed bottle but for the most people it\'s not important at all.  Its priceyyy, that\'s right but if you are looking for a serious sillage and longevity monster; try and go for it. Its out of from this world.', 'This is a weird one. It smells…addicting? Intoxicating might be a better word. I get noticed when I wear it but not complimented. That can’t be a good thing. I really don’t have the words to describe this scent, it’s so unique. But it’s not sexy if that’s what you’re after. But it’s extremely Alpha. An absolute boss of a fragrance. Powerful. Commands respect. It kind of gives me anxiety honestly but I keep coming back for more. Do I enjoy it? I really can’t tell. I find it overwhelming. It’s not that it’s such a massively strong projector. It’s the scent itself that’s so darn intense. I’m glad I own it, it’ll be perfect for something (I don’t know what yet). Do I recommend it? Sure, in the same way I’d recommend buying an exotic wild animal.

I digress... Musc Ravageur (which I saw someone translate here as Devastating Musk; a relief since Google translate keeps calling it “pest musk”) is so delicious to me: creamy vanilla, lavender, the kind of patchouli that smells like freshly turned soil and/or wet potato skins, musty wood and antique books. I have yet to meet a fragrance heralded as dirty or animalic that strongly gives that impression; I find this tame — very nuzzly, spicy, and sweet with an anise/licorice effect feathered out around the edges. Perhaps it smells a bit like my cat’s fur, ever sweet and dusty, but a pampered housecat is no animal to base your animalic impressions on. This walks that paradoxical line between timeless and retro, always in fashion like a perfectly worn-in bomber jacket.  I notice the similarities to Shalimar, but this does not take up as much space in a big, pushy, powdery way (btw I love Shalimar). Musc Ravageur is a warm wash of creamy, vanillic woods and spices, more muted, more linear, more self-effacing than Shalimar’s big, self-promoting, unmistakable cloud.', 'On initial spray you get an instant dose of an animalic sweetness. I’d say it’s mass appealing but it definitely has that strange animalic fur like note that seperates it from the rest. It’s like smelling a pelt rug while someone’s baking a pastry in the oven. The performance is eternal, it’s the next day and the dry down smells 1:1 to that big tub of nesquik. Powdery sweet and cinnamon. Overall a strange niche animalic vanilla scent 7.5/10.', 'Got the discovery set as a gift, now testing it one by one... So...Tested on my skin. I could not rub this off my skin.. It smells like my granpa. He would always use a bore bristle brush to style his hair using a pomade in one of the old tins. He also uses an aftershave in an emerald glass bottle.

I liked it a lot, but something in it gives me headaches so I won’t be adding it to my wardrobe.', 'First time wearing this today, biggest and best compliment I’ve ever gotten.  “OMG you smell so f’ing good!” And I’m over 12 hours in (behind the ears) and I’m still smelling it.  Leaving it at that.', ""I don't know where to start. A bit pissy in the beginning. Old school, traditional, maybe? Pretty fresh initial burst, which was surprising. But if you give it time, it becomes something entirely different. It mellows down into an amazing vanilla scent, warm, not sweet or gourmand.  Spices stay prominent, I'm mostly getting cloves and star anise. Maybe some fennel also? Can be smelled on clothes for a couple of days. It is a BIG YES from me."", ""Definitely musc, but not ravenous. When first spraying this on skin I'm hit with a wall of powder, and something balsamic (maybe a fougere feel with the lavender.) It's off-puttingly almost maternal to me, but it's essential to let the scent settle into skin. It dries into this divine, much subtler amber musk with a touch of this exotic spice/patchouli mix that reminds me of a waft of incense still in the air. Sensual and alluring, and I'm sure it will layer amazingly with many other things. However, it's also surprisingly tame considering the name (and other reviews I've read). After an hour this is a mellow, warm and easy to wear scent."", 'This stuff is amazing the bottle and name threw me off a little bit but I was pleasantly surprised it’s a cinnamon warm spicy bomb then drys down to a soft animation which isn’t over powering just a more complex less mass appealing angle share.I applied this at a store at 3:00pm and now it 12:30am I think I washed my hands twice and forgot about it and it just keeps going 9.5/10', 'This is a like for me, not a love. I do see somewhat of a similarity to L Lolita, but more so to Shalimar. I don’t really think it resembles Taboo. Maybe a little in that they’re loud and spicy. Anyways, I love those. I think Musc needs some more sweetness for me to love it. Now I know what people are talking about when they describe a perfume as dry. I’m glad it’s not wowing me because I don’t need to spend a lot for a perfume that I already own that is cheaper, similar and better. I will say the clove is well done. That note turns me off at times. I’ll probably layer this sample with something else and when it’s gone, it’s gone. I am thinking that Musc is better suited for a man. I’d probably dig it on a guy! Edit: Ok I get the hype. The dry down is a little sweeter and really nice and I am really seeing my beloved L.

For some reason I’m getting reminded of nishane ani x. I get a super dry woody base with vanilla and spice notes. It’s sweeter than I would have thought too. I think I like it…??', 'Lowkey smells like fruit loops. Lovely vanilla dry down. A win for those looking for something vanilla that is not gourmand or femme.', 'It’s original, it’s sexy and alluring. You def have to have a level of confidence but once you’ve reached that level then you’re unstoppable. It’s warm and inviting that stays close but shows you’re the boss. 🔥', 'Dated a guy who wore this and he drove me insane. Whenever he was near me, all I could think about was how he smelled. Looking back, I realise I may have liked his perfume more than I ever liked him. The opening citrus notes could be controversial to some - it took me a minute to appreciate them. However they dissipate quite quickly as the scent dries down into a warm, musky vanilla. Sexy, comforting yet inebriating - I still stop in the street when I think I smell something like it. Would absolutely be my scent of choice was it not so expensive.', 'The ultimate low key seduction scent. Cocooning vanilla, soft lavender, cinnamon and musk, I can imagine Nico from the Velvet Underground wearing this. It’s entirely unisex, gothic and gorgeous.  A masterpiece of contradictions: persistent yet subtle, alluring yet unassuming, mysterious yet delicious. I wear this when I want to feel silk on my skin but the cold winter weather demands I wear wool. Animalic in the most wearable way. It’s like a second skin for me, one that I adore. 🐈', 'I have to admit, it is super unique, but combination of cloves, ambery vanilla and animalic base makes me naseous a bit. Very worthy a sample.', 'Gotta love the people that call this dated but run around smelling like bubblegum which came out in the 1950s', 'This is one of those scents where it is very clear it is made by someone who is really into perfumery. So many notes and so many ways to interpret it. I really enjoy the cinnamon here, as it feels incredibly cozy. But there’s also something about this that is very grandma to me. This fragrance feels almost antique in its aura. This is sexy and unexpected at the same time. Weird…..I like it.', 'Ordered a sample and thank god I did!  Old rich boozy lady with an incense dry down in a hot car. Pass!', 'The night feels heavy with anticipation, the air thick and warm, wrapping you in a sensual embrace. The soft hum of laughter and clinking glasses fades into the background as you move through the dimly lit room, where bodies sway and whisper in the shadows. You’re dressed in a tailored Gucci velvet blazer, its softness mirroring the warmth that is starting to rise within you. Your Saint Laurent trousers fit like a second skin, the faintest brush of your Berluti boots against the floor echoing in the pulse of the night. You can feel the heat of the crowd around you, the air charged with the promise of something both forbidden and irresistible. The fragrance that clings to your skin is Musc Ravageur by Frédéric Malle—a scent that wraps you in the illusion of warmth and comfort, yet underneath, it simmers with a dangerous edge. At first, it feels like a soft, cozy embrace: warm cinnamon, comforting clove, and a soft vanilla sweetness, like the scent of a lover’s skin against soft sheets. It draws you in, wrapping you in a comforting cocoon, inviting you to linger, to settle into this moment of intimacy. But then, as the night deepens, it shifts, becomes something darker, more carnal. The warmth deepens into a throbbing, animalistic musk, almost feral, like the scent of bodies pressed together in secret. The vanilla becomes less sweet, mingling with the heat of sandalwood and patchouli—rich, decadent, almost dirty, pulling you into a place where the lines between right and wrong blur. The scent becomes a reflection of a forbidden, unplanned encounter—one where you find yourself pressed against someone you didn’t intend to kiss, your lips meeting in a clash of passion, your bodies reacting before your mind can catch up. Musc Ravageur doesn’t ask for permission; it takes control, urging you into the heat of the moment. It’s the fragrance of a forbidden kiss, of a relationship you never meant to start but can’t stop once you’ve begun. It’s cozy, yet dangerous—comforting, yet sexually charged, an intoxicating paradox that leaves you burning for more. As the scent lingers on your skin, it reminds you of the intoxicating thrill of surrender, of giving in to temptation and desire without hesitation.', 'On All Fours. Against the verticalization of the body, MR returns you to crawling—a regression and a fantasy of pure necessity. Bipedalism ends a world mediated by smell, where the nose and instinct sustain and reproduce the species. MR’s animality isn’t the promise of a good fuck but the nostalgia of returning to the organic—a world without words, where we can come together by sniffing each other for genetic information, licking and mounting one another. No great triumphs, only the thrilling certainty of something lost forever. A desire against desire. MR puts you on all fours—not to fuck you but to say: woof woof.', 'Very weird but interesting. I can’t imagine the situation I will wear this perfume in. Fills like you put your nose strait to well-groomed domestic and lovely male cat. Also I feel Siberian crafted solid and cloudy honey.', 'I want more musk, Amber, and sandalwood but the florals and citrus just don’t allow what I like to come through. Not many scents give me a headache but this one sure did. Glad it was only a sample. I don’t ever need to smell this again.', ""it dries down very nicely, but i'm not a giant fan of the top notes, kinda smells like carmex to me? the dry down makes it very worth it tho."", 'Gözlerinizi kapatın ve ahıra girdiğinizi hayal edin. İşte öyle bir koku', ""Disappointed with how little musk I get from this as time goes on. It's definitely dramatic, a seductive woman that teases in jazz lounges. Maybe gourmand musks just aren't my thing but to me it just smells like a warm average feminine luxury parfum."", 'this is so devious… dirty, warm and sweet. if i had a penis i’d shove it inside the bottle that’s how sexy it is.', ""It's fine? I was expecting something much more animalic. On my skin this is a lightly spicy vanilla. The drydown smells extremely similar to Diptyque Eau Duelle EDT on me."", 'Blissful. i’ve been looking for something like this my entire life…. sensual, dramatic, warm, enveloping, yet grounded, and a bit scary and carnal. urges you to give into your suppressed lust and psychoses, that which hides beneath the surface of your psyche. Sexy, sexy, resinous, cinnamony, so complex and resonant. it gives me EVERYTHING that i am and that i want to be! i will wear it every day of my life ❤️ (My personal strange comparison, but it is the perfume version of the album “The Great Annihilator” by Swans)', ""This fragrance embodies one's individuality. Roguish and sexy ;)"", 'The Song of Songs, as a perfume.', 'Animalic date night fragrance. Beautiful, relevant, you must embrace your inner beast to wear this haha', 'I couldn\'t make this one work, despite a real effort. I\'m not averse to pissy or animalistic fragrances either. Highly-praised, and the notes always seemed so interesting. I waited for the weather to cool and tried. Detested the opening, and then waited for drydown for the ""magic"" that never arrived. Smells like an airport bathroom: sterile lavender cleaning solution, piss on the floor, several peoples\' fragrances mingling, while a while overpriced and wholly unnatural honey-covered cinnamon rolls made with no ingredient a human should ingest are peddled nearby. Overall, Frederic Mall line has been a miss for my skin/preferences.', 'When i first tried this i found it headache inducing, heavy. Maybe because it was in August lol This requires cold to show its true beauty. The opening is beautiful. Cloves, citruses and lavender that settle down. As the storm goes away it slowly reveals its true soft nature of vanilla and tonka bean and cinnamon but not in a gourmand way. A timeless classic. Its not the loudest one for me but it’s noticeable and lasts a long time.', 'This is my favorite fragrance ever with wulong cha x.Im in love', 'First spray of my 2ml decant yesterday. Took me back to a beer festival I attended years ago with a good friend who knew a lot about hops and stuff. We waited in a very long line for a sample of some really high-end suds from some vaunted micro-brewery owned by blind monks or something. I knocked back the sample and the resinous tree-sap fluid obliterated my taste buds and collapsed my sinus cavity. ""Real good"" I told my friend who was in a state of bliss. I knew then I would never buy a bottle of that beer. I know now I will never buy a bottle of Musc Ravageur.', ""MFK Grand soir twist .. nothing much to extra pay for .. may be boring but still cozy scent .. don't repeat if you own Grand Soir or Even Ambre Nuit"", 'You mustn\'t fear the piss. You mustn\'t fear the piss. By no means do I suggest that those reviewers who have panned Musc Ravageur as ""pissy cinnamon buns,"" ""pencil shaving urinal cake,"" ""groin,"" etc. etc. are liars; the animal burrowed at the base of MR is an incontrovertible fact, despite the apparent reformulation. But their piss is not my piss - and your piss may very well be one and the same with mine. Allow me to explain: All my life, animals have hated me with an intensity that shocks witnesses and inspires genuine incredulity in those with whom I share my tales (see my review of Serge Lutens ""Fleurs d\'Oranger"" for notes on bear attack). Being a small, otherwise entirely inoffensive woman with a great deal of respect and fondness for nature, I have been forced to conclude that there must be something horribly wrong with my pheromones, ergo (in perfume speak) with my body chemistry. Twice in Chicago I was chased by packs of dogs. When I ""hot girl walk"" around my neighborhood in the twilight hours, animals go fucking nuts in the lit windows of houses. Bear encounters: multiple, lifelong, statistically significant in frequency. I have never been told that I smell bad, but the animals have independently concluded that my emanations are bad news, not copacetic, not biblical. So I\'m not entirely surprised, given the animal fear inspired by MR in some, that this fragrance smells on my skin like a kind of innocence. One more anecdote to illustrate what I mean by innocence. In one of my very first memories, I was four years old, sneezing away a little cold in the backseat of my parents\' Volvo. When we returned to the flat, I was either carried or toddled into the bathroom, where my mother ran me a Mr. Bubble brand bubble bath, disappeared, brought in a plastic medicine cup filled with Dimetapp, disappeared again, and then left me to my own ministrations. I remember getting into the hot bath, leaning my cheek against the edge, and then staring at the viscous, deep purple tincture in the cup on the edge of the tub. Motivated at that point in my life almost entirely by the thrill of narrative possibility, a smile rolled across my wan little face as I realised that I was not just a four-year-old with emotionally neglectful parents, but in fact was also an evil, dictatorial queen who had been served the finest of wines by her timid, self-effacing servants. How did I come up with this? The essence of the fantasy was even much more tinged with realpolitik than Snow White\'s evil queen, but its naissance aside, as I sipped my thick grape cure from its little goblet, I had a powerful premonition of illicit joy. Now however, when I smell Musc Ravageur on my elbow crook at 24 years old, it is not these actually borne-out illicit joys that I smell: it is the memory of the premonition, beamed back towards me in faded but no-less deeply arresting colors.  There is an animal in Musc Ravageur, but not the animal that lives in the dirt or infests the house: this is me as a young animal, me as rejected by animals. You mustn\'t fear the piss.', ""Fur coat, smokey eyeliner, artfully disheveled hair. Musc Ravageur is sexy, cozy, and warm. It's a fragrance I didn't love at first, but wanted to keep smelling. It becomes sweeter on my skin as it dries, but never too sweet. It's grown up."", ""I just bought a tiny sample of this perfume and wow! Very musky, very cozy as other reviewers have said and very fall winter. I do not really find myself drawn to musks and don't wear them, but if this perfume was more affordable I would consider buying it. Highly unique perfume, scent profile and story. I can see why a lot of people love this perfume, but it just isn't for me both scent and price. Would highly recommend if you like musks, cozy warm notes and something niche and beyond the basic fragrance on the market today."", 'I got Musc Ravageur (50ml) 3 days ago. I also used and still do use POAL by Frederic Malle, absolutaly amazing perfumery line. MR is super addictive and cosy scent. I got kinda mix of Grand Soir by MFK and Angels Share by Killian vibes but more unique and sexy version definitely. This perfume could be any gourmand lovers top perfume, sweet but not too sweet. It is not a gourmand perfume but when it goes deeper notes it becomes edible. I hugged a friend 2 days ago and this morning she told me she can still smell me. Amazing on both woman and men. I think i would enjoy this one on anybody but me because I realised I prefer overly obvious rose scents on me(I know it is super popular but Delina Exclusif is my absolut gem also i mix it with POAL and Oud Satin Mood, it smells so me!!).I want to sell it or maybe swap this Musc Ravageur 50ml I only sprayed 3 times.

Coming back to it around 5 years later with a new-found appreciation for musks, and this one is truly special. Smells fantastic. One of my favorite musks. Very cozy and gourmandish. Spicy, cinnamic, creamy vanillic, fluffy musk. Gorgeous.', 'I am so scared of this perfume. This fragrance almost made me give up on my casual interest in perfumes because I felt like an absolute philistine amateur who would ""never get it"". Everywhere I looked I saw people praising this as masterpiece, gushing over how sexy it is. When I finally got my hands on it I was offended and honestly... angry. It smelled like a being in a stuffy old-money social club in Paris where an old French professor gets too close for comfort trying to put his hands on you after sweating in his tweed jacket for 2 hours during his dramatic lecture. Uncomfortable, libertine and unwelcome.  I kept my mouth shut. Kept trying to give it a chance on the occasional mall run in my imaginary desperation to fit in with the community (I can be cool!! If I like Angel I can certainly like this, right??). It just kept getting worse. It came to a point where it smelled like an animal farm to me with sweetness added as a cruel joke to make you lap it up and splurge your money on it to prove how ""high brow"" you are while smelling like sh*t from a butt. Is this really what people like?  The tipping point for me was when one day, on my way to the gym a homeless vagrant walked passed me and the smell of his soiled crusty clothes made me remember smelling Musc Ravageur on my wrist for the first time. I was done. In the gym changing room everyone was spraying themselves with your average fruity gourmands, your Lancomes, Paco Rabannes...I knew at that point I was simply a hater who doesn\'t fit in anywhere - too annoying and self-important to admit I\'m part of the average public with generic taste, too unrefined to ever participate with people ""in the know"" in an honest way. Then one day while waiting in line at the grocery store (ironically after the gym) I caught a whiff of what I vaguely remember was the DNA of Musc Ravageur and it was...good? Alluring? I had no idea where it came from, if it came from a man or a woman or if it was a dupe (I couldn\'t imagine someone wearing it while tending to their errands but who knows). I\'m almost certain it was from a man because it smelled, dare I say, sexy to me? And I wished it was from a man as a heterosexual woman.  Now I\'m confused. I have yet to test it out again after the last incident. My struggle with this polarizing fragrance continues. Maybe it\'s simply not my cup of tea and that\'s okay. Maybe one day I will understand and become enlightened. Maybe I\'m faint of heart and feeble of mind to develop such a neurotic existential crisis over a perfume. Maybe I\'m bored and Fragrantica reviews give me kick. In any case. 8/10 for the emotional Odyssey and sexual neurosis.', 'With its vanilla claws, its cinnamon roar and its wild amber caress, Musc Ravageur is simply sublime ! Spices bring warmth, musk is a sensual invitation... but not bestial! Some reviews scared me terribly but in reality, at no point does the perfume fall into a ""beast"" smell because the whole thing is a magnificently well-realized waltz; each ingredient is in its place, perfectly measured. To be honest, I even find a little gourmand side to it. Musc Ravageur has a bold, almost erotic DNA, built around vanilla, cinnamon and this sensual musk.  It obviously joins my wishlist and even my favorites.', '9.2/10', 'I’m not so fond of Frederic Malle fragrances, I always find them to be too artistic for my taste. However this MASTERPIECE is something special. Its a classy, mysterious piece of art. And there is something special about it that I can’t quite describe. When I smelled this I took a walk in the memory lane like in Ratatouille. Its original yet nostalgic. Powdery smell done right. 10/10.', 'IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME When we let our imaginations travel, we risk immersive explorations of our memories, our loves and the passage of time through us. We feel alive as we relive our childhood memories and our adult experiences. Part of being human is this fantastic ability to explore themes as we travel through the time and space of our memories, raising questions about the nature of art and the complexity of relationships between love, sexuality and possession over someone we think is ours. According to philosophers, it is this gift that distinguishes us from other animals. Our opposable thumbs are merely an accessory that has facilitated the evolution of civilisation and which we even share with all the other primates who are incapable of dreaming. For me, my spaceship and time machine is almost always a perfume. Fragrances are extraordinary sensory vehicles for our dream expeditions. Some transport us to space... others to time... and some very special ones even break the boundaries of our emotions. Musc Ravageur is one of the favourite perfumes of my imagination. The French word ""Ravageur"" could stand for all the possible meanings of ""devastating"". A devastating love is certainly something we all want, while a devastating pest is something we avoid at all costs. It is a word well suited to extremely passionate states or moods. Musc Ravageur is a fine blend of warm and soft scents with a sensual touch. The spicy-sweet duo of clove and cinnamon dominates for a long time before the velvety soft base of amber, vanilla and musk nuances is revealed. For hours, the vanilla fights its way out of the wooden cocoon to enchant the noses of those around it. The wooden bed of cedar and guaiac wood tempers the sweetness, so don\'t worry, it\'s never too sweet. Personally, I classify Musc Ravageur as more oriental than animalistic. I didn\'t really notice the animalistic tendencies that many people claim. It certainly smells sensual and seductive. The wild animals that are said to be present were well hidden from me. When I first tried it, I didn\'t fully understand the magic behind this potion. I was only driven by the hint of a bold scent. And rightly so, because it was love at first sniff! Normally, sweet scents are recommended for the colder seasons. But not here. Let Musc Ravageur touch your skin, even in high summer temperatures. The scent develops much better in the heat than in the cold. The warmth of sun-kissed skin, natural body odour and this perfume create a wondrous blend in which the vanilla note rises like a phoenix from the ashes. I love its cinnamon boost, seared with a touch of lavender. It smells of warm spices, but never scratchy. Everything behaves completely differently than I expected. The vanilla, amber and musk notes blend together to add a wonderful warmth to the omnipresent cinnamon. For me, the amber and musk notes are the ones that stick in my mind. The vanilla comes through more and more towards the base and dry down, while the cinnamon lingers longer. MY OPINION: Obviously, this is a perfume I recommend. Break the olfactory conventions and dare the leap into the unknown. You may be richly rewarded in the end. Be enchanted by this sensual summer fairy tale. Enjoy it in the colder months too. I wouldn\'t advise you to buy blindly, as all Malle perfumes are quite expensive. Musc Ravageur is no exception. Try it first.

I was always very “powdery” scent averse but this one changed my mind completely and has sent me on a journey to find more scents like it.  The sillage for me is good, but the longevity is an absolute beast. Half a spray on my wrist is still going strong right before my shower 24h later. If I spray it on clothing, it sometimes can still be detected AFTER a wash.  I was surprised to see so many consider it a masculine fragrance but I imagine it comes down to skin chem and preference. On me it smells sooo feminine. Soft and powdery with a hint of creamy woodiness. I got the 10ml as a free gift (thanks Mecca 🙏🏻) but now I think I need the full size. Stunning stunning stunning.', 'Warm, deeply comforting, musky, ever so slightly animalic on paper, aggressively synthetic and sharply metallic on my skin, similar to the way Hermessence Osmanthe Yunnan wore a few weeks ago.

I attempted to stick with it and two hours later I can finally pick up the musk, and the synthetic note is has lost its hard edge.

It´s like a men urinal or some dark city corner, where men go to urinate frequently and the place is sprinkled with some sweet powder and florals. It tends to settle a bit later, as a fragrance developes, but still, I can detect urine very clearly for the whole time of the test. I had to wash it off eventually and cannot stand it (I can usually tolerate a lot as a hospital worker). The urine line is not so pronounced, if you spray it on the clothes.

There are plenty of fragrances that open fresh and juicy with bergamot then move into a woody vanilla base, but through clever utilisation of a host of accords to accentuate and enliven the composition, the result is a fragrance that is unlike any other, something that is entirely its own. It is complex, fruity, warm and spicy all at once, yet smooth and calming throughout, even in the fresher and juicier opening. I can't say that I reach for it often, nor that it is for me applicable in many situations, or favourable over other options on a day to day basis, but there will always be those indecisive times when I wake up and simply cannot pin down what I would like to wear that day, what feels right for the occasion, the weather or the season.

I think she must have worn Opium, which was very popular at the time. It gave her the air of a nineteenth century prostitute. Great teacher. When I first sampled Musc Ravageur in the early 2000s I remember most the musk notes, which brought something novel to the sea of Cool Water copies which dominated masculine perfumes at the time. It was the beginning of the reintroduction of classical French feminine accords to a new generation of perfumistas but I wasn't sure I could actually wear it in public. The musk seemed too poopy, the drydown too feminine and powdery. The hype for this fragrance grew quickly over the next few years, with the bros embracing the skankiness of this legendary panty-remover and never shutting up about it on basenotes. I had bought a bottle by this time, but maybe the hype around it kept me from wearing it. Flash forward to October 2024. It has been raining very heavily over the last couple days and this morning I decided to wear it to work. Today it strikes me as cozy, warm, altogether pleasant and something I'm happy to cuddle up with while the rain pours down outside. The citrus and spice notes are perfectly set against a powdery vanilla-musk backdrop without veering into Christmas candle territory. Sadly, the price has doubled for this fragrance since I bought my 100ml bottle, a wholly unjustified gouging on the part of Estee Lauder and its subsidiaries. I can't comment on the current formulation, as I haven't tried it."", ""every time i get a chance to spray a tester bottle of this onto myself, i leap at the opportunity with pleasure. don't know why i haven't atleast bought a decant of this already..... it is a fucking phenomenal perfume.  as many others have noted, it really is sex appeal in a bottle. it's rich, carnal and seductive. but at the same time it's really warm and comforting. incredibly well balanced. enrapturing from open to fade. incredible longevity and projection... a little goes a long way. i, as a young woman, sometimes wonder if i'm even able to pull it off. whether i hypothetically do or don't, i don't care. i love it and it makes me feel powerful and sexy when i wear it.  i think it is entirely unisex.. would love to smell this on a man."", 'I tried really hard to like this one, but found the scent too thick and cloying..it seem to be a bit of a theme for me whenever it comes to cinnamon, sweet spicy, vanilla combos. Always reminds me of a cheaply scented Christmas candle.', ""This is a narcotic!

It's extremely beautiful and extremely dangerous"", ""I am trying to like this perfume, but can't seem to like it. It's okay, not good, not bad. I don't get the hype for this perfume.

Not great but not bad. The musks kind of clash with each other. Definitely animalic but it isn’t overly done.

I love it. it lasts for hours on my skin, and got me smellin like a snack."", ""Didn't you got it, anybody? It's pure reminder of the YSL Kouros old editions drydown! The same designer even, Maurice the main man!"", 'Almost done with my discovery set of 12 Frederic Malle fragrances! Tonight, the legendary Musc Ravageur. It seems like there is a lot of debate over reformulations, how animalic it is, and even whether Musc Ravageur is a really a ""musk"" at all. To me, Musc Ravageur is more of an amber oriental than a musk fragrance, although there is definitely a dose of musky notes in there. It reminds me of a LOT of other fragrances, but especially Obsession by Calvin Klein (For Her or For Him). I am not a fan of the opening at all, which has bergamot but also a big lavender note and is also very sweet. Then I detect a big dash of cloves and cinnamon which, in combination with the candied sweetness at the top, gives the impression of a powdery baked good. It\'s not gourmand, but it is just this side of that line. These notes in combination also make it feel distinctly 90\'s to me... impressions of Le Male, Obsession, etc. (I read that this formula was a failed submission by Roucel for Jean Paul Gaultier, so it probably is from the 90\'s.) Things get better in the heart. I am noticing that I get a Fredric Malle DNA in the heart of many of these releases. It\'s a DNA that I like, and smells to me like a floral bouquet of rose/jasmine/ylang and a very characteristic cool, white musk. It seems to be in all of the feminine leaning releases, and shows up here as well. In the base, Musc Ravageur is a cinnamon-y, warm amber vanilla with a kitten fur texture. I don\'t get anything, anywhere in this fragrance that reads the least bit animalic, skanky, or sexual. Nice fragrance but it\'s not for me!', 'This is cozy, sweet and musky. A gentle animalic wrapped in some warm ambery vanilla with soft spices and floral elements that make it more palatable. Civet is not listed but very well could be. It feels like a mixture of classic musk with a modern slightly gourmand twist.  I enjoy it for the first few hours, but find it gets tiresome to my nose. Sweet, musky…. sweet musk. Have to be in the mood for it.', 'The dry-down is the best part, a smooth spiced toffee crème caramel. But it’s a busy amber, it’s golden and brown-sugary but it’s so spicy from the cloves, cinnamon and the animal notes that it’s too rich. It smells like a brandy that’s been aged in oak with vanilla, cinnamon, maple, orange, dried fruits, candied nuts, caramel, tobacco and marzipan. To me Musc Ravageur is a reduced brandy jus.', 'If I can only upload a video of my facial expressions as I read the reviews here.  I read many reviews searching for an Arabs/middle eastern reviewer that match my experience because, the smell is so familiar and there has to be someone who wrote about it. Annnnnnnd I found it! @Abdul.b description is spot on! It smells like a cheap middle eastern oil/cologne that old men used to were thinking this is a stylish French fragrance. And yes I said ""used to"" because the smell is linked to my childhood, even nowadays people know better than that, there are new bad cheap fragrances instead... I don\'t know... it is truly puzzling, some people say gourmand!!! HOW? I wish I can experience that.', 'Perfect winter date night fragrance', 'Female fragrance; not for men. Very soft, very light musk. No way it has more than 1 or 2 basic notes.', 'Sorry guys...I did not get the sex vibe with this at all. This is a spicy, creamy, powder bomb. It reminded me of POL as in a sophisticated foreign (ie. not American) mature woman would wear this - on the daily. It is her driver, grocery shopper, after school picker upper. Her distinctive (though not super unique) sig scent. Everyone knows she\'s been in the room...and for some reason - yup...her name is Patty.  ""Patty must be here. I can smell her in the auditorium.""  Not saying that is bad. It just IS.', ""Edit: Based on how this smells on my husband and what he thinks of me when it has fully dried down on my skin (2 hours+) I retract the review below. Fully retract...This is both innocent and otherworldly. Definitely worth a bottle. It's apparent that some of y'all love an excuse to write a smutty novel as a review. Personally, I find this to be a powerful amber spice scent with a strong tangerine top note. Though it can be sexy, it put me in the mindset of Christmas morning as a child, with the hazy amber musk forming a sort of cozy remembrance of times past, eating Terry's oranges and investigating tasty spiced treats. Instead of smelling dirty sheets, I smell cotton nightgowns and undercover breathing while waiting for Santa to be gone. Simultaneously, as an adult, it is a beautiful evocation of anticipating a lovely moment. Smell it and decide for yourself, I promise it doesn't smell pornographic!"", 'I did the test on Frederic Malle\'s website to find out which of their collections suits me best, and Musc Ravageur was one of them.  So I went to smell it, sprayed it on the back of my hand and could literally smell the warmth of hot oil. It sounds strange, but it radiated this kind of warmth. I liked it straight away, but decided to try first before buying a whole bottle. Over the days it grew on me and I bought a whole bottle without realising that I would love this fragrance so much... On me it smells ambery, warm, even powdery and musky. It feels like a second skin and covers me like a blanket. Luckily, I smell nothing dirty.  Sensual, but far away from sexual..I don\'t understand what you all mean. It may be kinda alluring, but in an elegant way. Some of the comments here are pretty nasty.  But I guess there are different perspectives on each fragrance. It is a perfect unisex fragrance and smells feminine and sophisticated on me.  The fragrance needs to rest for a while. The longevity is good and the sillage is okay, but I think it gets stronger with time. It still fills a room, light and pleasant. Somehow I can imagine wearing it all year round.  Musc Ravageur reminds me a bit of Shalimar, just not as vintage and dusty/powdery. (I liked Shalimar overall but too much vintage) I think the statement ""love it or hate it fragrance with obsession when loved"" fits this perfectly.  Personally, I love it with the possibility of obsession. :)', 'This is carnality. To me (a male), and what it evokes. Well, it puts me in mind of diving onto a bed, stripping and immediately going down on a woman -- and then animalistically mounting her. And then the post-coital scent hanging in the room. That – to me and to be upfront – is its essence. At least at first.  I’ve tried other scents supposedly sexual-evoking, including Pappilon’s Salome, Luten’s Feminite du Bois, Histoires de Parfums 1740 Marquis de Sade, and others, but this is the first that evokes raw sensuality. And unlike some of these, this can be easily worn by both men and woman. I consider it entirely unisex.  I also have to note that in the dry-down, say after two hours, the rawness disappears and it becomes a pleasant slightly sweet amber, with more vanilla. Maybe, to keep to the theme, a comfortable cuddle. Cozy and assuring after the pyrotechnics.  Obviously, this is not everyone’s response – and perhaps there’s an element of the power of suggestion but the evocation is there. This is not a blind buy bottle. I also wonder what it might have been like in earlier formulations since some people say it’s toned back on the musc, raw qualities. A masterwork.', ""I bought a sample of this - it's very spicy, headache inducing and nauseating. Definitely musky but not this wonderful composition that I was expecting from reviews. Where is this sex in a bottle I was told about?? Sillage is great and I'm still smelling this 9 hours afterwards...unfortunately *sigh* I'm so disappointed..."", 'I didn’t have the privilege of trying musc Ravageur before Le Labo labdanum as for many people their experience is in the reverse of mine. I thought labdanum was amazing, musc ravageur is incredible. It amplifies the qualities I like in labdanum. The silage is stronger and there is something else I can’t describe that is not found in labdanum. I think musc ravageur just bumped labdanum out of my full bottle wishlist.  For reasons only I can understand, Musc ravageur is like the wilder, nomadic, non-English cousin of the tragedy of lord George. Both thrive in the heat and possibly even more perfect if there’s a breeze at the same time.', ""I believe this is probably the greatest fragrance in its category of all time. While it is a love it or hate it fragrance, when it is love, it is obsession.  It smells like lust. It smells like innocence. It smells soft. It smells rough and dirty. It smells like a rock star. It smells like a porn star. It smells vintage. It smells hip and trendy. It smells light and it smells heavy. This fragrance is a contradiction in every sense of the word.  It is magnificent. I have unfortunately only smelled this on myself. If I smelled it on another person I am afraid I would stalk them and hide in their bushes and peep in their windows. I am not even going to attempt to describe the notes because it is different for everyone. Musc Ravageur is not simply a fragrance, it is an experience. One you will never forget. Love it or hate it, you certainly won't forget it."", 'Rock Rose on a bed of vanilla and cinnamon. I had a cat named Silver, She recently passed away after 25 years on this earth and although I\'ve had people pass that I\'ve known in my life, nothing shook me like her passing did for whatever the reason. Silver loved to cuddle but when she was tired of me she\'d definitely let me know that she was the queen and I should do as she says. Musc Ravageur smells like the fluffy tuft of fur I used to nuzzle right under her neck. I will ""God willingly"" always own a bottle of Musc Ravageur to remind me that I was lucky to have really loved something.', 'A regular gourmand fragrance makes you want to eat the fragrance that Someone is wearing. Musc Ravageur makes you want to eat the Someone wearing it.', 'SoTD - Musc Ravageur by Frederic Malle ""A sensual perfume, powerful yet perfectly controlled, dramatic and mysterious. Composed by Maurice Roucel as an “act of seduction and generosity”, Musc Ravageur is an uncompromising Oriental, which trumps current fads. Its explosive departure of bergamot, tangerine and cinnamon is set against a backdrop of vanilla, musk and amber. A sexy, turbulent perfume, in one word: ravageur."" I can\'t tell you how much I enjoy reading the superfluous, often false marketing that perfumers and brands come up with to describe their fragrances. Partly because I too, am afflicted with the same disease of verbose nonsense, and in part because they\'re often wildly off base, and a less evolved part of my being enjoys laughing at them in secret. However this time, it is all too accurate. Abstractly, perhaps. But accurate nonetheless.  Musc Ravageur is an incredibly difficult fragrance to describe. It is deceptive, and takes great pleasure in tormenting me, and every time I think I\'ve got a grasp on it, something throws me for a loop. Is it frustrating? Hardly. No, the experience is very much enjoyable, like trying to catch a glimpse of something mythical and fleeting. Musc Ravageur is incredibly simple, yet infinitely complex, and it is within the nuances and depth, that Musc Ravageur truly shines and displays itself as it is. And it needs a great deal of observation to truly appreciate it in it\'s entirety. One needs to smell and smell again (hardly a difficult task) to find the bite of cinnamon, the heat of cloves and the deliciously edible vanilla, but the impression, by and large, communicates a delicate mirage of soft skin, silken sheets, cashmere blankets, hushed whispers, and low lighting. It is sensual almost to the point of debauchery. It is warm, inviting, criminally seductive, almost like (and please pardon my bluntness) an erotic novel unfolding on the skin. Truth be told, if Casanova had a fragrance, this would be it. Onto the fragrance itself, in slightly more detail, before my train of thought drags me further off track.  The fragrance opens with a blast of citrus and spice, in the strangest manner. It can\'t be described as fresh, it can\'t be described as spicy. The opening is fleeting, but it sets the tone for this (admittedly bottom heavy) fragrance in the perfect way. It is difficult, if not impossible, to explain how this is the case, but it is. They come, they tease, and then they disappear, giving way very quickly to the cinnamon and clove in a beautiful symphony of warmth. And just as the spices truly begin to bloom, they\'re joined by musks, vanilla, woods and amber.  And here, in the ""base"" is where Musc Ravageur truly becomes the legend it is known far and wide as. Every note mingling in perfect harmony, becoming something that transcends ""just perfumery"" and becomes art in earnest. The spices, the deep amber, the sweet vanilla, the warm musk, makes for a blend that defies all description. The vanilla is sweet, almost like ice cream, and would perhaps be too much by itself. But the dark, almost bitter woods balance it, lending a bite to the base, even as the amber adds depth and gives the impression of a golden twilight on supple skin. And supple skin is truly what shines through as the light dusting of musk makes it\'s way through the blend, trickling through, almost ghostly in it\'s prominence. And the musk itself, while hardly animalic, is far from neutral, just raw enough to pay homage to it\'s name.  The dark, velvety cloak of seduction that one dons when they wear Musc Ravageur is truly dangerous, to others, and to the self. It smells unapologetically of carnality, and unmistakably of sophistication, and in doing so toes many lines, between prim and debauche, between soft and loud, between innocence and sin, and between mortal and the divine.  There is nothing quite like this, to my nose. And I seldom wear it, not for lack of want, but for fear of being enslaved by it\'s soft whispers. I have rarely, if ever, called a fragrance flawless. But to me, Musc Ravageur is just that. True perfection.', 'Hello. I\'m Helsinki, and I\'m guilty as charged. Here\'s my story. I lost my Musc Ravageur virginity this evening while bar-hopping. Thought that Idole d\'Armani or Divin\'Enfant was my ultimate confidence fragrance.  Bollocks. Ravageur is remarkably musky-sexy-magnetic outdoors. When indoors, you get the erroneous impression that MR is stifled and nonexistent.  No, no. All the while it\'s working like charm behind your back. It\'s like a [well-trained] dog. It does tricks that serve and please its owner. Ravageur unleashes its animalistic side when ""hunting"" and also in private. It\'s not loud but therein lies the... devilishness.. of it. The closer, the hotter. Scene #1: A twentysomething couple passes me by in the stairs. The woman turns around and wants to have a look at my shimmering scarf. Then she sniffs at me, asks what I\'m wearing. The next thing I know she kisses me on the lips and says to her boyfriend ""I\'d do her."" Scene #2: This happens minutes after the first scene. I\'m walking up the stairs, making my way out of the bar. I\'m feeling very flirtatious. A man grabs me. Hugs me, presses me against him. (I give in.) Kisses me on the mouth. I smile devilishly and simply walk away. Scene #3: Next, I go to a very loud, crowded and well-lit British bar called ""The Grill"" which I\'ve never dared to go to before because it\'s always full of forty/fiftysomething businessmen. Tonight, I felt like I had the cojones to do anything. (I blame it on Ravageur.) I had a chat with a handsome guy. When I was leaving and intended to give him two cheek kisses, he tried to kiss me on the lips - I dodged. An hour later, I see him at another bar. He notices me, walks straight to me, and kisses me on the mouth. Victoriously, he winks at me. _ Just before saying ""I\'m Katie Puckrick and I smell"", you\'ll hear the words ""When I wear Musc Ravageur, I feel... PRAWW.""  I\'m not a big fan of Katie, but I have to admit: She absolutely nailed it.  Praww.', 'The biggest trap that somebody could fall when smelling so complex perfumes (that belong to \'niche\' level) is to make a quick decision. This one is a quite ""heavy"" scent, that could fit better older men, for sure. But, you have to try it on your skin - always during the winter, 3-4 times at least (and let it dry completely) in order to appreciate it. If i would smell this fragrance 15 years ago, i would have thought that would be rather repulsive. But after some years and entering the world of niche perfumes, i started slowly to understandg the endless stories that the majority of those masterpieces have to recite. And like that, i learned to be more carefull, patient and respectful with these juices...', ""Musc Ravageur is a giant vanilla pudding over which a musk bomb has been detonated. Labelled as unisex, I find it way too confectionary to be worn by a man, and way too cloying to be worn by a woman wanting to be taken seriously. Is it musky and animal? Yes, it is, but in a very controlled and sanitized way. Musc Ravageur is a study in opposites that do not attract. The bakery/custard elements of bombastic vanilla are bolstered by a decorative dusting of cinnamon and cloves on top and around the edge of the serving plate, perhaps using those little twee star-shaped stencils. The musk does little to tame or enhance it, instead it romps around independently adding a dose of stink to a giant gourmand dessert. I think that this is quite possibly the perfect scent for anyone who makes a living by wearing very little clothing and a dusting of glitter. Other than that, it's forgettable and awfully expensive for what amounts to a linear slab of sponge-cake."", ""I am sorry but how can people compare MR with Lolita Lempicka ? I mean not even far away I smell a note that compares to MR. MR is a very animalic, musky dry fragrance, while LL is a sweet and happy gourmand. They smell almost the opposite to me. They are both great fragrances, don't get me wrong, but I am just so surprised people find them similair."", ""I really would love to say something positive about this. For a fragrance that has been the subject of so many positive reviews, this was a complete disappointment such that I need to wonder what I'm missing that everyone else finds to be pure magic. It's probably passable if you want a confectionary combination of scents that smells more of a bakery kitchen than something warm, spicy and woody. The tangerine opening seems a complete mismatch to the remainder of the scent that I felt would have been better if it were either/or. Either give me a sour citrus as I found in the opening and through the heart development, or leave me at a spicy, warm woody and amber combination. For me, it just turned out to be disaster and a let down when compared with all of the hype it receives.  Sorry, but I'll be the dissenting opinion. There's no substance here that I would want, and I'd not view this as the best of Frederic Malle's collection. This is one that truly needs to match your skin chemistry -- I can usually handle anything, but this was a complete mess on mine. Surprising and totally disappointing. Don't blind buy this one, a must-try-before-buy and for me a scent that really only certain folks can pull off. I'm not one."", 'I could not get into this fragrance at all.

With its main notes of sea salt, myrtle, cedarwood, and algae, Acqua di Sale paints a vivid picture of coastal freshness meeting timeless Italian charm—refined, timeless, and undeniably captivating."", ""My first encounter with this house (and it certainly won't be the last). I've been searching for the perfect summer perfume for years, but each one was either too citrusy, harsh, or uninteresting. However, this perfume delighted me, first of all, with the quality of the ingredients, which is first felt, and then with the composition itself. When I smelled it for the first time, it reminded me of bitter lemon, although there is no lemon in the composition. For a refreshing summer perfume that instantly improves mood and boosts energy to the max, it is extremely long-lasting with excellent projection. To me, this is without a doubt completely unisex. Hands down for such a revitalizing magical summer bomb."", 'I have smelled four different seas, and caught a whiff of the Eastern Atlantic Ocean. Acqua di Sale is not marine, except if you mean a marine biology laboratory. I am still desperate for a kelp fragrance, and because Acqua di Sale came so highly lauded, I felt the time had come for a rather pricey decant. Maybe it’s because of the way it was decanted, maybe it’s actually that high quality — but there’s actual perfume oil in it! That’s about all the compliment I can truly give to Profumum Roma for now. This is just a rather masculine leaning (for it’s the standard scent profile for men’s cologne), safe and generic scent at its heart. Yes, there’s salt here, but it’s not the iodine of the sea. It’s chemical, it’s the sea brought to the lab and now there’s no life left in it. Half an hour in, a note that isn’t even listed: the same ink I got from CdG2. Surprisingly, I do not like it. But also something else, slightly less unpleasant to my nose: raw squid. It’s the exact odour that emanates from squid as you prepare it. It’s not a nice smell by any means, but I dislike it slightly less than the lab salt and the ink, maybe because I love seafood and have long accepted the rancid smells they give off before and during cooking as part of a delectable culinary experience. All the while yet another unlisted note: simple musk rearing its head. Close to an hour after the squid, it’s replaced by cheap metal. It dies down soon enough leaving the stage to lightly salted generic musk.  There’s nothing even reminiscent of seaweed in here. Huge disappointment, and as such, huge waste of money when you essentially end up with a rather weak, generic perfume.', 'Realistic ocean breeze. 10.', 'You can tell that this is a quality perfume.

To me this is a myrtle bomb with seaweed and then salt, in that order. Like other offerings from this house it’s one vision and done to absolute perfection. And with that, mrytle is the star with the other notes there in the deeeeeeeep shadows or not at all (can’t detect cedar). There's also a vanilla like sweetness undertone to it that I wasn’t expecting (and usually don’t like) but it’s subtle, natural and works exceptionally well, while not being offensive. I assume that’s also the myrtle talkin’. It also has great performance and projection (for a summer fragrance) which is another constant of Profumum Roma.  This house is at the top of the fragrance pyramid to me in that they always put out high, high quality offerings that capture the most realistic essence of an ingredient. It’s always like having the real thing. With that being said, you need to try them to see which ingredient is the dominant one. Or at least I haven’t tried a scent from them that had a clearer mixture of scents. All in all this is a guaranteed mainstay in my summer fragrance bag along with Acqva Viva and Orangea. To me, Profumum Roma makes the best summer fragrances overall on the market and this is a perfect example."", ""Acqua di Sale knows what it wants to be and excels at it. It's a linear fragrance consisting of myrtle, salty marine/ seaweed notes and a small amount of cedar in the backbone. The opening is a myrtle bomb that projects strongly for at least an hour...

This scent is a breath of fresh, salty air that transports me to a secluded Mediterranean beach. ☆☆☆ From the first spray, Acqua di Sale envelops me in a beautiful marine accord. It's not your typical aquatic fragrance; instead, it captures the essence of sea spray and sun-warmed skin. The salty notes are prominent but never harsh, blending seamlessly with a hint of aromatic herbs that remind me of coastal vegetation. As it develops on my skin, I detect subtle floral nuances that add a touch of femininity without overpowering the marine theme. The dry down is a soft, musky skin scent with lingering salty notes that make me feel like I've just emerged from a refreshing swim in crystal-clear waters. ☆☆☆ What I love most about Acqua di Sale is its ability to make me feel both refreshed and sensual and has become my go-to scent for when I want to feel confident and in touch with nature. It's a unique fragrance that stands out in my collection, and I receive compliments every time I wear it. For women who love marine scents but want something more sophisticated and less common than typical aquatics, Acqua di Sale is a must-try."", ""Cold fresh powdery slightly herbal sunscreen. In a good way. It does not smell like seaweed or myrtle as I know both smells very well (I harvest and cook with seaweed and grow 2 types of myrtle not including its subspecies). It does have a conifer note but don't worry about the herbal part in case you hate medicinal smells, it's very light and tasteful. So it's Not a realistic myrtle or a realistic seaweed BUT it's still a surprisingly pleasant freshie with a relaxing vibe of SPA and some soap product line popular in the early 2000s... Basically a fresh cold sunscreen with light conifer and only a faint and complimenting touch of bitterness, an atmospheric, unusual, likeable unisex."", 'Very realistic salty fragrance but be aware test before blind buying this. This Fragrance is really not for me but try it !', 'I wanted to talk about magic for a second. Every now and then you come across a perfume that, in contact with the skin, in the air, magic happens. Lately, I have the impression that most people in the field (the customers, and subsequently the manufacturers) are looking for performance. The compliments. The beastmode effect. That\'s understandable. Who wants to spend their money, and the smell isn\'t noticeable by you or others? But more exciting (for me at least), to come across a perfume that tells a story. That take you on a ride. Whether it\'s by evoking past memories, or describing future fantasies. Touching deeply. Many perfumes, in the marketing brief, try to make a connection between a story and the fragrance. We all know it. But... when it succeeds in reality, without effort and with a sense of natural quality, then it really is...a success. And if the performance is also great.. Then heyyyy! Acqua di sale By prufumum roma. water and salt. Seemingly simple. The category of aquatic perfumes is vast. And it\'s no wonder that Aqua di Sale has been at the top of the category for many years according to the community\'s discourse.  This perfume should be given a chance.  On first impression it is easy to rush and rule it out, and it happened to me. When I ordered a sample I quickly said no. A year later, I wore it properly and then I understood. This is not a regular Aquatic. The perfume has 4 ingredients: -Salt -algae - Myrtle  -Virginia Cedar  That\'s it. It smells like you passed by the sea, a little windy, and the wind also brings with it a slightly salty moisture, a little fresh, a little greenish/grassy from the vegetation in the area. This is how it opens. Both fresh/watery on the one hand but not (""transparent and light"") and aromatic spices on the other. In the middle there is a dance of the marine notes, the algae, the woods and the myrtle for a good few hours, that gives a feeling of relaxed and luxurious European elegance for a long time. 3 hours after I sprayed 3 times, i was at the beach, it was windy, and from a distance of 4 meters, a girl I know said.. ""Wow, is that you? What did you put on? "". What, do you smell from there? I asked.. ""Sure, ...it\'s gooood"" No wonder in Italy, it is the brand\'s top selling perfume. And in Dry Down, on my skin, I was surprised to regularly get such a cinnamony sweetness, mixed with the woods. It turns out that Myrtle has some sweet, smoky tones, something that makes the perfume pleasant even in the cooler months. I think it\'s important to note that this is a must-try perfume, and not a blind buy. In this sense it resembles Orto Parisi\'s Megamar. They are both in the marine category (not blue and clean) and both perform well above average, in my opinion the Aqua Di Sal is higher quality and more natural in terms of raw materials and the general feeling (the oiliness from the splash remains for about fifteen minutes). Scent wise, they are not really similar (there is a whole discussion on the subject here and on YouTube). The perfume in my opinion maybe leans a bit masculine, although I would be happy to smell it on a woman. it\'s interesting. Pleasant. Each wear is a little different, as each time other facits are revealed from the seemingly ""simple"" notes. That\'s it, I feel like I\'ve rambled a bit, but sometimes when you come across magic like I said at the beginning ,and there\'s a lot of depth....', 'This fragrance is such a beast that it unfortunately is overwhelming to me.

Besides, it is a masterpiece.', 'The scent is like: Lying on a cliff close to the ocean, having fresh sea air passing through a beach, where it picks up a hint of sunscreen lotion from the sunbathers.  This is The most realistic sea air scent I\'ve come across. It doesn\'t just smell like salty water. It smells like all the organisms, plant, fish and other things you find mixed into the smell of the actual Scandinavian ocean (probably all oceans). It is calming, fresh, lively, addicting and vast. First sniff, it was enticing. After 2 wears, i was addicted. I had to buy a bottle, and i Love it. It\'s amazing on its own, but even better for layering. The strong, high oil concentration makes it a great way to give other fragrances a more ""sea air"" scent background.  The Fragrance Never stops. I spray 2 sprays on my neck, and one on a wrist that i rub on the other wrist (as recommended by Profumum Roma themselves).  This is a casual summer fragrance, but strong enough for all year round. Even in the cold of winter, it pushes pretty well. I guess it can be used in a semi-formal setting. Unisex, all ages. It does have a Slight sweet toutch.  Personal score: 9.5/10. It\'s simple.

I see lots of recent reviews bringing up Myrtle which I know nothing about & could be what it is I love about this! It reminds me of going underwater in the salt water ocean and coming up for air out of my mouth first “Of course” & my nose second with that first smell when comming up is the salt water in your nose & throat! So very realistic to me!! I love the star anise & licorice accords in my fragrances & I do sense there to be some of that in this one although I don’t remember it being listed! I just got a good deal on this & I’m impressed & love it enough to get the body lotion off Luckyscent not that this fragrance needs it!

Perfect for any situation where you don’t want to be in a cloud of flowers or spices, or leather etc. it’s very gentle and sweet to my nose. I wish it wasn’t so expensive since I could literally bathe in this stuff. I don’t know if it recalls the ocean or the sea for me, definitely not as much as Megamare. It just smells familiar and safe. I would almost call it a skin scent in that it’s like freshly showered skin with a tinge of salt except it projects more and lasts longer than most scents we think of as skin scents.

I like swimming a lot, even more so at the beach, and as a result by the end of the day my skin smells like algae and a bit fishy.

Camphorous, herbaceous, almost weedy, a little bitter, roughly textured. After the first few minutes it smooths out and more saltiness comes through, with big similarities to Sel Marin lurking behind the myrtle. It's seawater, minerality, and algae, which is another term for seaweed (or maybe it's the other way around). Like Sel Marin it's propped up on a sharp cedar. The performance does seem good, but I prefer the more solar, clean-linen vibe of Sel Marin over this herbal myrtle version. The dry down here feels starchy and herbal, while sel marin feels like salty skin. Unfortunately myself and people I ask are noseblind to Sel Marin or something so it's not a big endorsement of one over the other despite liking the profile more."", 'I struggle to find the promised marine aspects? To me this is red ambery spicy, not green nor blue. I really should start just looking at bottle color i stead of fragranticas definitions.  It’s very flowery, spicy and more ”perfumey” than what i excpect from an ”acqua”. Smells like asian ointment like tiger balm (menthol) applied on burnt skin on a sunny beach. Not masculine just sexless. The overall smell kind of reminds me of that soapy sweetness smell found in Mancera fragrances. Is this a common niche house feature?', ""It's not the sea scent you usually find on a perfume designer, not a synthetic marine scent that's mass pleasing. The opening on this perfume smells like a mirtle that shapes like a spicy herbal scent, imagine a fragrance of ginger mixed with floral. Then it'll slowly tone down and smell the salty seaweed.

This scent is masterfuly blended, doesn't really have that swampy seaweed that some of marine scents have(Sel Marin from Heeley for example). Notes metntioned do not really describe this very well. Acqua di Sale screams luxury, from the packaging, through gadgets (yes in every Profumum Roma box you get a funnel and a small travel container), to the fragrance itself. I will cherish every moment I wear this."", ""Acqua di Sale is perhaps the best marine scent I have ever tried. Salty, aromatic and deeply refreshing, it is a high-quality, slightly unusual take on this scent profile. It is also very natural-smelling, thankfully avoiding the synthetic metallic pitfalls that mineralic marine scents so often fall foul of. There is no calone-esque molecule acting as a filler either. Evocative of a sea breeze, it is a summer holiday in a bottle. As @imnsvgz below puts it, it smells like your skin after swimming in the sea (in the very best way!). ADS is briskly salty from initial spray, cool and refreshing. The sea salt is complemented to perfection by aromatic myrtle, an underrated green floral note that is an inspired addition here. It is slightly camphorous, keeping things very fresh and bracing. As it develops, the seaweed comes to the fore, earthy and salty - a logical addition to this scent profile. It tempers the camphorous myrtle and enhances the salt. There is a lovely mineralic quality that emerges as it progresses, reminiscent of a rocky seaside. Soft woodiness comes to the fore as it begins to dry down, rounding out the base but remaining light and natural. The camphor overstays its welcome in my opinion, lingering until well into the drydown, but this isn't a dealbreaker. It fades to a musky, salty, slightly camphorous skin scent. The performance is impressive, particularly considering its scent profile - sillage is strong and longevity is moderate. A unisex summer daytime scent, this is olfactory art that perfectly encapsulates the sea. It is also quite wearable without being a crowdpleaser - while it is a summer freshie, it is a road less travelled. Profumum Roma's scents might be expensive, but they're worth it - this is what niche perfume should be like. Excellent. 4.5/5."", 'First time i tried it near the sea, the saltiness was too much with combination of salt air from the sea. I give it chance after 4 months, the reason is simply: i wasnt on holiday this summer. It transported me directly to the sea from hot summer city and i was really enjoying this fragrance. The scent is gooood, very goood. Masculine and timeless classic marine scent in very good way. My gf like it too and wear it too.', 'It smells like your skin after you have been in the sea. A very natural salty smell, slightly mineralic - less sharp than Bleu Turquoise by Armani. Insanely good and addictive.', ""Finally smelled this and wow, this really scratches my itch for marine fragrances. Another favourite of mine is Lys Mediterranée whose light floral and sweet seawater spray has become my summer go-to. This is more serious - greener, saltier and with a strong seaweed smell. I get the suncream scent, at least initially. This fades over time but, it must be said, is not a huge downside. Summer fragrances are difficult; you want something that can handle sweat and suncream. In the past I've gone for the oily Francesca Bianchi fragrances since, as well as being summery, they seep into your skin and emerge unscathed from sweat and suncream. This, I feel, would similarly work well against the summer elements. It's slipped to the top of my wishlist, as least as the sun continues to make London unliveable."", 'This smells 99.9 percent like Akragis from Tiziana Terenzi but lasts longer and has more mint.

Also, this kind of reminds me of Brut', 'The bad smell of algae is not worth the money invested.', 'Minty marine that married nicely with my skin.  Doesn’t have the cheap marine note that you find in designers. Smells natural and creates a refreshing breeze sensation.  The mint I get might just be the myrtle.

My first impression to the discovery set was terrible outside of acqua viva. You really do have to give them time to teach you about themselves. I was so confused why they put the scent profiles together the way they did at first. Why is this very fresh and airy but have this... ""funk"" about it? But what I\'m really asking is ""why does this have so much depth"". This isn\'t a mass appealer imo but it definitely is an appealer and is one of those fragrances that will illicit stronger reactions either direction than your mass appealers. To someone that can\'t appreciate it, it will definitely stink but someone that enjoys it will really appreciate how unique it is.  Smells like rich seaweed cleaned by crisp clear seawater drying in the sun on top of a piece of wood or something along those lines but amplified by 10. This stuff is loud. Definitely a high class marine fragrance that doesn\'t really jump out as a ""fragrance"" so much as an extension of self. It\'s got this very interesting balance of what could be considered challenge contrasted with its appealing freshness that would come across to others as being your bodywash, lotion, aftershave, or maybe you just came back from some aquatic activity. By that I mean it doesn\'t come across intentional, if that makes any sense. With Aventus, you know someone is wearing a fragrance. With this, you smell like it\'s more so YOU and the things you do (self care or activities) that has you smelling like that. Very clean scent that I would love my clothes always to smell like, and in that regard I\'m saying it leans toward the linen feel but doesn\'t come across linen-ish at all. You really wanna be cleaned up nicely when you wear this. I wanna say white tee type vibes but you kinda wanna make this a button down tbh. Absolute button down, loose taco meat in the sun type vibes.  Could definitely be considered unisex as there\'s nothing decidedly masculine but it does without a doubt lean masculine. Not a single feminine attribute outside of maybe the myrtle that serves as an excellent accompaniment to the wood because they blend seamlessly. I might even say it comes across a little barbershoppy. Very strong fragrance, sits in the same bracket as Ani by Nishane, maybe even a notch higher. You\'ll be lucky to catch a breath where you don\'t smell it. Especially if you\'re a wrist/arm sprayer. Just don\'t or you will almost definitely start to get sick of it quick. 1 spray is great, 2 nears overspray territory depending on where your other spray is. It is that loud. You\'ll want to go easy just because of the profile of the fragrance as well.', 'To me, it smells like a good, smooth sunscreen lotion.', ""If there is such a thing as young or virgin seaweed, this is it. 🌱 The fragrance is very oily on skin but isn't overpowering.

Calone is mercifully dosed at a minimum for accent (how it\'s best used), and there is an explicable seaside tang that is captured here, somewhat sweet, somewhat pungent, but so pleasant to my nose. It is interesting to note that I also detect the myrtle as mentioned in its pyramid: sweet, fresh, green, camphoraceous, like its leaves under the sun with the herbaceous quality from its blooms. The only other ""saline"" effect that matches this is from older formulation Annick Goutal Vetiver. There is also this anisic undertone to it as it dries down into the heart.

Afterwards, it definitely reminded me of the sea, complete with seaweed, tangy but without the fishy smell. Of skin kissed by salt. It was so intriguing that I couldn't stop smelling it. The next day, I dared to test the very masculine fragrance on my skin. Suddenly, there was a very slight sweetness and I was enchanted! I wonder how much of the fragrance interpretation is also part of the packaging? When I dress feminine, I don't think anyone would assume I'm wearing a man's scent. Only that I smell very unique.

This one has a very fishy vibe in the opening that last pretty long on my skin. Sel Marin also has a green vibe in the opening but in a way like a melon, not a fishy kind and the green vibe doesn’t last long. Acqua di Sale smells so good after the fishy vibe go away in the dry down but it takes so long for it to go away (about 2-3 hours). Sel Marin is much more wearable and also smells so nice in a very realistic ocean breeze vibe. To be honest, Acqua di Sale performance is much better compared to Sel Marin that is very light and airy but Acqua di Sale is just not very wearable to my nose in the first few hours. Its price is not bad too with such performance because you will only need a little to last all day. You can see the oil sheen on your skin that proves how concentrated it is but it’s for different noses who appreciate the fishy vibe or someone’s skin chemistry that don’t amplify the fishy vibe.

Sexy, sensual and provocative. The smell of the summer sea air south of Naples in Italy, on the way to Costiera Amalfitana or elsewhere by the sea under the Italian summer heat.

As Kenzo pour homme, it recreates really well the sea and what it's around it without being an aquatic fragrance.  The lost lasting is brutal.

Like all Profumum the longevity is just amazing.', 'Oh no not good at all.... to my nose this smells like a generic chemical cleaner that’s used for like cleaning interior of cars.  Performance is beast Overall- 4/10', 'The myrtle note—a eucalyptus tinged anise with some sweet clove spiciness and a slight,vegetal-green quality—hits hard in the opening of Acqua Di Sale and dominates the odor profile for at least several following hours. It’s creates a sort of spicy, sweet, medicinal green fragrance that to me, does not seem particularly connected to the ocean...at least at first. But as this accord settles in and loses some strength, it acquires a saltiness beneath it which seems to tie in the aquatic theme. Now, the myrtle has lost some of its spicy, medicinal bite and instead persists as a kind of cool, sweet breeziness, passing above the lower, salty component. It sits here for the rest of its duration, a cool, semi-spicy, somewhat sweet abstract aquatic with a distinct saltiness. In my experience there was little, if any “seaweed” present. I also never felt much of a watery texture or truly aqueous aura as I do with some of the other highly touted aquatics like Acqua Di Gio and Sel Marin. As far as enjoying the fragrance, it was a mixed experience, and definitely below the high expectations I had held for this best-seller from Profumum Roma. While I enjoyed ADS after it all finally settled in, around the three or four hour mark, I didn’t really enjoy the dominating myrtle accord that overshadowed the first three hours. The myrtle, which had facets of clove, eucalyptus (menthol), anise (licorice) and and a green, sort of vegetal quality, was too linear and distinct, and just generally not a smell that I liked in the proportion in which it was presented. A more recent aquatic entry which takes a similar approach, presenting an aquatic theme through a dominant, green aromatic accord, is Amouage’s Beach Hut Man, which utilizes ivy to this effect. While even with Beach Hut Man I ultimately found this green accord too linearly dominant and distinct that it eventually became annoying, I prefer it over the approach Profumum Roma took with myrtle. But, if you’re a fan of Beach Hut then there’s a good chance you’ll also appreciate Acqua Di Sale, and vice versa.  Performance is not an issue, it’s very good. I got about 8 hours of solid projection, fairly strong for about 4 or 5 hours, milder but still quite present for another 3, and then a solid skin scent for another 4 to 6 (so about 12-14 hours overall). The actual spray of ADS has the oily, viscous texture of other Profumum Roma releases so it’s no surprise that it lasts just as long. It seems like 3 sprays would be plenty to get this one working for you all day long. Final rating: 7/10 Though I dislike the dominant accord, it’s a well made fragrance with a solidly presented abstract aquatic theme, and rather unique in comparison to other aquatics I have tried. Edit: Update: It’s only about a day later after my first full wearing of AdS and I decided to wear it again today. I will say this—there’s something addictive about the myrtle despite the fact I didn’t love it yesterday. I find myself enjoying it more this time around, with just 3 sprays versus yesterday’s 6. Maybe less is more with this one? Either way, I’m not ready to write this off just yet and could very well update the final rating at some point. The performance is already there, and it’s well made and unique, if I end up taking to the myrtle then this has a good chance of becoming a nice choice for the the remaining summer and upcoming fall.', ""This is a strange one. The opening blast is marine herby salty ... almost medicinal, then it calms down and you're still left with salty marine with a little fruit in there for good measure.  I agree with JungleJuice, the saltiness is not a far cry from Secretions Magnifiques from ELO (that one has a pitch of 'blood, sweat, sperm, saliva... one spray of that actually makes me gag) but this one is more chill, tolerable.  It has been beautifully crafted, and i do I think it is a 'going to the beach' kind of frag, but not necessarily in a good way.  Longevity is great. Projection is medium."", 'My favorite “going to the beach” Scent. Seaweed/salty/minty... it’s a wonderful reimagining of the clean/dirty paradigm for the seaside set.', ""This was the latest stop on my journey to find the perfect marine scent. Is my journey over? Not exactly. Acqua di Sale is in many ways the best I have tried so far, in that it captures a realistic seaside smell. It's not synthetic at all, and isn't just a salt overload with some fruits.  This is not an aquatic fragrance - that suggests that it's clean and watery. This is very much a marine fragrance. It smell like you're sitting on a rocky peninsula on the med, after the tide has gone out, with the seaweed and stagnant rock-pools baking in the afternoon sun. There's some myrtle trees behind you, perhaps some eucalyptus. Is this a nice smell? On that I'm undecided, but most people would probably say no. It's a complex fragrance, and there are some slightly off-putting facets to it. People often describe something 'fishy' about it - which I do see. The dirty saltiness does trigger something in the ballpark of old fishing boats in the mind. There's also a menthol vibe, as well as a minty toothpaste-type smell somewhere in the background. These both smell natural, and even add to the composition in the picture it's painting. The performance is very good. It is however one of the oiliest fragrances I've ever sprayed (even for Profumum Roma standards), making it feel a bit uncomfortable to wear. The bottom line is that Acqua di Sale is a very natural, questionably-smelling and quite unwearable fragrance. I very much appreciate the perfumery - it whisks you away to distant lands. But I can't call it my perfect marine scent as I would struggle to wear this around others, and maybe at times not really enjoy wearing it for myself.

I do not receive many compliments in general because I'm the guy that always smells nice so nobody bothers to compliment me anymore, but this garnered a couple of comments and all were positive. Of course, a lot of people not familiar with the perfume world just frowned upon the brand name when I answered what I was wearing. Longevity is superb, 12 hours at least.

I cannot recognize a masterpiece but it is a good traveling companion in hot weather. I don't connect it to the sea but to some Mediterranean valley full of rivers. Good."", 'I pick up the four notes listed creating a beautiful and realistic “sea” smell, but I also pick up mint and camphor (so, yes to the Vick’s Vapor rub association). I’m sure this was an innovative creation for 1996, but today there’s a lot of competition in this category. Stellar longevity but at high price (and hard to find discounted) means that I will enjoy my 5ml decant, but most likely will not buy it. Edit: it’s now the next day, I have changed clothes, applied another perfume and I’m picking up strong whiffs of Acqua di Sale. Incredible staying power, and that changes my opinion regarding purchasing. If I find this used or at a discount someday, I wont hesitate to pull the trigger.', 'I am currently in Rome and I was wandering around when I found the Profumum store. I thought, I must test out Dulcis in Fundo & Sorriso! Instead, I fell in love with this one. This was an instant love for me. I am a fan of marine, ozonic perfumes, and I know that everyone\'s interpretation of the sea/beach/summer is highly personal. For me, this reminds me of a breezy day in the Hamptons, Montauk, specifically. I actually love the seaweed and the green notes in this. It\'s so refreshing for HOURS. I sprayed this one on my wrist ten hours ago, and I can still get whiffs of it. Monster longevity and good sillage. It made me smile every time I would get a whiff of this today. To be frank, this isn\'t a ""sexy"" scent, and I can even see how it can even be a little offputting to some people who aren\'t fans of this genre. I don\'t care. I think I will go back to the store and buy a bottle because it just reminds me of such happy memories of vacations. This is to uplift my mood and transport me back to those happy, carefree summer days.', 'Strongly aromatic, I smell a mix of burnt rubber, salt, mint, camphor, cloves, lime and something cumin-y with powdery white flowers far in the distance.', 'I love Profumum. I own a few bottles. I had a sample thrown in on a purchase ironically whilst contemplating a purchase. I read many, to me odd descriptions. Root beer, sunscreen etc - for me the note table sums it up as does a review suggesting it’s like a damp beach towel. Unfortunately for me it also had an unpleasant note of fish, like one washed up next to my beach towel (admittedly I spilt the whole sample on my arm) none the less it was one of the few occasions I had to wash the perfume off. What was left on my arm was more pleasant however if I have to do that I know of plenty other better alternatives. Ironically it smells very much like one f my faves Bvlgari Aqua Marine Toniq which is better all be it poorer longevity. It’s also about the only occasion where I would turn down a Profumum bottle even for free. I feel like a traitor but I can only call it how it is. Happy Smelling', 'An interesting natural scent from the very eclectic and beautiful Profumum line, this perfume evokes the smell of Mediterranean beaches and the seaside. It is a salty aromatic scent that contains only four notes: cedar, sea salt, Myrtle and sea weed. The evocation of the seaside scenery smells are spot on. The perfume has a moderate projection, is clearly unisex and had good lasting power. I love this line and own many of their beauties but this seems to be a bit of a stretch with the price value proposition. But it is one of the best natural aquatic scent ever made and so I finally added it to my collection. Enjoy!', 'This fragrance bubbles up wonderful memories of the sea. The scent is that of a salt, a touch of balmy air and oceanic pine notes. Upon drydown it is very tender, and smooth. A fragrance of seaside comfort. Not a sunny, happy fragrance, but more of waves that are crashing against the cement platform of a beach, with grey skies and an image of iron anchors. It is beautiful and worth every penny!', 'Does no one get vicks/deep heat spray vibe from this?', 'I met a person today that was wearing this perfume, of course i asked what it was and then i kept smelling the wrist of the person No ocean or water or salt or beach whatsoever I got an image of a yellow flower against an amber background, very bright and vivid, like it was radiating aromatic light and energy  Also some random images of summer days, maybe close to the sea but mostly because of the mood and not of the scent itself I would also describe the scent as a renaissance scent, it is very uplifting  I want to get my hands on a sample to test on myself though', ""Sea air! Salty, cold, moist wind off the beach! Spices that add to the effect of an aromatic ocean breeze. I immediately got images of standing on the shore, waves crashing in a deafening gust of spray, sticky skin from from the salt, and my hair whipping around wildly, tacky from the humidity. It all holds the smell of spicy northeastern woods along the shore, seaweed washed in on the tide, and an underlying clean smell of being cleansed by nature. A great perfume experience for the beach lover! Other than the images, it's hard to describe Acqua di Sale because it is so well blended. A little salty, a hint of vegetal notes, a dash of spices and a faint wood create an aroma that makes your skin smell like you've spent the day on the beach. Unisex with good sillage and longevity. I've spent years trying to find ocean scents that avoid the cheap heavy calonic road that most take, and this one is exceptional. Hours into the drydown, the impression of having been walking the beach would still catch me unaware. Love it!"", ""I recently went through a spate of searching for a scent that duplicates ocean water. Not the citrus/white flower detergent scents currently popular as aquatics, but the actual salty, ozonic, seaweedy scent of the ocean, preferably minus the shore garbage dead fish elements. This was recommended to me. It did actually go on like water and salt but as it dries, there's a faint tinge of baby oil. I don't know why it would have that baby oil scent, but it does. The frag lasts all day, and I like it, but it's not worth the huge price tag. I wish the salt water elements stayed stronger and lacked that synthetic perfumed baby cream scent. And OMG the price tag on this. Shocking and overpriced. But I still like it a lot."", ""Straight up flat rootbeer. Not even a remote olfactory representation of the ocean - or anything aquatic for that matter. I love several scents by Profumum Roma, but this one is a massive dud to me, and I'd recommend Bvlgari Aqua pour Homme as a better choice in the genre"", 'If you truly love experiencing the ocean, and not just observing it, e.g., you are a surfer, fisher, boater, etc., odds are you are going to instantly connect with and love this frag - the seaweed note is perfect - genuine but not rotting, and the salt note is spot on marine. AND - it’s a beast! Finally a frag that actually does what they all claim to do - attract those around you to actually smell it on you without having to give you a bear hug or kiss your neck because what your wearing is just a faint skin scent. This one performs! Also you can enjoy it for hours without having to put nose to skin - it keeps faithfully wafting up to your nose hour after hour. Love it. Bravo profumum', 'Too powdery a little bit. I can smell the sea notes first, but this is not the real ""Sale"" perfume to me.', ""Ah, after a few whiffs I can now smell the salt. But like another commenter said, I also get this sassafras/root beer type smell. It doesn't remind me of the ocean so much as going to A&W and ordering a big mug."", ""Profumum Acqua di Sale is an odd marine composition--salty and musky, primarily, but also slightly woody and herbal. The marine aspect is strong, as there's some vague idea of seaweed and even sand/dirt in it. It comes off genuinely mixed in the way that seawater often is. Nothing special in terms of projection or longevity, Acqua di Sale is a performance letdown for a house that generally has a reputation of strong fragrances, which should be an expectation anyway, at $250 for 100ml EDP. 6 out of 10"", 'a very poor performer, Sel Marine is cheaper and far better!', ""Buono,mi piace sa di mare, ma troppa gente a Roma ha questo profumo.Tra i 5 che ho di Profumum lo metto all'ultimo posto.

Does anyone else detect the hint of rootbeer? Smells like play aftershave for a very young boy.', 'Honestly disgusting. Like getting slapped in the face with a fish, while at a fish market by the sea, on a hot summer day. Yuck!', 'Scent - salt, sea weed & cedar.  Season/Time of Day - I prefer to use this one in the warmer months, day or night. Projection - I did get noticed, it garners compliments. Longevity - I get 24hrs consistently.', 'good fan of this house, but the scent is rather disappointing no thick sillage and duration like most of their outings...smells like a n Heeley Sel Marin rip off, but Sel Marin is better and way cheaper!', 'I like this a lot. The iodine of the sea, without some of the other odors I associate with salt water. I get a certain dynamic, tactile presence, and a peppery smell at the base, which I think may be attributable to a dose of Iso E Super. Can anyone with a more experienced nose confirm or disconfirm this?', ""Lately I'm approaching to Profumum Roma, discovering their creations step by step and enjoying them on my skin. So far this one is definitely among my favourites, mainly because it's so different from what I've smelled before; when the person guiding me told me, this is like a walk besides the sea I didn't expect this, it actually feels like a deep breath by the sea shore: fresh sea weeds just brought by the sea and of course the sea salt! It is true that, as with other fragances from this house, you have to wait a while for them to completely develop, be patient and enjoy the process. I would recommend to spray on one wrist Acqua di Sale and on the other one Orangea (from the same house) to get the whole Mediterranean experience, I did and getting the whiff of the orange trees together with the sea breeze...close your eyes and let yourself go..."", '★★★★★ *Updated Review* This became my signature scent. Therefore I had to change my older review and talk about it in a more personal manner. YSL Kouros has been my signature scent, a scent forgotten in time where only vintage versions have the character I need from the scent as the new formula is a different scent to my nose. I needed to escape from the whole vintage hunting activity on ebay and other sources, and find a signature from scents I love that are still in production. A good signature for me is a scent that is capable to offer a pleasing aura during any season and at any temperature. A good signature scent also smells like an aura of indistinguishable notes, a blend of uniqueness (i dont want people to associate me with citrus or leather or any specific note). I have tried (trial means full wearing) all the fragrances of all of my favourite designer houses (Hermes, Kenzo, Chanel, Dior etc.) and many niche creations as well (Heeley, Miller Harris, Creed, L\' Artisan Parfumeur, Amouage, Diptyque, Xerjoff and many, many more) Acqua Di Sale amazed me from the first sniff, only to gradually manage to get under my skin after months of wearing it. Acqua Di Sale is supposed to smell like a wild sea, and one would think that it is a scent appropriate for summer. The thing is, that the scent of the sea is a very personal and specific scent that its perception is relying on many different factors (is it a beach in Greece? Atlantic ocean? The beach in Brighton? What kind of vegetation is by the shore?) A fragrance won\'t smell exactly like the sea, but it will have a character that may evoke that mood or sentiment. To me, Acqua Di Sale smells like a luxurious aura, creamy and mysterious salty minerals with herbal sweet undertones. It doesn\'t evoke an exclusively summery setting as it is a quite melancholic scent in character, and also the outstanding sillage and longevity can shine through even in winter. Out of all the compliments I have received (many as you get noticed due to the amazing projection), nobody asked me ""What\'s that fish scent that you\'re wearing?"" or ""Wow, you really smell like the beach, what is it?"" therefore all the comments and reviews that talk about fish are just imaginations going wild based on the marketing that sets the fragrance in a seaside concept. This scent is an aura, not specific notes. It has a calm and mysterious character. It has a high concentration of perfume oil which justifies the amazing longevity and the price, whereas poor old Creeds that vanish in a couple of hours don\'t. Anything I smelled from this house is of a higher quality, but this one was the one that clicked with who I am and what could compliment my personality.  This costs 170 euros in the Italian boutique and they ship online as well (Harrods sells it for 260 pounds) therefore, you all know what to do. One spray on my chest is enough, so a bottle will last me a long time, therefore I don\'t think it\'s a bad deal after all when many designer perfumes at a price of 80 last me less than 6 months due to respraying after they disappear. People can say whatever, the quality is undeniably there, and if you\'re in doubt, wear a Creed on your left hand and a Profumum on your right and test it throughout the day.', 'Une balade dans le maquis qui domine la mer ! Tout ça balayé par le vent marin.', 'Provato in negozio proprio oggi: pesante, troppo dolce e nauseante. Lo ritengo prettamente femminile. ""Duro-Nasomatto"" é altrettanto pesante, ma vibra. Acqua di Sale inizia con un odore di sale marino, poi immediatamente diventa puzza di pescheria e quando si stabilizza diventa come una crema solare.  PS la commessa in piazza Mazzini a Roma é alquanto scortese.  Nell\'insieme é un profumo che stanca dopo 1 ora.', 'A very interesting scent. Extremely long lasting and have monstrous projection.. You get noticed when you walk into the a room if you are wearing Acqua di Sale there is no doubt about that. However, I think its a type of perfume that you either love or hate, when you wear it you will end up smelling the juice all day long and that could be a bit too much (even my laundry bag smells of acqua di sale when it has a top which i wore with Acqua di Sale in it).  Sometimes it smells like a ultimate beachside salty summer scent and I agree with other sometimes it smells medicinal (something in the line of those muscle injury creams).  I bought a bottle and I am satisfied with it, but would I buy it again? No! Price not fully justified in my honest opinion.', 'Its So long lasting beautiful day fragrance fresh and confident smell', ""Its notes are a déjà vu. Are walking in a heart-breaking august afternoon from your tepee reaching the sea. The myrtle and marjoram and sage that scratch your nose and your calf.  The hot sand under you feet, above your arms, inside to you. And then, when you relax yourself, a scent of warmth of peace of annihilation.  I'm defenceless, unarm...."", 'It is all about fish and sea weed It is the intense version of Lèrbolario Fiorre dell`Onda.they are pretty much the same', ""I have spent a really hot Australian summer day in this beauty today! It has lasted all day, making me feel I'm drying off after an ocean swim, so haunting and beautiful. It is by far the best of these seaweed scents as I call them, makes you think of flopping down on your towel with your nose near the sand, that mineral, seaweed, sun on skin sort of smell. Makes me feel immortal. I bought it back from their boutique in Rome unsniffed....I had picked up a filthy bug on the plane, it was so frustrating as I could hardly smell anything in the bucket list of perfumeries in Rome I had! I knew I wanted the divine Dulcis in Fundo as I had been in on a great split. I decided that Profumum was the Palais Royal of Rome. I walked in and they also had little bottles. I could smell none of it whhaaaa...the lovely lady took pity and said, this is our most popular. I bought the beautiful little 20 mls of Aq d Sale as well as the big one of Dulcis. I wish I had burnt the card and got many more. They are such satisfying perfumes, rich, lasting, each a classic in its style."", 'Out of the bottle - smells like the seaside. On my skin - smells like menthol vapour rub, toothpicks, the dentist, lemon desert of some kind. Not unplesant but not like the seaside on my skin. Really gets up your nose too so be careful with the spray. A pass for me this time.', ""Acqua di Sale makes me think about cloudy days at the end of summer season or about a cold windy winter day spent walking by the shore, it doesn't remind me summer nor warm tropical lands. Because of this I most prefer to wear it on winter time, even if it's good on summer as well."", 'I agree with Gosha, Rebella and CGV: when I smell Acqua di Sale I feel the Ocean, I close my eyes and I remember when I spent 5 wonderful days in Sagres (Potugal), the extreme western Europe, and I see a cliff with a lighthouse and the immense Atlantic Ocean in front of me... No cafe nor cocktail bar in Portofino, just wild sea.', ""I received this in a summer sampler from Surrender To Chance. Would never have been something I would've bought but it is so different and lovely. Has some pine smell that can be overpowering. It also seems to be best kept away from my face. If I apply to pulse points on arms and backs of knees it is lovely. If I apply too close to my face it has the same intensity as Vicks Vapour rub. This scent is so different and lovely I have been reaching for it quite a bit this summer and have received lots of compliments as it is just so different. Very herbal and salty. Great unisex scent. I have applied it to my husband so I can benefit from the scent. Again apply sparingly."", "":D :D !! I'd like to test it ..."", 'I love it. Acqua di sale remember me the smell of the Macchia Mediaterranea when I passed the summer in the Tuscany cost. It is super fresh but in the same time is woody. I love it.', 'Not a typical marine. If I close my eyes there is no sea. Rather there is creamy thickness, oily sweet herb and sports cream. Layered and uncommon.', ""I received this as a complimentary sample from Lucky Scent so perhaps it was mislabeled. I mentioned that because this one doesn't smell like the beach to me but it does smell like something you would wear to the beach like tanning lotion or sunscreen without smelling tropical. This is very fresh and aromatic for sure but I'm not getting the salty brine vibe that I was hoping for."", ""i love the concept, but on my skin after one hour it's just a cheap pistachio softice flavour. very sad."", 'This fragrance is superb in representing the REAL seaside scent. There no coconut or lime in here, no sandy club house cocktail feeling. Just plain salt, seaweed, driftwood. The very beginning of this fragrance is a bit harsh but as it setlles down it starts to radiate the marine feeling for the enitre day. I could detect it even the next day, even if I only used a very little, only few ""drops"", so it has amazing longevity which cannot be compared to Montale\'s Sandflowers or Aqua Motu even though these 3 fragrances are similar to each other and are all of high quality. Heeley\'s Sel Marine or Creed\'s Virgin Island Water have a more tropical vibe while Aqcua di Sale is more Bretagne or Marthas Vineyard type of marine. Extremely good and extremely expensive. Gender neutral as its so natural smelling with a slight soapy vibe to it.', 'Acqua di sale takes me back to the summer. The cedar and pin trees, the sea is juste behind the forest... The air is hot, heated up by the august sun... I love this one. Very good evolution and longevity on my skin. Beautiful! This fragrance is the special one, this is bette to try before buy this ""sea in the bottle"". It depends of the skin chemistry.', '★★★★★ *Updated Review* This became my signature scent.

It may sound quite repulsive, but really there is something clean and green and pure and fresh and...all of it somehow symbolizes the primordial forms of life. Ocean.

This is not aquatic as I have experienced any other aquatic (still water or pretty water flowers or plants. This is not a fragrance for mermaids and no, it is most certainly not ""a warm glowing endearing afternoon lounging at a seaside cafe at Portofino"", Veruska. This IS the ocean. Wild waters.

Fog. Rain. There is no sunshine here. No holidays. Not a trace of sweetness. Except for - perhaps - the natural sweetness of skin freshly washed in sea water. This IS the ocean.

It's in the same family as Calandre etc."", ""Contrary to my expectations and my overall taste in perfume, i am in LOVE with teint de neige. it is as powdery as described and then some, yet it settles into a sweetness that seems to ooze naturally from your skin. the baby wipe comparison is totally understandable and almost anyone that smelled this edt would agree, but it just isn't a bad thing in this case. it's the most beautiful concoction of clean, classic feminine, sweet ultra powdery goodness. also the longevity is utterly insane, incomparable to any other eau de toilette i've ever tried (actually this is the only edt i've loved enough to purchase). so, if you want to diverge from the beastly vanillic gourmand trend and lean into a more vintage kind of femininity and allure, do give teint de neige a try. don't blind buy though, but do give it a proper chance if you have it yourself."", ""It's a classic, the queen of powder. Mature and nostalgic. Even though there is sugar in it, the sweetness is very mild. It will always be one of my favourites. Sillage and lasting power are also great!"", 'when it comes to powdery fragrances i am too specific, it needs to be clean slightly either woody or vanillay powdery not floral powdery and this one is leaning rather verrry floral, quite heavy on the jasmine which is my least favorite white floral note, great longevity and sillage tho but it’s too boring to be worn on its own', ""Identical to Signature Collection's Opal. I bought TDN because I didn't think it would be that close to Opal. I can't detect any difference between the two. Both are very potent but TDN is a nuclear powder bomb."", ""Powdery Floral.

Boy and Teint de Neige are like male and female siblings."", 'Pure powder scent.', 'Not too bad, i. Wish it wouldnt smell identical to baby wipes…..I prefer montblanc signature much better powdery clean elegant smell.', 'The perfect description of this fragrance would be baby wipes. It’s exactly what it smells like when you first spray it. After the cool down it dries into a sweet sugary note that is very beautiful. It’s a perfect clean and inoffensive fragrance. I’ve been complimented while wearing this a lot. If you’re into clean powdery scents that smell like baby powder or wipes this is a perfect scent for you. Personally I think it will be a staple for me since it’s perfect for all times all seasons.', 'The most powerful EDT I have ever come across! This is a gem for anyone who loves powdery and clean scents. In the dry down, the heliotrope shines and gives it a lovely light almondiness. Very elegant.', 'If the Eau de Parfum is a luxurious winter dream, the Teint de Neige Eau de Toilette is its softer, lighter counterpart – equally enchanting, but with a more delicate touch. It’s like the gentle whisper of dawn, where the world feels still and serene, and the snow glows with a soft pink hue. The signature powdery elegance is still here – those refined notes of rose, jasmine, and ylang-ylang that make Teint de Neige so unmistakable – but the EDT has a more airy quality. It’s fresh and ethereal, like the scent of vintage face powder lingering on a silk handkerchief. The musk feels lighter, the florals brighter, making it perfect for everyday wear when you want that regal sophistication without the richness of the EDP. For me, the EDT is like a whisper of elegance. It’s effortless and understated, yet it carries the same timeless beauty that I fell in love with. It’s the scent I reach for when I want to feel polished but not overdone – the kind of fragrance that garners compliments without ever trying too hard. While I adore the Eau de Parfum for evenings and indulgent moments, the Eau de Toilette has become my go-to for daytime. I’ve even layered it with the body cream and powder to add a little more staying power, because I can’t get enough of that soft, powdery cloud. Teint de Neige EDT is the perfect balance of lightness and class – a delicate fragrance that feels regal, feminine, and forever timeless. It’s a must-have for anyone who loves the scent but craves a touch more subtlety. In short, it’s sheer powdery perfection.', 'Old school make up. Powder. Baby. Sweet laundry. Addicting and cozy for some nauseating for others.', ""The problem with this is not the musk. The problem is the overload of sharp balsamic vintage roses paired with the overload of sharp vintage jasmine and the powder creating a jarring mess, plus the sickly sweet green loud scent of the ylang ylang contributing to the vintage character of this. The result is nauseating. The heliotrope just amplifies the powdery old-makeup type of scent, but the main issue for me is the roses with the ylang ylang which very few companies can execute nicely. DUA's ylang ylang for instance is custardy banana-like creamy and indolic like gardenia, while most of the ylang ylang notes in other companies' offerings are the sharp green kind, like orange blossom, leaning metallic and camphorous as in BBW Tropidelic or the overly balsamic loud sweet-green ylang ylang kinda like frangipani giving a 90s dated feel in perfumes. Another one sharp and vintage, a lot less powdery is DUA Fortune Sweets that I got rid of. The powder in this attempts to smooth out the sharp florals but to the contrary it accentuates the balsamic super heady quality of the roses. Cloying and unbearable. At first I kinda liked its old-makeup scent, but it's too much with the rose and jasmine on every layer. The musk and tonka were the only positive traits giving a soapy feel in the later drydown."", ""It starts out as public bathroom soap and cheap floral air freshener, then it turns into a screechy and soapy old-people scent, like a bottle of chanel 5 that's wayyyy over it's due date, and by screechy I mean that the scent is so harsh that it hurts my nose. I tried scrubbing it off, but this one is made to stay, which would be a pro if I didn't absolutely hate this scent. I really don't get the hype about this one... Just glad I didn't buy a full bottle"", 'Clean, sweet and powdery at the same time. I know for sure that I smell nice and clean whenever I wear Teint de Neige EDT. I find the sweetness of EDP suffocating, EDT on the other hand manages to balance everything perfectly.', 'This smells how crushed linen looks and feels on skin. You are either the most beautiful woman in your small Italian town or a demure gentleman with deeper power and influence than you present. Martha Marie from Passion of Mind wears this.', ""Powder, powder and not much else (which was fairly obvious by the reviews tbh). I thought an overdose of powder was what I needed (so I blind bought it), but it really wasn't (so I sold it).

Whoever likes it, I suppose!"", 'my favorite as someone who is in love with the smell of powder...', 'A beautifully sweet, elegant powdery opening.

I love this but I struggle finding occasions to wear this because it makes me nauseous in the heat and I have so many other perfumes I enjoy wearing during the colder months. This is a beautiful fluffy, vanillic, and smooth powder but I could see it being a bit offensive for others so this is really a one spray under clothes type of perfume. I actually like wearing this bed a lot as it’s very cozy and snuggly. Perfect for going to sleep on a chilly night with your warmest blankets and entering into sweet dreams. If I ever went on vacation to a Nordic country and could only bring one perfume this would be it.', ""This is a really lovely powdery perfume.

Beautiful powder bomb!!  I wore this in the heat and it shines!!  No soapy opening, more rose and powder, I thought I had put on Loukhoum. So when I wore it indoors and I smelled soap I was taken back. You wouldn’t guess from the notes that TdN was so aldehydic.', 'This is how I imagine the clouds in heaven must smell! Deliciously powdery, I do not sense ""baby powder"" at all, it is much more ""sweet powder on a pastry"" as described by Lavendery72 below. As the name implies, it does create a ""snowy"" sensation and is perfect to wear in the winter time. I also enjoy wearing it to bed year-round for the sweetest dreams. Heliotrope and tonka lend a hint of vanilla, and light floral notes combine to create a scent that is simply divine! Longevity and silage are excellent!! I recently sampled Angel\'s Dust and noted similarities, but Angel\'s Dust is warm and sensual while Teint de Neige is crisp and cool. Teint de Neige is my very favorite powdery perfume!', 'Absolutely beautiful, Powdery lovers must have! It’s completely feminine but still very comforting for anyone to wear. Initial spray reminds me a bit of Chanel no.5 EDP/Eau Premiere. Bit of Cacharel LouLou. As it dries down it gets closer to a baby powder type scent. Very well made. Nothing wildly complex, just beautiful perfumery.', 'my signature scent out of all the ones i have, clean, mature, luxurious, wonderful longevity and sillage. This one has everything i hoped a fragrance would have.. if baby powder is all you can smell, try this in an odor-free room, in another time. It has depth, but it’s blended so well you need to put effort to feel its layers.', ""Got this perfume recommended to me at a perfumery in Paris called Nose and immediately fell in love. It’s the perfect baby powder perfume I’ve been looking for all these years. I think it helps that there’s no violet and/or iris in this, which is a reason why I don’t like a lot of famous powdery perfumes like Insolence by Guerlain. It's also a lot less one-note than Insolence; you may be able to only smell powder on the first spray of TdN, but I promise you that after an hour you'll be left with a delicious, powdery, floral vanilla! I still have the small sample of Teint de Neige I got from the perfumery and it is lasting me forever. This stuff is potent! I get nose-blind to perfumes so easily but this one lasts what feels like forever. When I run out of my sample I think I’ll have to get myself a full bottle, which might just last me a lifetime with how strong it is!"", 'Nunca pensé que encontraría un perfume tan perfecto para mi.

I’ve never been so nauseated by a perfume. Overpowering. I smell sugar, lots of powder, ylang and rose. Very strong, brash, and outdated smell. The sweetness mixed with the powderiness and the heady indoles (from jasmine and ylang ylang), those 3 intense notes combined together makes it sickening…there’s just way too much going on here. Now, I LOVE a good powdery floral (‘Love, Chloe’ is my signature…well, was, before it was unfortunately discontinued), but this one is a mutant powdery floral on steroids, sweetened with a megadose of aspartame and indoles, and laced with bug spray. The beautiful name ‘Teint de Neige’ had me imagining something ethereal and refined, the opposite of what I actually got, so it was a very disappointing experience. I can’t scrub it off fast enough. I’m extremely tolerant with perfumes, but I’ve finally found the perfume that I would actually find offensive if I smelled it on someone. I washed my wrist twice, wiped it down with alcohol, and I can still smell it. After my rigorous attempts to get rid of the stench, now it smells straight up like sugared baby powder, nothing more, nothing less. If you are a fan of ‘Narciso’ (white cube bottle) and ‘Narciso Poudree’, and you want a much stronger and nuclear version of those, intensity dialed way up, this is the fragrance for you. I dislike both of those, but atleast they are mild and inoffensive. I see now that I have an aversion to ‘sugary baby powder’ type scents, and the type of ‘powdery’ that I’m into is the clean, smooth and musky ‘compact powder’ sort, with something green or citrusy, like Chloe Love, Chanel 19 and Agent Provocateur’s Maitresse.', 'Gorgeous sweet baby powder!! Simple yet beautiful. I also get Lipstick rose vibes just like @nurtenka, but it’s not as mature and vintage smelling as that one. LOVE IT!!!!', ""100% for women.

I had never had experience with a powdery scent. Try as I might, I simply couldn’t bear it and gave it away. Recently, I decided to try a decant. Instant love. Ordered a bottle immediately. It is lovely, though a light hand is recommended. Easy on the trigger.', ""This is an interesting scent. Maybe I am that lucky one who hasn't used any of those powder things people complain about it reminds them. Since I have also tried Bvlgari's Aqva Divina, I find these two very similar, just the LV version smells to be more male. The name itself refers to snow but at least to me, such a creamy scent has nothing to do with snow. There are others that are so much more snow-related like Hotel Cristallo Cortina and of course Demeter's Frozen Pond (they also have Snow which I haven't tried). Some people complain it is linear that it doesn't change but for me this is definitely a plus: if I'd use it to go out, I'd like to know immediately how it will be later too. Since I had just tried LV's Yerbamate before TdN, I also recognised certain similarity between these two. Maybe the similarity is on the level of perfumer/producer. By the way, this is the scent that LV himself mentioned as an answer to a question which of his scents have gotten least attention while they should've had more (it was in a YouTube video). In total, I think this is an interesting scent but LV's Yerbamate is more interesting."", 'Wow This is powder in a bottle  As much as I tried fragrances that are marked as “powdery” nothing comes close to this one When I sprayed it on a friend of mine the first thing she said was “baby powder” Considering the concentration as an edt the performance was impressive yes I did overspray but it was worth it  It’s a scent that you choose to wear not what influencers call it as a dumb reach I actually enjoyed it very much', 'A lovely powdery fragrance! Very elegant. The powdery notes overcome all the other notes, but they are, still, distinguishable. Especially the Tonka, which gives it an almond vibe, then the sugar is very powerful and realistic. 10/10.

It lacks depth and warmth. This is what you smell when you get around people who just washed their hands or their outfits very thorough.

This makes me think of a big 80s wedding cake, but with frosting made of talcum-powder buttercream. So thick and so cloying. I do like it, and yet it kind of makes me feel as ill as the thought of eating that baroque, nightmarish cosmetic-cake.', ""much sharper and denser and more mature than anticipated unfortunately, i was expecting a strong but soft scent, this isn't soft at all😔"", 'Talcum powder.', 'The epitome of powder, Lorenzo Villoresi elevated this element to the nth degree with Teint de Neige (""the complexion of snow""), and I agree with Neil Chapman (Perfume: In Search of Your Signature Scent) in that it is a boudoir scent, and I for one love using this swaddling, huggable scent as a ""nightcap"" fragrance, one to apply just a bit after getting into my pajamas. Just a bit, because, even as an EDT, this one has a considerable aura to it: a little goes a long, long way, I assure you. The accord is built mostly on heliotrope and rose, elevated by ""cloud 9"" musks. There is a thickness that may be overwhelming for those who can take powder in moderation, but for those who find comfort rather than suffocation, this is more than worth the experience. Dreamy ivory, tonka meringue, whipped and puffed and drifting, this narcotic has a long half-life and traces remain on my skin as I awaken the next morning.

And in a way I think it is. It is a powdery puff of a rose, ylang ylang, jasmine bomb surrounded by a hefty bit of musk a little bit of tonka and a bit of sugar as well. And it stays pretty much that way also throughout the drydown and weartime. Which is excellent by the way for this fragrance. As well as the projection. There is nothing mild or irisy like here. But what it however is on top of the strong “flower powder” experience is however also a hefty amount of soapy ness. Almost a little too much of that for my taste. But if you love soap and powder together then this is it!  The soapy ness irks the wintery experience of this a little bit for me. Neige means snow in French and teint means skin or hue, so they are clearly trying to create a sort of snowy wintery vibe here which would work really well i think if it wasn’t for the soapy presence that sort of moves the experience from a snowy winter wonderland to a bathroom kind of experience… which kind of puts a little dent in the illusion for me…  And the soapy ness also lingers on throughout the dry down.  But if you can look past that I think this is a little gem still. At least it is something different from most things I have in my collection. And a welcome change of pace from more common fruity sweet floral compositions. And also a change from the more common powder Iris combinations too. ❣️', 'A couple of months ago I was in Dordrecht, Netherlands, and stumbled upon the cutest little boutique specializing in Italian niche perfumes.

I do not understand why the official website is so short on information about the pyramid. I've noticed almost everyone is doing that now. It's wrong in my book.

Warm and almost delightful. I own both this and Junoon and I believe that TdN smells like baby powder at the opening while Junoon smells like baby wipes. But honestly they dry down to something quite similar, so you probably don't need to own both. I believe that TdN is smoother but Junoon lasts longer. I will enjoy switching between these two to make sure that they last. If you are not able to get TdN because of price point but have access to Junoon, don't feel like you're truly missing out because they're similar enough overall.

This was a blind buy and if I had to do it over, I would opt for a travel size sprayer or the solid. As this is such a strong perfume very little is needed to smell great. That's something to keep in mind when considering a purchase. If you've never tried this, I wouldn't recommend a blind buy either.

Secondly, beast of a perfume?nope, not to me anyway...I can get whiffs of it, especially if it is sprayed on the clothes, but its sillage isn't that strong (in fact I had to smell close to my skin to discern the notes underneath, as what I was mostly picking up was sweet-ish baby powder). Close to the skin though, I could pick up a spice undertone which is probably the tonka, which on me smells like the mahlab spice (I do not know if tonka in real life smells like that). I also pick up a soft powdery rose, and a white floral, that for the life of me I cannot get that it is jasmine. Second day (today) that the perfume has aired a tiny bit after first spraying it for the first time, and I pick up more of the notes with one tiny spray on the skin - I get a whiff of the ylang-ylang, again, close to the skin. Does it smell better the second day?Oh yes! My full review in fact will come after I have let it air for some weeks. Now, I do have the edt, which has a differentiation of notes from the edp, which funnily enough Fragrantica gave it its one space, just yesterday, when I got my perfume, as when I was looking it up the previous days to decide if I would buy the edt (yes, this was a blind buy), the edp and edt were put together on this page only. Now, there is the edp page with no reviews as it is new.I have also blindly bought the edp, and will write about that as well as compare the two. Keep in mind that I am testing this in practically summery (with slightly dropped temperatures) Meditteranean weather, and I am sure this one is better suited for colder seasons (proper autumnal weather and cold winter), so I can't wait to see how it performs. Can it be used in warm weather - yes, but it depends on your skin.Mine, tends to eat a bit perfumes, so stronger perfumes behave more mildly than on other people I think, so I think I can pull it off. Is this one considered a strong perfume in the strict sense of the perfume-used words?No, but it is its powdery aspect that makes a bit to much and a chocking hazard for some as I have scrolled through the reviews. Was it a chocking perfume to me when I sprayed it extra?No, but it did became unbalanced as to the notes you perceive. As it is logical, this one isn't for people that don't like powdery perfumes. Now, there is the floral-powdery that comes mainly from flowers (iris etc), the added powdery notes kind of powdery perfumes that smell dustier (and sometimes bitter)-with artificial baby powder and/or almond notes. And there are the powdery perfumes that smell like cosmetic face powder (still trying to find that white whale of a perfume that smells like the expensive high-quality aromatic puffy face powder of the belle-epoque).Some people also mistake as powdery the lipsticky kind or doll-head smelling perfumes - sorry, but that, isn't considered 'powdery'. Some even confuse the creamy perfumes as powdery-nope, that isn't powdery either (powdery nuances, I'll accept, but characterising it a powdery perfume in general, nope). This one is on the second category in my opinion, the dusty baby powder one, mostly.  Personally I am still looking for that wow high quality face powder of a perfume that is paired with soft florals like iris and perhaps a hint of rose that I'll allow -LOL (since rose isn't of my favourite as a main note-in fact if it is jammy I usually hate it as I find the whole contortion unbalanced). Judging from testing this just the second day, this one, will show its true beauty as it rests and airs (I can already appreciate it way more than the initial testing spray). It already projects more and unfolds better.So, my edits on this review, will be added on top, when I am ready, and I can hardly wait to test it thoroughly, as well as the edp! :) ps: almost forgot to mention, that according to a small folded leaflet included in the package of the perfume, where all the Villoresi perfumes are mentioned with their notes, this one, has the following notes: floral notes of jasmine, rose, ylang ylang, sweet and powdery nuances on a base of musk, tonka beans and heliotrope"", 'Vanilla extract baby wipes', 'Lorenzo Villoresi Teint de Neige (2000) - liquid powder - @lorenzovilloresi ‘s perfume could be the most powdery fragrance I own. This perfume is devoid of the usual Iris suspect, but a combination of Rose, Ylang, Heliotrope and Jasmine that makes the perfume talc-like. As it ages on skin, I get this sugary note that resembles Tonka bean mixed with an angelic white musk accord. It needed the white musk as that created the canvas for the florals to settle.', 'Rose / white musk powder explosion. Comforting and clean. ( EDIT )  After months of use, while still beautiful for what it is, its quite unbearable to me. I tend to let a perfume live with me to make a final call. Will i be buying another bottle ? Absolutely not. Is it bad ? Nope. But its alot. Too much to keep up with. The powder is too powdery, you can feel it on your teeth. Its like chewing on a4 paper. If you are a fan of musky floral thats heavy on the musk / powder, this is for you. Every person will smell within several feet of you.', ""Ah, this scent is heavenly. :) Extremely powdery (but more soapy-powdery, definitely not like Iris by L' Erbolario which is rather vanillic/sweet, I barely notice any sweetness in Teint de Neige, maybe if so then only a tiny little bit in the drydown). I have EdT but it's longevity and sillage are wonderful (pretty noticeable by other people when one is wearing this). What I smell there is something slightly citrusy in the beginning, then delicate rose/jasmine soap, covered in (maybe make up) powder, and in lots of it. :) It's not a cheap scent but it´s definitely worth the price, trust me. The drydown is slightly similar to Iris from L' Erbolario but overally I think you can definitely have both as they are still very different. Also, I don' t think this is a safe blind buy (though I personally bought it only based on the reviews here, thank you, people from Fragrantica :) ), unless you are a hard-core fan of powdery scents."", 'My favorite powder bomb ever,I wear it everyday after shower .amazing ♥️♥️', 'Unabashedly powdery, blissfully vanillic, with soft floral undertones, this feels like a return to childhood and carelessness. I dream of having the whole bath product line, which includes a powder puff, and using it to soak in the tub, before tucking myself to a blissful sleep. It conjures images of perfectly made-up pin-up girls from the 50s or a baby getting ready for its first communion. Powerful stuff, too, it stays on skin and fabrics well into the next day.', ""Twenty years ago, already. It made a statement when it was first issued, and was a bestseller at the time (at least here in Italy).  This is considered Villoresi's masterpiece, for a reason. It's not simply an Iris scent (of course Iris is the predominant note) There is a rich vanilla note (or tonka bean as it may be) that grounds this scent, together with a powdery rose and heliotrope notes. Similar vibes are found in Ombre Rose by Jean Charles Brosseau (this one is sweeter a rose), and Kenzo Amour. The closest dupe is Iris by l'Erbolario (not sure if they produce it nowadays?). But Teint the Neige is so well consctructed and blended that stands above any other powdery fragrance.  More suited to cold weather than warm. A cozy scent for winter days."", 'I do not understand any of the reviews that point out there is vanilla or sweetness to this fragrance. I have been using it and repurchasing many bottles since 2012. I myself absolutely abhor any kind of gourmand scents and even a slight whiff of candy cane sweetness would make me literally vomit. There is no vanilla here or at least not the one you encounter in artificially flavored ice creams. Have you ever smelled the real thing? There is no sweetness to it at all. What it does have is a generous dose of tonka bean and heliotrope that create that powdery feel, but to my nose rose is quite dominant from the beginning. There is a heavy dose of very clean musk and aldehydes that we usually associate with baby wipes, but there is so much more to this perfume. Personally, I do not think it resembles Johnson&Johnson products. It blooms beautifully and is suitable for any season, but it definitely is not a safe blind buy. You really must test it on skin. If you consider purchasing, go for the Edt. Tenacity and projection is extraordinary.', ""Oh my lord. I made blind buy. It was risky of course, with such an high prices item, but well yeah, I can say that I bought 1 bottle of liquid powder. This is POWDER. So much powder and stays forever on your skin. Not hours, not days, she stays weeks on your clothes. After 8,10 hours she goes more sweety in a very feminine way. I love this perfume, and I'll search similar scents like this.  Buy this one, you'll never regret."", ""This parfume reminded me; Johnson's Baby's cleaning wipes.And i decided to i'm not want to smelling like cleaning wipes."", 'Such a fantastic fusion between musk, powder and heliotrope. Not exactly cosmetic powder and not really baby powder. Depending on temperature it projects from ice cool rose talc and warm slightly incensy powdery cosyness. It has a sweetness but is far from gourmande style - more like musky sweetness. In colder weather I mostly enjoy the cool rosy talc powder. It has a timeless and classical quality and it smells so clean and refined.  The musk, warmth and sweetness seems to project better in warmer weather. In fact this is the best non-dirty musk I have ever encountered.  This beauty is so clean and refined and still has something untamed - something fleeting. The swings between cold and warm and cold keeps me smelling all the time.  Better than I ever expected. I have both EDT and EDP. EDT is more musky and EDP is more heliotrope - but the differences between them are minute. Longevity is better with EDP.', 'Magical perfume. I adore it !! vert powdered but fantastic smell ans sillage. Very long lasting. Its one of the best frangrances', ""There's something about the way this one is blended that I just don't like. Normally, I enjoy clean white musks. And normally, I adore powdery fragrances. This smells like a combination of the two trying to compete for top spot and they just clash together on the skin. The musk winds up being a little dusty from the powder, and the powder loses it's fine-milled creaminess due to the overbearing presence of the musk. As it dries down, it does become sweeter, there's a nice light dollop of vanilla, but by this point it's so weak in the sillage department no one, including myself, can smell it anyways. I'd be a bit more outraged if I'd blind bought this (I've considered it before) but I swapped for it so I do feel a little relieved that I'll most likely be able to pass it to a new loving home without much of a financial loss. For those who enjoy white musks and soft billowy powder fragrances, this may be just the thing for you. It just went so blah and boring on my skin. I will clarify that I have the EDT, maybe the perfume version is stronger, better performing, and has more pronounced notes? I'd have loved to smell some floral notes in this, any florals at all. I just get a very nondescript generic aroma."", ""Powder Power. My very brief summary in two words. I had no advanced idea what this perfume is about as it was a freebie sample thrown in with another purchase. And until yesterday morning, I had no history with the brand Lorenzo Villoresi.  In my rather large collection—almost 200 bottles— I have one other powder centric perfume Guerlain’s L'Heure Bleue. I like to wear L'Heure Bleue in the winter time right before I go to bed. I enjoy others in the genre, like Prada‘s Infusion d'Iris, but powder is not dominant. Teint de Neige is powder, powder, powder. And more powder. And it’s lovely. After I looked up the notes, I believe I can also smell heliotrope, musk and tonka. As expected, it’s a linear scent, just losing strength along the way. If I had to pick an energizing daytime powder perfume, that honor would go to Teint de Neige. Performance for an EDT is off the charts, in both projection and longevity. My husband could smell my perfume on a different floor in— some 40 feet away.  Until yesterday, I did not think I was a big fan of powder in perfumes."", 'It’s not listed....but is there a milk note in here? Its a milky powdery floral to me. It’s a nice fragrance, comforting....smells like a maternal figure.', 'Powdery, flowery, and just overall so lovely! On paper, it\'s straight-up linear baby powder, so this one HAS to be tested on the skin to appreciate it\'s beauty. Whereas Frederic Malle Lipstick Rose is the quintessential lipstick scent, Teint de Neige achieves the same in being THE best ""cosmetic powder"" scent that you can buy. I\'ll admit, even though I had tested this one in the past and was fairly certain it was a love, I was still a bit concerned about the dreaded ""sugar cube"" note in the pyramid. To my relief, this really isn\'t that sweet, especially when I compare to the average syrup level that is injected into today\'s modern perfumes. So thrilled to have found this for an amazing price, but in all honesty, I think the current market prices for this fragrance are fair. Lorenzo Villoresi perfumes are exceptional quality, and they won\'t cost you half of your rent/mortgage to acquire a bottle.', 'This is a must have if you love powdery scent Is very elegant and soft , I m surprised I found this in the men section in the department store. I found out online this is more towards to the female fragrant. it last whole night. I m going to buy it.  It soften my mood, and I m enjoying my inner peace when I first met this scent.

Gosh, I'm not sure what to add that's already been said about this powdery beauty. The name totally suits it; it's like a snowy, fluffy cloud of powder enveloping you. I get a slight bit of sweetness with this too. Long lasting and a great cuddly winter perfume.  Now with the comparisons of L'erbolario's Iris. I also own it as well. They smell very similar to one another, although not identical. I will say, if you're hard up for cash, do get L'erbolarios's Iris as you won't be disappointed in it. Both are great fragrances, though!  Teint de Neige is a must if you love powdery perfumes."", ""I, too, have been waiting and saving up for this fragrance for a long time. Man oh MAN. It's the perfectest, sweet powderiest, dream! There's a touch of spice peeking through every so often on my wrist, very subtle, not listed in the notes. I will cherish this. Lol! Great blind buy, thank you all for your reviews. Very helpful in my decision."", 'So very powdery, sweet marsmellowy powder overpowers both musc and tonka bean until there is only a sweet powdery cloud around, for as long as you would have it and only in winter, it is even more beautifull outside in the cold. Did I mention that it is very powdery? Good, because it is. Teint de Neige translates quite romantically as ""the color of the snow"" and I imagined for a long time that it meant freshly fallen snow in winter, but failed to make the connection. In reality it refers to the snow white complexion that was praised in the Belle Epoque and was achieved by an excessive use of face powder. Now it makes sence. If you have worn it once, you will remember the scent forever and never mistake it for anything else.. until you come over Montale - Sweet Oriental Dream, - exactly the same fragrance, same behaviour, slightly more affordable in a less stylish bottle. Shocking, what if there are other imposters. As much as I love Teint de Neige, I only use a miniscule amount of it every winter. It is an addiction, I need a wiff, just to freshen up the memory, take it with me for a walk in the snow. It craves fresh air to shine.', 'First gut reaction: ""Angel\'s Dust"" from Francesca Bianchi and ""L\'Eau d\'Hiver"" by Frederic Malle / Jean-Claude Ellena -- somewhere in between, the caressing smooth heliotrope of the Malle and the powdery floral of the Bianchi. Truly lovely imo (I have the edp). Also brings to mind ""Ombre Rose"" by Francoise Caron / Jean Charles Brosseau, not exactly the smell (Ombre Rose is more \'plasticky\' and this is more \'chlorine\') but the powdery floral. Maybe one could say the texture is similar...', ""I just got it today and I have to share my excitement. It's THE fragrance I was looking for since I was 9! My teacher had an amazing perfume and I was so shy to ask her what it was. After a long time of searching I finally found it also thanks to nice people from Fragrantica.

You will absolutely get noticed and depending on how people feel, you may get positive or negative reactions. In my case, all positive. I have the EDP version. I don't get any chlorine, but I do get a big poof of sweet rose scented powder. In the dry-down I get more powder + more powder and musk + more powder with some rose. This stuff will last all day into the next day. It lasts forever on fabric. Of course I did go overboard and use 3 sprays and my goodness...just don't. By far its the strongest scent I own.

Proceed at your own risk. ;) \u2028I happened upon it some years ago, by accident. Picture this: one cool sunny winter late morning in Rome, the air is crisp but the sun has a touch of warmth, we're close to Christmas so decorations and lights are on and the atmosphere is festive. I was walking on a street full of shops when I suddenly marched into an old, slightly upscale, and very well-known perfume shop, went to one of the sales assistant with a request: I told him that I recently tried Prada Infusion d’Iris, liked the cleanliness and soapiness of the scent, but was very let down by the appallingly poor staying power (especially when compared to the price). Would he be able to recommend a similar perfume that wouldn’t be gone after an hour? He asked me a few questions, I mentioned, incidentally, that I tried and liked a lot Bas de Soie by Lutens in the recent past but that was not quite what I had in mind. If by this time you’re thinking how on earth can you go from Infusion d’Iris to Teint de Neige that have almost nothing in common but the iris note I would agree, but bear with me. I cannot praise enough how the sales assistant read me and listened to me, because he not only took in my appearance - brunette, mid-20s, red lipstick, cat eye, minimalist dark clothes, red wool coat - but also saw deeper than that. I have some friends that jokingly call me Diva, which I am anything but by the way, it’s just I am a little aloof when you first meet me but then I warm up. Anyway, he anticipated my needs and introduced me to something I didn’t know I liked myself: powder. I mean, I knew and I even loved the smell of talc powder, ten years before as a teenager I had briefly been obsessed with Bvlgari Petits and Mamans, what I mean is that I was not aware of my love for powdery scents on a conscious level. He said after a while that since I said no to Bas de Soie, which was one of his first choices for me (he definitely picked on the aloofness there), he was going to go on another route. We talked a little and eventually reduced the samples to three: Lutens Daim Blond, Teint de Neige and a third scent that for the life of me I can’t remember. After smelling them on the strips I discarded the forgotten third and spritzed the other two on the skin. At first I liked them both but almost immediately got the apricot in Lutens and I’m not really a fan of fruity perfumes, so that was more and more a no every minute that went by. On the other hand, with Teint de Neige, in addition to being love at first sniff, the infatuation grew with the passing of time. I didn’t buy it that day, the very competent shop assistant advised that I spend the day with it and see how it evolved on my skin. Not only it evolved beautifully, I could still smell it the next day after a shower. I went back a week later and got a bottle. Now it’s become my signature, I wear it almost every day, in winter and also in summer because I don’t believe in the seasonality of scents (sorry not sorry for the people around me), and although I refrain to perfume during daytime in summer it’s not really out of concern for the others, just for fear of the perfume reacting with the light. I am vain and selfish like that! ;) \u2028Sillage and staying power, for me, are huge to the point that the more aware people recognise me by it, like I went to a party at a friend’s house and the hostess, that knows me quite well but didn’t know I had arrived, asked from another room if I was there only because she recognised the trail of perfume in the house. Christmas time a couple of years ago I went back to see my parents and at night, when my mother hugged me at the airport said she missed my perfume (as well as me lol) which I applied in the morning, and then she said she smelled it again the next morning when I walked in the kitchen for breakfast. A lot of people commented on it when I enter a shop or on a train carriage. In conclusion, this perfume now it’s become me, I inhabit it, it’s a million things to me, like lace lingerie under a comfy cashmere jumper, it’s old and new, a silk vintage dress worn with a leather biker jacket. I’m not saying it’s a complex perfume, or a revolutionary concept, I think I feel this way because I identify with it so much by now. And even if I know it’s ridiculous I feel like it’s mine and mine only, also because I’ve never walked past anyone else who wore it. I think I also like it so much because it compensates my aloofness, as if with its powdery sweetness told other people that I’m not the Ice Queen that I might seem at first. Ultimately I think that was my unconscious reason for writing off Bas de Soie from the start, that’s one perfume I like a lot but probably fear it would play too much into my perceived standoffishness. One last thing: yes it’s true, Iris by L’erbolario, which I would have loved to love since Villoresi is not really in my price range, is almost the exact copy, albeit much flatter, but compared side by side with Teint de Neige smells so cheap and chemical and plasticky it literally hurts. Back when I still lived in Italy it was not unusual to walk past women doused in the knockoff, it was very popular for a while but, dear oh dear, the headaches that I got smelling that!"", ""Fragrance world is a very huge,mysterious world as you know,lots of scents,lots of variations,lots of changes in one taste during time,lots of masterpieces,lots of nice but unoriginal perfumes that sometimes we use and need more than masterpieces,it's really difficult to name a perfume as best perfume of my life,maybe not that difficult for some people,but for me,it's almost impossible,because I'm only 25..and just God knows how many works of art are gonna appear in next 50 years(in the case that I live that long)after owning almost 200 different perfumes from celebrity to niche,from classic and discontinued ones to moderns,I'm still amazed by any pretty scent I smell,try to seek good aspects of any fragrance,not weaknesses,and I believe this optimism is a gift..if I want to name a perfume which I love the most(till now)it is teint de neige of lorenzo villoresi I don't have a specific taste in perfumes,I'm a vanilla lover,I'm a rose lover,I'm a floral fan,And also I'm a powdery scents fan And this is modern queen of all powdery scents(classic queen of powdery scents is guerlain l'heru bleu in my eyes) I've recognized some people don't like powdery scents for they find them too dry in a chocking way,other ones dislike powdery fragrance because of cold,old,musty vibe they associate with powdery perfumes.non of these are the case here.it's not like a mashed chalk,dry.as it's not cold or soulless Teint de Neige has almost everything I love in a fragrance,it's sweet,in a delicious way,it's warm and cozy and still there is a hint of cool freshness in it,there is a hint of rose here sparkling,there is lots of powdery musk here,clean musk and there is powder,lots of powder,prettier than what any powder fan can imagine,it's powderyness is heliotropes powder(did I mention I die for heliotrope?) a soft,sweet,fluffy powder that doesn't fade,as it's warmed by your skin temperature this heliotrope blooms and blossoms more and there is a cloud of this powder surrounding you for long,long hours..teint the neige is a born when gourmand deliciousness,soft floral heaven and clean powder puff meet each other so it's gourmand,floral and powdery st the same time...innocent as a baby,soft as a baby skin,sweet as a baby..that's why teint de neige is my darling baby  Longevity and sillage are decent,recommended to all sweet powder lovers Thanks for reading this long personal review,and excuse me for my bad English  ❤❤❤❤❤"", 'Teint de Neige is perhaps the best known fragrances and sold Villoresi. The opening is floral, a sweet spot (the hue of heliotrope and rose with a sudsy point is the most distinguished of all the floral notes), here and seen as characteristic of this fragrance is that agreement atalcado a cocktail of musks, everything feels very soft, white, warm and comfortable, exactly as if you were lying on a cloud with a down pillow. The fragrance feels fairly linear, good quality, good length and wake. I personally find it more a fragrance that deliberately turns to female tastes, and although the composition is not spectacular, is resultona and very versatile. If you like fragrances where you want to smell like baby powder scented very fine and expensive, this can charm you. As a special I was surprised that the line Teint de Neige is totally complete, it has a lot of things and is very well: the colony in various sizes, powders, gel, soap, body lotion, etc. Rating: 6', 'Powdery and sweet, with a musky yellow floral underneath. My initial impression was ""no thank you!"" since I\'m not overly fond of powdery fragrances but as I stayed with it grew on me. It\'s an amazingly well done fragrance, very old school and feminine. There are shades of Sublime and Boucheron. The powder is the most prominent note but the musk and ylang ylang give it an almost leathery backbone that keeps all the powder and sugar from turning into a marshmallow puff of nothing. I still feel that it\'s not exactly to my taste but I can\'t deny that it\'s beautifully done.', ""This is one of two fragrances you must own if you love powder.

This in the EDT sprayed with a light hand is gorgeous. I can\'t imagine how the EDP sprayed heavily would be bearable, for me anyway. It smells well obviously powdery, clean, musky, marshmallowy ( is that even a word?!) and quite lovely. It\'s sophisticated and has a sweetness to it but the vanilla and almond are not cloyingly sweet in this, a light spray will provide a beautiful, very long lasting scent, overspray at your peril, you have been warned! :)', 'The oil version is the perfect version of the perfume spray it is rounded and lacks an odd note that bothers me on my skin.  A cheaper version is Abdul kareems baby powder perfume oil. For me the oil version of teint De neige is a winner!', 'As an avid powdery perfumes lover, I couldn\'t wait to sniff this one. Finally on my trip to Italy I saw this gem. And oh my goodness, it is divine. When you first spray it, it smells exactly like L\'Erbolario Iris, but the drydown is what makes these two perfumes different. With Iris it\'s very sweet and vanilla like, while with this one is that old school, classy and sophisticated powder/make-up smell. Gorgeous! The staying power is amazing. I also sprayed my scarf and even now, a week later, I can still smell it on. Perfect perfume that went straight to my ""want"" list.', ""I love this fragrance in the winter, it is sweet, powdery, marsh-mallowy and delicious. It is however, despite those words not for the faint-hearted. It is bold and brash with a definite vintage vibe. There are dominant notes of powdered florals like heliotrope, and the vanilla/tonka and musk underscore the whole perfume. Edit: After wearing and loving this for years, I've recently felt I can't wear it anymore because every time I do someone mentions that they can smell baby's nappies. Maybe they have changed nappies in recent years to make them smell like this because in the past I got nothing but compliments on this fragrance."", ""I imagine that Snow White would smell like this. It's pure like the first snow in the winter, powdery, delicate, lady-like. It does remind me of the scent of baby powder but not in a cheap but a nostalgic way.

I always get compliments when I use this.', 'The scent of classic white Dove soap mixed with heliotrope and heavy powder notes. So soft, sweet, and clean. Jivago Sweet Dreams is an exact dupe to my nose, except I prefer it over TdN for its better sillage.', ""I sprayed this on my left hand and Montale Powder Flowers on the right hand. Teint de Neige is great, powerfull. I think it's better than Powder Flowers. TdN smells like delicious marzipan and is fresher, greener than PF. PF smells sweeter, like cheap Amaretto."", 'This had been on my wishlist for over a year. Then someone sent me a sample of Jivago Sweet Dreams. Wow. Talk about a dead ringer, and for a fraction of the cost. Before you buy TDN, at least sample Sweet Dreams. You could save yourself a whole lot of $$$.', ""Bought a rather expensive sample of this from Les Senteurs Believe me it was well worth it. I first sprayed this on a paper sampler – wow! A burst of creamy, peachy almost edible sweetness wrapped in a cloud of powdery spun sugar. To my surprise, half an hour later the top notes were still the only thing I could detect, but an hour or so later, I have violets cut with vanilla and a fragrance that takes me back to my childhood and scented cachou sweets - rather like what I imagine opening a drawer in Ava Gardener's dressing table would be like. Make no mistake though, as warm, rounded and in some ways innocent this dry down is, it's Ava and definitely not Audrey Hepburn. Adore it and can't wait to own a full size bottle."", 'I have it ! finally love this smell , I know this perfume over 5 years  and now I got bottle from my mother in law (her signature for over 10 years)  it is musk and talc powder', ""This perfume does not come near iris L'erbolario!! what's wrong with people???????? at the first sniff that i spray this perfume i smell musk! That does not exist in l'erbolario iris!! i have finished 6 bottles of l'erbolario so i know that perfume as good as my face routine. so i don't understand people comparing this to L'erbolario Iris. This smells verry the same as White Musk Tesori d`Oriente."", ""This really does smell like babies. It's slightly rosy and very powdery so it could also be a 'makeup' smell as some others have written. It goes on very strong and then settles down to a sugary rosy powder.  I get the hospital and chlorine smell in the beginning (like babies at the swimming pool) but give it time, only a short time, and it will be 'like angels dusting their wings' as some have said.  I too would consider wearing this on my wedding day."", 'A very feminine and fluffy powder explosion! The most authentic ""makeup"" smell that I have tried. It literally smells like my makeup bags used to smell back in the day when I carried my big Estée Lauder loose powder in it and of course it would spill everywhere. This smells like the real deal.  Teint de Neige smells very similar to the original Ombré Rose. The way it smelled back in the 80s before it was reformulated to death and made into a cheaper product (that sadly now smells of hairspray the first solid hour). I wore Ombre Rose for years back in the day and bought the new version recently and Teint de Neige actually smells more like the original Ombré Rose than the Ombré Rose of today. If you miss the original I believe you would be extremely happy with Teint de Neige. Classic retro powdery makeup smell. Teint de Neige is very potent. It packs a big powder punch! Just a couple of dabs and I felt like a powder sillage monster. Villoresi seems like a very quality product and at a very reasonable price by niche standards.', ""This is utterly beautiful and by far the best powder fragrance I have tried. The floral aspect makes it modern and fresh, with great longevity and decent sillage. There's a gentle sweetness in the background that draws you in... I can totally understand the rave reviews, all true and justified in my opinion. Teint de Neige is very alluring and sophisticated - I'm in love!"", 'Teint de Neige ,  What to say what hasn\'t been already said ? I agree with all the reviews on here , some are so good they gave me goosebumps ,,, ,,,""Ike Angels on cloud dusting their wings "" ,,,"",like an ice cream parlour in the 60 s"" ,,,""makeup and lipstick , little old ladies ,,,"", All that is exactly what Teint de Neige smells like.  It\'s a sweet , powdery, elegant and very femine perfume , it feels velvety and musky and soapy , it also smells of almonds and marzipan due to the heliotrope and the tonka. Big focus on Tonka here.  It\'s plush, it\'s pwdery and its soapy , smells of face powder and talc , but has a fluffy freshness to it , I asume the rose and the Jasmine is responsible for that. Although you cannot smell the flowers , but without them it would be dull  Teint de Neige also reminds me of Nivea cream , the ones that are in the tins right from Germany. Its a little different than the North ameraican Nivea cream . ,,,,, I just came across a review of Teint de Neige , so these aren\'t my words but it describes it perfectly , I wanted to share it ; ""It is powdery, and deliciously sweet, while at the same time being elegant and erotic. What Mr Villoresi did here is really sheer genius: I mean, how many fragrances do you know that smell sexy and elegant, and childlike and mature, and gourmand and sophisticated at the same time? Right, not very many. Teint de Neige does all of this, and it does it effortlessly."" Really well described in my opinion !', 'A must have for powdery lovers, too much like bvulgari petit et maman for my personal taste, and becoming too trendy at the moment.

It seems it can bother some people because it is so singular, but I can't deprive myself from such a comforting scent. It's baby powder, in an elegant and sophisticated way. It can't be compared to any other fragrance. This is one of a kind."", ""Masses of baby powder sprinkled in a hospital room smelling of antiseptic or a dettol-swabbed sweetshop. I normally love 'Powder' but this is just too much of a good thing."", 'I am quite new to reviewing and really don\'t feel up to the challenge of reviewing something like Teint de Neige. If you want to know how this fragrance smells, just scroll down and you will find some much better descriptions than mine. But don\'t give up on reading right now. I will be brief on the description and go straight to the point of my review: Teint de Neige is the mother of all powders. A beautiful blend of white flowers, musk and the biggest powder cloud this powder lover could ever find. Silage is big and lasting power even bigger. This can easily break the 12+ hours longevity mark and, depending how you apply, can still be noticed after a shower. Now, straight to the point: how to wear it. First of all, you probably don\'t need more than the EDT. This is strong, loud and tenacious. The matching body products are great to look at, but this fragrance really permeates everything. Apply the right amount and you will enjoy it in all its glory. But one extra spritz can ruin everything. You will find yourself trying to scrub it off and it won\'t be easy without a sandblaster. I usually ""pool"" my fragrances, but found out the hard way that this is not good with TdN. If you are used to the ""spray and walk through"" method, try it with this one. Decanting and dabbing is also a great option. But if you don\'t want too much work, be careful. The spraying mechanism is tricky. Both my bottles have very hard to push down sprayers, so there is no chance of ""tiny spritzes"". I usually do one spritz on the back of my neck (from distance) and one on my left forearm (I\'m right handed) which I immediately press together with the right forearm. That\'s all. A third spritz would make me taste it all day and regret my perfume choice.', 'Well, it\'s been a long while since I\'ve written a review. But I felt the need to say that tonight I received the most fascinating feedback on this (or any!) perfume.  My fiance walked in and said, ""it smells like powder in here."" I said, ""that\'s me, \'Teint De Neige\' perfume."" Then he said, ""it reminds me of Legolas."" I stared at him in bewilderment. LEGOLAS! From Lord of The Rings! You know what? I get it. The cold, flawless beauty of Orlando Bloom with his long blonde ""Legolas"" locks. The ""frozen in time"" immortal quality of the Elves as they glide through their forests thick with branches like icicles. King Thranduil\'s ""white jewels of pure starlight"", Galadriel\'s ""light of of Earendil, our most beloved star."" Speaking of immortality, powder is a scent texture that reminds us of aged women and of newborn babies, simultaneously. It\'s a scent texture that reminds us of makeup, which we use to essentially ""freeze"" our face in a moment of (more) youthful beauty, or to ""ice"" the surface our skin. Remember, too, that magic powders have long been supposed to grant us immortality or prolonged youth. Teint De Neige is not a scent that I find particularly beautiful in itself, but it evokes timelessness, and sometimes a perfume that works magic is even better than one that\'s only beautiful.', ""When I first tried this, I was a little overwhelmed. I can't explain what happened between then and now but I can say that this is a new love for me. I've discovered that I definintely go through phases with understanding perfumes and in the beginning the powder in this was overwhelming. Now, having become accustomed to makeup scents, I feel this fits into that category quite nicely, but obviously less on the iris side and more on the powder side. This isn't the lipstick vibe but the powder vibe, in a big way. But it's not just powder, the dry down is soft and rich. I'll call this a comfort scent and say that I NEED to find a bottle. If anyone is looking to trade, let me know!"", ""I love Teint de Neige; it's obviously for powder lovers only, as the wonderful name suggests, but if you are I'm not sure you can do much better than this. This is a fragrance like an expensive cashmere sweater: very feminine, mature and elegant, but also very warm and comforting. It's all powder, longlasting, very rich and a bit boozy at first; just like that sweater I think it would get uncomfortable fast in the warmer seasons, but when it's cold it feels just perfect. Although they're not listed, I'd swear there were almonds involved as well, because it immediately reminded me of a more sophisticated, less edible version of those loukhoum type perfumes that I like so much. I think it's suitable for just about any occasion for an adult woman, from business over maternal settings (as someone else has mentioned) to seduction. There's definitely no danger of feeling slightly uneasy with this one, like I've raided the closet of a teen girl with a sweet tooth, as I do with some of my other comforting winter favourites. So I've really fallen in love, and now I'm not so sure what I'm going to spend the disposable part of my christmas bonus on after all; I had a plan, but I don't think I can face the rest of this winter without Teint de Neige anymore..."", 'The only thing i got from this fragrance was an overwhelming ""johnson baby powder"" scent. Excellent longevity, a delicate, soft fragrance, but it is very linear on me, and too powdery.', ""First, let me say I am a lover of powdery fragrances--take a look at my wardrobe and loves, and you'll see. I didn't think I had any limitations when it came to powder--until I met Teint de Neige. This is just TOO powdery. Wearing it feels like I'm being assaulted by powder--going up your nose, going down your throat, choking you--and I'm not sure what note(s) are causing it, but there's a weird chemically aroma that comes along with it. Nope, this is not a winner in my book."", 'Extremely good quality, but toooo powdery...Sorry it is not on my taste, feminine but no sensual and seductive, it smells like an elegant oooold woman.

Make sure you get samples before commiting to full size since this one is expensive.', ""Teint de Neige opens with a blast of an utterly extraordinary chemical note like floury chlorine, but very quickly settles into powder, powder and more powder – it's what you might call linear. Usually I find the powder is gently floral (heliotrope-rose-jasmine) and sweetly vanillic, somewhere between baby talc and the retro foundation TdN is named for, that keeps me sniffing my wrist. However, occasionally I notice a dry, papery note as if I'm sniffing a tissue with the fragrance sprayed on it, rather than perfumed skin. At the same time the fragrance seems cloying, with the initial chlorine explosion taking too long to transmogrify into something more appealing. When I get this effect it makes me wonder what I saw in Teint de Neige and why on earth I bought it, so it stays in Purgatory for quite some while. Then it calls me to wear again, and sometimes I love it to pieces and wonder why it's so long since I wore it, sometimes I don't. It's something of a shapeshifter for me as you can probably tell, and after puzzling over my varying reactions I have come to the conclusion that, rather counter-intuitively, TdN works better for me in milder weather than in the cold. I suspect this is because the sweeter elements that keep the powder-bomb in check can blossom more easily when it's warmer. Even so, if you are after a hardcore powder scent then Teint de Neige is it. Many others come close, including Montale's Powder Flowers, for example – but they just tickle you a bit with their powder-puffs. Teint de Neige smacks you in the face, and keeps doing it for ten or so hours. Good, clean, sado-masochistic fun."", ""Last time I tested this I had completely different impression - oversized baby powder.  This time (and a hundred and something of other fragrances later) this is something else - powder for grown-ups; bitter, powdery, a lot of iris, rose and musk.

A big thumb up.', ""reminds me of old beauty products' smell. Not much else. Bit of sharpness in the middle. Really unimpressive. Not floral."", ""An explosion of powder, with an odd combination of sweetness and bitterness, sort of the way you would experience an actual giant poof cloud of powder in your bathroom: the scent would be sweet, but there is a bitter quality to breathing air that is saturated with particles. I suppose that's because some of them end up on your tongue, where they undoubtedly do taste bitter. One odd feature of Teint de Neige: from the vial, or sprayed on inorganic substrates like porcelain, it does possess a divine cool freshness. I had such high hopes for this scent after sniffing the vial! But on skin or even paper, it loses that touch of balance that would make it so powerfully beautiful. I have heard Teint de Neige compared to Chanel No. 22. These are worlds apart, but they do share a kind of overpowering buzz/fizz. The difference, for me, is that No. 22 matches that aura, at every step, with the deeper, weightier, more reflective notes of frankincense and tuberose."", 'I so love this perfume.

Not sure if it would work in wamm weather.', 'This review is for the EDP. This has to be the sweetest perfume I have ever smelled!  It\'s insane!  In my opinion the sugar should be way up there together with the powdery notes in the main notes figure. In my opinion the most prominent notes are: Powder, sugar, heliotrope, rose and musk.  Sweet, sweet, sweet, powder bomb!  It\'s like a huge powder puff inside a giant sack of refined white sugar. I can seriously feel the sugar granules on my tongue as I smell it! This does absolutely NOT smell like perfume in the literal sense. It\'s way too abstract! interesting, that\'s for sure. Smells like the inside of an old makeup bag filled to the brim with sugar, seriously! And you know what? I LOVE it! It\'s ""THAT"" close to being too much to handle, but it just works for me.  I can definitively see it as being too powerful in the wrong way for those who don\'t like it though!  A real love it or hate it scent. It\'s very powerful in silage. Two sprays would be the absolute maximum for me, more than that and I think I might just faint! And in hot summer weather? I don\'t think so.. perfect cold weather/winter frag!  Very long lasting too, at least you\'d get your moneys worth!  The only floral notes I can sense ever so slightly is a hint of rose and a bit of heliotrope. They are definitively there, however they seem to be drowning in all the powder/sugar!  Teint de Neige has the EXACT smell of a ""traditional"" face powder, only it\'s ten times sweeter!  It reminds me a bit of N22 by Chanel, only the fresh, sparkly notes in that one is absent here, and instead the sweetness and powder is amplified a thousand times!  If you love sweet and powdery smells, chances are you\'ll adore Teint de Neige. On the other hand, if you hate them you\'ll very probably hate this perfume too. As simple as that. Don\'t go thinking of this as a heliotrope or rose fragrance! No, no, no! this is a powder and sugar fragrance all the way! In some ways it makes me think of baby powder or baby oil/lotion it does have that slight ""oiliness"" to it, but mostly it\'s VERY dry. However, because it is so very powerful, it feels more like an ""adult"" sort of powder to me.  It\'s very suggestive, erotic even. I would never have imagined anything like that just by looking at the notes!  Oh! It also smells like that vanilla/plastic like smell of certain toys and doll heads that I remember from when I was a kid, which makes it kind of nostalgic too!

I can not separate notes of flowers – all I feel is powder, musk, heliotrope…The longevity is extremely good – it last’s all day.

Warm, comforting, luxurious powder is what I get from it. At first spritz I get the floral notes and the musk, and then it dries down to pure creamy powder. I applied it with great caution as others described it as overpowering and a ""sillage monster"", but on me it was actually quite subtle and delicate. It is a very inviting scent...warm, cosy, familiar..like meeting someone for the first time and yet feeling like you\'ve known them for years. I adore it.', ""I thought that Teint de Neige is a sweet perfume, but it is not sweet at all. I have tried the EdT version, and it is no less soapy than it is powdery. It smells like some good old times soap bar, not in a bad way, though. I felt like I opened a closet full of clean vintage dresses, with old unopened soap bars between the clothes. And boy, is it ever strong! And it's an eau de toilette!  The scent itself is very linear, just clean heady powder with, as I said, soapy undertones. Absolutely not floral, I don't get any real heliotrope or rose smells. Very good quality, amazing longevity, but as for me, I would not buy it, as much as I am into powdery fragrances. Teint de Neige lacks warmth and personality for me, and has a little bit dated feel, which I usually do not appreciate.  If you are looking for a strong, clean powdery/soapy fragrance, this is probably for you, but test it before purchasing!"", ""Teilani, by teint de neige Villoresi describes the pale colour of ladies 'skin when they wear face powder (at least in the 40's and 50's face powders were light in colour).So nothing to do with snow, but TDN can only be appreciated by someone who loves top quality powdery scents because it's very poudrè indeed! By the way I don't think a man can pull this one off nicely as TDN is way too feminine,"", 'To echo ninaboo, ""Holy Macaroni. This is probably the most mature baby powder you will ever smell."" Yes. And if that sounds the slightest bit appealing to you, this is probably a fantastic scent. To those who endorse the echos of snow this is named for? Huh? I am born, raised, and have chosen to continue to live in the Canadian north. I like to think myself familiar with many iterations of snow. Despite this, I\'m sorry, I really don\'t get it. Perhaps I am too literal, but really, no. This is powder on steroids. I got the vaguest hints of other notes, but after 2.5 hours of not enjoying this, I went and took a soak to, among other things, wash this away. It\'s just too much for my sensibilities.', ""Musk perfumes generally come in two broad versions: skanky sweaty, verging on body fluids scents; and clean and fresh as a baby's bottom scents. Lorenzo Villoresi TEINT DE NEIGE clearly falls into the latter category. I dislike sweaty musk but appreciate this clean presentation. I do not believe that it is original, but it smells perfectly nice. I am reminded of all sorts of white musk fragrances with a fresh sweetness, including Gandini MUSCHIO BLU, Comptoir Sud Pacifique CRISTAL DE MUSC, and Laurence Dumont MUSC BLANC. No surprise, since all of these sorts of perfumes combine sweet notes such as heliotrope and tonka with a substantial clean musk base.  The flowers in TEINT DE NEIGE are not really discernible individually to my nose, but judging by the comparisons made by reviewers to nearly every perfume under the sun, it seems that the dominant musk is more dominant on some wearers (such as me) than on others. I would never compare this scent to Montale POWDER FLOWERS, for example, and I do not find it to be overly powdery. To me, this is the scent of clean musk, not the baby powder accord of Kenzo FLOWER. I like it! Freshly bathed, slightly sweet baby skin smells good to--and on--me!"", ""This one isn't for everyone. Smells different on defferent people. Very powdry, fresh and clean smell.

I will apply slightly more tomorrow until I find the perfect amount for my chemistry. Ordered a bottle as soon as I put it on.

It smelled heavenly from the moment I opened the package. It started off as sweet powder, which was lovely but now it is changing into something even more beautiful. It has become a Symphony of many scents..rose...heliotrope ....and sweet jasmine. Because I read other reviews about its strength I applied it very lightly to my chest and then dabbed every so slightly to my pulse points on my wrists. This IS powdery on me but it is also lightness as well. It reminds me of serenity.... Innocence... The essence of femininity. Slight musk makes an appearance but is happy to share its space with all the other members of this wonderful Orchestra!!! I am 57..a triathlete..a gardener...and many other things. And I love this scent..it captures my very Essence....', 'I like it BUT can anybody give me advice how to wear without overpowering because one sprits is already to much. How do you apply this sillage monster ?', ""Holy Macaroni. This is probably the most mature baby powder you will ever smell. However, it also manages at the same time to smell elegant.

In fact, Soavissima smells exactly like this perfume with a slight difference -- this one is a little bit older than Soavissima. So, Soavissima is a good copy of this beautiful perfume.

Or people might ask me why I doused myself with baby powder. Because that's really what this smells like--a $2 bottle of baby powder. So would I pay $100+ for it? I can't make up my mind. I might just start with a decant. Update: I bought a decant. Death by Baby Powder should be the name of this, for I felt smothered by it.

Proceed at your own risk. ;) \u2028I happened upon it some years ago, by accident. Picture this: one cool sunny winter late morning in Rome, the air is crisp but the sun has a touch of warmth, we're close to Christmas so decorations and lights are on and the atmosphere is festive. I was walking on a street full of shops when I suddenly marched into an old, slightly upscale, and very well-known perfume shop, went to one of the sales assistant with a request: I told him that I recently tried Prada Infusion d’Iris, liked the cleanliness and soapiness of the scent, but was very let down by the appallingly poor staying power (especially when compared to the price). Would he be able to recommend a similar perfume that wouldn’t be gone after an hour? He asked me a few questions, I mentioned, incidentally, that I tried and liked a lot Bas de Soie by Lutens in the recent past but that was not quite what I had in mind. If by this time you’re thinking how on earth can you go from Infusion d’Iris to Teint de Neige that have almost nothing in common but the iris note I would agree, but bear with me. I cannot praise enough how the sales assistant read me and listened to me, because he not only took in my appearance - brunette, mid-20s, red lipstick, cat eye, minimalist dark clothes, red wool coat - but also saw deeper than that. I have some friends that jokingly call me Diva, which I am anything but by the way, it’s just I am a little aloof when you first meet me but then I warm up. Anyway, he anticipated my needs and introduced me to something I didn’t know I liked myself: powder. I mean, I knew and I even loved the smell of talc powder, ten years before as a teenager I had briefly been obsessed with Bvlgari Petits and Mamans, what I mean is that I was not aware of my love for powdery scents on a conscious level. He said after a while that since I said no to Bas de Soie, which was one of his first choices for me (he definitely picked on the aloofness there), he was going to go on another route. We talked a little and eventually reduced the samples to three: Lutens Daim Blond, Teint de Neige and a third scent that for the life of me I can’t remember. After smelling them on the strips I discarded the forgotten third and spritzed the other two on the skin. At first I liked them both but almost immediately got the apricot in Lutens and I’m not really a fan of fruity perfumes, so that was more and more a no every minute that went by. On the other hand, with Teint de Neige, in addition to being love at first sniff, the infatuation grew with the passing of time. I didn’t buy it that day, the very competent shop assistant advised that I spend the day with it and see how it evolved on my skin. Not only it evolved beautifully, I could still smell it the next day after a shower. I went back a week later and got a bottle. Now it’s become my signature, I wear it almost every day, in winter and also in summer because I don’t believe in the seasonality of scents (sorry not sorry for the people around me), and although I refrain to perfume during daytime in summer it’s not really out of concern for the others, just for fear of the perfume reacting with the light. I am vain and selfish like that! ;) \u2028Sillage and staying power, for me, are huge to the point that the more aware people recognise me by it, like I went to a party at a friend’s house and the hostess, that knows me quite well but didn’t know I had arrived, asked from another room if I was there only because she recognised the trail of perfume in the house. Christmas time a couple of years ago I went back to see my parents and at night, when my mother hugged me at the airport said she missed my perfume (as well as me lol) which I applied in the morning, and then she said she smelled it again the next morning when I walked in the kitchen for breakfast. A lot of people commented on it when I enter a shop or on a train carriage. In conclusion, this perfume now it’s become me, I inhabit it, it’s a million things to me, like lace lingerie under a comfy cashmere jumper, it’s old and new, a silk vintage dress worn with a leather biker jacket. I’m not saying it’s a complex perfume, or a revolutionary concept, I think I feel this way because I identify with it so much by now. And even if I know it’s ridiculous I feel like it’s mine and mine only, also because I’ve never walked past anyone else who wore it. I think I also like it so much because it compensates my aloofness, as if with its powdery sweetness told other people that I’m not the Ice Queen that I might seem at first. Ultimately I think that was my unconscious reason for writing off Bas de Soie from the start, that’s one perfume I like a lot but probably fear it would play too much into my perceived standoffishness. One last thing: yes it’s true, Iris by L’erbolario, which I would have loved to love since Villoresi is not really in my price range, is almost the exact copy, albeit much flatter, but compared side by side with Teint de Neige smells so cheap and chemical and plasticky it literally hurts. Back when I still lived in Italy it was not unusual to walk past women doused in the knockoff, it was very popular for a while but, dear oh dear, the headaches that I got smelling that!"", ""OMG. Don't buy the EDP version if you care for your life. Johnson & Johnson baby powder x 20,000  Extreme powder scent. It suffocates everything and clings to skin, clothes, metal & plastic.

Honestly wouldn’t pay Diptyque price for this one as I feel like it could be easily found in a cheaper body spray from the Body Shop or something.  I got a travel size in a travel kit and it’s almost like a “cute” citrus - inoffensive, fizzy, clean, nondescript.  I find it has the worst staying power out of any Diptyque fragrances I own, I can only smell it for maybe 1-2 hours.  I do like it as a gym scent as it’s clean and crisp, but once I go through the travel size I won’t be buying a full bottle. Diptyque has WAY better fragrances than this one.', ""I think all the reviews for Oyedo is spot on, so I won't give my full review. I'm not sure where the fizzy nature of the scent is coming from, i'm assuming it's from the Yuzu. This is the first time I've smelled Yuzu in a fragrance. It just feels like an abrasive citrus, kind of like neroli or orange blossom, but much more harsh. It also smells very synthetic, almost like a fragrance found in a chemical cleaning solution. It's good for standing out but i think the abrasive nature makes it difficult for most people to make a good impression on someone. I don't find the scent particularly attractive overall either as it looks like the perfumer is really featuring and pushing the Yuzu and not much else. I'm not really sure why someone would go for this when there are so many other beautiful citruses available on the market. I'd rate Oyedo a 4.0/10. I think Diptyque makes some really nice fragrances, but this is not one of them."", 'smells like citrusy toothpaste.

Oyedo is very refreshing and delightful.', 'I’m just baffled by all the negative reviews of this gorgeous, herby, zingy, fizzy, elegant and uplifting gem. I also don’t think I’m picking up the same notes most reviews mention.  I can’t pick up the frambinone, so that might be a molecular I’m anosmic to. I also don’t get anything sweet or candy-like. All I smell are the fizzy yuzu (if you’ve never eaten it, you should, especially with sushi) and tonic, aromatic thyme with maybe cedarwood anchoring it. Lemon and thyme are a classic culinary pairing and, again, I definitely recommend eating or drinking it. Thyme in lemonade is just delicious. I also get a bit of juicy mandarin here and there, and lemon juice, not rind, holding everything together.  So, yeah, if we’re staying with the edible associations, this reads to me more like a savory gourmand than a cough drop. At the end of the day I find this sophisticated and dazzling.  If you really hate your bottle, feel free to send it my way because this is a hot, dry summer daytime ride-or-die for me.', 'I have a lot of Diptyque perfumes and this is one of the worst.

Oyedo does not belong to the top tier of Diptyque’s most original creations, but it is still quite nice and memorable - at least it appeals to us who enjoy fresh and aromatic scents. Allow me to sum up this fragrance in one sentence: the opening is yellow, and the drydown is green! In other words, it progresses from sparkling citric notes to herbal, woody and tea-like notes towards the end of its development on the skin.', 'trust the reviews for this one! the opening is really sweet. but the dry down, for me, ended up very soft and herbal with a hint of smooth citrus. i absolutely love this. not blind buy friendly!!!', ""Oyedo opens as an airy dance of citrus, grapefruit and lemon in a gentle duet, bright yet never cutting. A crisp hint of herbaceousness, perhaps a dash of thymol for that wild, garden-fresh edge, flits in to lend this cool, unexpected twist. And then—if my nose serves me right—a soapy trace of orange blossom emerges, sweet and delicate, though unlisted. I wonder if it’s just the layers, bending and swirling? But as it dries, balance does slip slightly; the airy vibrancy gives way to a sugary, menthol-like haze, almost like sussing out that candy glaze from a sweet tooth's minty breath. It’s a curious journey—from sparkling brightness to an intriguing, slightly jarring inish. Complex yet so very simple, unpredictable and so undeniably playful."", 'Initial spray is a super lovely, fresh, zestly orange. The drydown however did not convince me fully.

I\'ll have to try wearing it to know if I still love it.', 'This has a cooling effect on my skin. I am not sure if it is thyme/camphor/mint. But it feels nice. In japan, you get humid /sunny days and theres this water mist that you spray on your skin to help cool down your body. This has the same effect on my skin. It smells really refreshing, too.', ""An exercise in minimal aesthetics, beautifully constructed out of woody herbs and citrus. The best part comes a little into further into the dry down where cool, shaded tones of aromatic pines and running water come together. The yuzu fades a bit, but every note seems to share a set of terpenic-citrus compounds that overlap and complement each other nicely. Bracingly fresh camphor and menthol-like aromas feel like crushed herbs beneath your fingers. It's wide-open and spacious in a way that feels like standing in a garden on the verge of life in early spring. Nothing in bloom, but the trees stand covered in morning dew as life begins to a re-emerge.  There are a good number of phenolic components in thyme essential oil, and the effect here feels like just a tad bit of smoke, or maybe the phantom of a tarry leather note. Given the context of the marketing and the Japanese perfumer, it feels reflective of a temple deep in the forest, surrounded by trees with the remnants of the day’s incense lingering in the air. All that time a faint raspberry aroma sits in the background, lending a juicy-fruity dimension to the citrus.  For some negatives- its simplicity within the “pine” genre sits a bit too close to some scented candles. I've also found since I bought a bottle that it does have a candied orange aroma that I don't love and I wished the fruity raspberry/sweet syrup aroma was toned down."", 'I quite like it. Perhaps love it. Bought a full bottle. It’s a clean woody citrus with a green touch. Does have a Japanese feel.', ""I really wanted to love this perfume, because yuzu is a favourite flavour of mine. But the reviews were right-- this smells like a dose of sugar and citrus, if that's what you're into. A candied scent, if you will. Too sweet for me."", ""The strong authentic lemony opening is great. From there, its like a mildly spicy yuzu orange musk with a floral accent. It's okay, but really sinks from the opening quality and zest imo. Definitely smells like medicinal candy. Bottle the opening!"", 'Smells just like tangerine Altoids sours.', ""I was gifted this by a lovely friend. With this perfume, you're hit by the candied lemon and mandarin at first. Then there's a raspberry thyme note that follows as it settles. I found this to be too sweet for me, almost sugary when it was dried down. I didn't realise this contained yuzu as it was hard to detect...(definitely needed more yuzu). The thyme was actually my favourite part of this perfume. I can see why people would think this lends towards a cough-drop sort of smell because of it. I wished for it to be a bit more complex; green or tea notes would probably compliment this profile really well. Also I didn't expect much in terms of longetivity as it's an EDT but man is it short lived! Only lasts 1-2 hours on my skin. On clothes it lingers for a tad bit more. It's not a bad perfume by any means but a bit basic for my taste !"", 'I quite enjoy this little aromatic freshie. It’s fizzy and citrusy, it’s definitely aromatically green with that fresh almost grassy thyme. Some people have described this as very sweet. I really don’t find any Diptyque fragrance “sweet.” It might have a natural sweetness from the orange but that’s it. Perhaps they mean this is sweet compared to other fragrances from Diptyque. Above all Diptyque is always natural which this definitely is that. If you enjoy this and want a scent in the same style you might try Eau de Jour by Veronique Gabai.', 'Whyyyyy does this smell like a menthol cough drop. I was so excited for the yuzu notes and the green elements of this perfume. It dries down better and the menthol scent fades, but the perfume lacks the complexity I was hoping for.

Ha una durata molto breve."", ""Exactly the same scent of Muji's essential oil called 'Yuzu' :)))) I love it, it is lightly citrusy, zesty, calming, and a bit cozy but not too sharp like orange/lemon/lime"", ""This is an absolutely GORGEOUS scent, like fizzy lemonade and super refreshing on a hot day. It has the feel of mint or menthol as you apply to your skin, it's cooling and pleasant. I will always want a bottle of this in my collection and it's one of the best lemon freshies out there. Nothing too sweet or cloying about this. I find it pairs well with a little spritz of Guerlain's Bergamote Fantastico from the A&M Extrait line, it makes it last a lot longer. I also wish it lasted longer, but this is an EDT, and a freshie, so understandable it's short lived as those top notes are so volatile. There's an advantage to that though - because you can have this as a morning scent, then switch up to something else by the afternoon. Super long lasting isn't always what's required, if what you fancy is a change."", ""this is fine i suppose, a pretty light and refreshing orange scent. i am satisfied with my sample for now, i don't think i would buy a full bottle of this."", ""Its a straight forward and well done mandarin note. Smelling it really do remind me of eating a fresh mandarin at the Asian farmer's market. It's the first bottle I ever bought from Diptyque when I was in early my 20's and wanted to find a perfume with a realistic orange notes that wasn't too gourmand. Kinda sad that it doesn't last long on me and the scent isnt strong.  Now that I'm almost 30, I'm starting to think this scent is too young for me but I find that it's actually really good for layering with my other perfumes that might be too spicy/smoky by adding a bright/sweetness to them so it's more versatile than I originally thought. Probably won't rebuy because of the longevity but definitely plan to finish and not rehoming like I usually do with scents I find I phased out."", ""Straight up smells like lemon-menthol cough drops, but I'm not mad about it! I don't know that I'll ever need a full bottle, but I'm happy I snagged a travel size for a fantastic price :) This is citrussy, fresh and herbal, and fantastic for summer.  For me it barely resembles Sundazed though. This is citrus & mint/herbs, Sundazed is neroli & cotton candy. I can kind of understand how some might see a lot of similarity between the two but I think if, like me, citrus freshies are what you're most commonly drawn towards you'll also be puzzled by the comparisons. I personally love Sundazed more because I'm an absolute sucker for neroli, but Oyedo also has things going for it--to me it's less intense (by which I don't mean weaker, but less likely to cause a headache) and also unisex, whereas Sundazed is quite loud and feminine-leaning (not a bad thing, just trying to paint a picture for anyone trying to decide between the two). If you're a citrus enthusiast I'd say go ahead and order samples of both TBH as they're quite different!"", ""Oyedo is the grown-up version on Byredo's Sundazed. Less sweet and slightly more sophisticated, yet incredibly similar. There's that same tangy stickiness that reminds me of a childhood summer day with a popsicle melting on your fingers. Only now more time has passed and the memory has lost some of its vividness. Fresh fruity splash of citrus on a subtly sweet and herby base. Perfectly unisex."", ""I have a small version of this in my handbag, it is the perfect hit of citrus for me when I'm on the go. To me its a balance of grapefruit and herbs, a lovely scent but it does not last long at all.

From the moment I first tried it, I felt an immediate connection. The scent lingers, lasting well beyond the hours I’d expect, and it feels as if it’s become a part of my daily rhythm. There’s a certain meditative quality to Oyedo that resonates deeply with me. The citrus notes are bright yet soothing, striking a balance that mirrors the calm energy I aim for in my yoga and meditation practices. It’s not overpowering, but it’s there, like a gentle reminder to breathe and stay present. What I love most is how it aligns with my lifestyle. Whether I’m moving through the day’s demands or finding stillness on my mat, Oyedo feels right. It’s attractive, yes, but it’s also grounding, creating a sense of calm that I carry with me.', ""Love this one, but it doesn't last super long.

It is such a fun, grapefruit-raspberry gummy bear in the beginning! Fizzy, bright, fresh. But the “thyme” note that develops is just so strange to me. I can’t place what it becomes on my skin— it’s not camphorous, it’s not particularly herbal. It doesn’t smell like any fresh herb I’ve ever grown or touched. Nevertheless, each time I try it, I’m hoping my nose has evolved and this thyme note won’t disturb me. As of today, it sadly still does.', ""Sniffed it at ZGO years ago, loved the refreshing nature since it was so hot in SF at the time, so I came back and bought it on the spot. Well, fast forward to after a few wears and the mentholated thyme note is ever present, rather medicinal and true to it's herb - but jarring and poorly contrasted with the zingy, citric opening. And that opening, which once I loved during a heat wave, began to remind me of orange PEZ candy tablets or orange flavoured baby aspirin - citric, but dusty and fizzy ... and sort of chemical - that aspect became more pronounced the longer it macerated in the bottle. And boy did it last, too - a chemical caricature of yuzu with the skin-cooling, woody mentho-thyme became too much for me and I gifted it to someone who'd use it better. A unique, quirky perfume - very Diptyque - nothing like it out there."", '1/5', ""smells like recovering from a cold, obsessively dropping eucalyptus essential oil in your diffuser and rolling around lotte vita c candy in your mouth until your tongue feels pruned. no honey, thankfully! it does not last long but i think 4-5 sprays will decently project. i would say its ideal for someone who appreciates an aromatic citrus, but is prone to migraines or is irritated by certain notes like elemis or smoky properties. it's pleasant, the yuzu is distinctly yuzu so its not reminiscent of cleaning agent. not overly green like most fruity diptyques tend to lean, but the camphor/menthol quality of the thyme is prominent throughout, so this isn't for everyone."", ""Not sure how everyone else is getting all those citrus notes when they smell it. The thyme in this is so overpowering on me that it's putrid. This is absolutely not a safe blind buy. Shucks, it's not even a sighted buy if ya ask me.

I've been wearing it for 12 hours now (reluctantly) hoping it would improve. No luck, it has gotten a little bit sweeter but too big of a sniff and that thyme note comes back to haunt me. I feel violated 😂"", 'Smells exactly like sweet orange cough drops that literally made me sneeze. The menthol accord is strong, almost minty.

On me, it doesn't dry down to smell like candy but rather like I ran through a raspberry and citrus grove. I think the thyme note grounds the scent and adds an interesting herbal quality that supplies an intrigue and maturity."", ""First impression: This is fresh citrus after heavy rainfall. It's almost like if you went out into the lemon groves right after the heavy rain subsides."", ""This is such a happy scent! I have a 7,5ml spray bottle and I especially love it for days when I'm working from home or need to clean up the house and I'm feeling a bit sluggish. It immediately lifts my mood with the mouthwatering citrus opening. I also enjoy the aromatic touch. Like others have said, it has a cooling minty feel to it as well. It's by no means a dupe, but it Oyedo gives off the same energy as Byredo Bal d'Afrique, which is my boyfriend's signature. Simply put: great vibes!"", ""The opening of this is fresh orange, like you've taken one and torn it open, smells like the rind and all. I get a sort of metholated aspect to it but it's more like a cold, crisp air feel than veering into NyQuil territory.  During the dry down, to me, the orange balances out and I get a mineral/aquatic scent from this. It doesn't smell particularly sweet to me, Sundazed smells a lot more like Pez than this does. It reminds me of when I would go on hikes with my parents when I was younger, and it had been raining and we would stop by a lake. It smells like the wet rocks and plants and the water, but you've brought oranges with you. More than anything to me, this smells like rain. Like the static after a storm and the smell of rain on the dirt, this is the most close scent to petrichor I've found. Very crisp and refreshing"", ""Reading mixed reviews about it, but exactly not sure that should I purchase it or not.

It's definitely not the usual fresh citrus, by Diptique I much prefer the eau de tarocco, a fresh citrus, sweet and light in terms of purity not duration, regarding this perfume however I can say that it is certainly more acidic... that's it. .. it's really sour. I can't think of any other more appropriate adjective than this, there's something that squeaks, which makes it acidic, not in a negative sense but not even in a good way, I don't know, I've tried many hespereidates/citrus fruits in my life and I've usually liked them all because they generally have a fresh, vitaminic, sparkling, invigorating aura... which unfortunately I can't find in this perfume. It seems more like a fruity acidity than a fresh citrus described... too bad! Diptique has better ones."", ""I love citrus, and love the smell after it wears off a bit.

And Yuzu is a citrus fruit of East Asia and Japan. I always like fragrances with the Yuzu note, like Note the Yuzu by Heeley or Pour Homme Issey Miyake. It\'s a very fizzy, uplifting, and happy type of fruit. Unlike many reviewers who said there is no sweet or no sugar content, I actually get sweet, ""candy"" notes on it. This one is a unique citrus fragrance because citrus is combined with candy-sweet notes. Because of the candy sweet note, this could be a citrus option for cooler monthes of the year. Longevity is weak and I personally don\'t like the drydown of this one. My expectation from Diptyque is very high and it\'s one of my favorite houses.

I love perfumes like this, that are a bit bizarre but also quiet & do not demand attention.', 'This is my second ""orange smell liked\' fragrance in my pocket. I remember when I first tasting it in Diptyque store, I was not really into it. But after I fall into Eau Des Sens, I wonder to try Oyedo, wanna know how it is.  Second trial and after the third trial.... and the last trial was in winter time - the Chinese Lunar New Year, I noticed that this fragrance is not design for cold weather, still the smell makes me unforgettable, feel like very fresh and oriental-like, and really like that Chinese Chenpi (tangerine peel), just very fresh and fruity. Great to have it during summer time, you will feel the freshness and coolness right after you have sprayed on your skin. Love it.  Again, if you like fruity, fresh, and special, most important Japanese, Chinese or Oriental-liked, you can\'t miss it.  一支非常「東方感」的香水。這是我第二支柑橘及橙味為主調的Diptyque 香水。雖然這一支比感官之水更早面世，但我卻是經歷很多次體驗才決定買。東京柑橘之水我考慮了極長時間，因為我覺得自己已經有感官之水，相同的味調實在毋須要再擁有。經過多次試噴，包括在試紙、身上，又經歷過不是太想擁有去到很想擁有的階段..... 真的經歷很久，最後因為好奇心，買了。 東京柑橘之水很清新，雖然我最後一次的感覺停留在冬天，那是農曆大年初三，今次噴了試紙又噴在手臂上，感覺很持久，很清新，就像新年要有新氣象的感覺。那種陳皮/ 果皮的水果感覺，很特別。到最近才買、才試，是因為我有感官之水了，至今我終於能夠辨別起來，感官之水很「神」的感覺，橙花的基調較突出；而東京之水就是東方感和水果格調較突出，再者噴上皮膚後，在炎夏中你會感到即的清涼感，很舒服。', ""I absolutely love this! This is a sweet kind of citrus - one that I don't come across often - and again, it's spot on! I'm hesitant between Oyédo and Eau des Sens. Maybe I ought to get both. Oyédo is a sweeter interpretation of citrus, whilst Eau des Sens is a citrus/lemon bomb that pierces the nose (in a good and extremely refreshing way) similar to l'Eau d'Issey pour Homme. Here's what Diptyque says about Oyédo: 'An imperial fragrance. Oyédo: a name that signifies the spicy vivacity of the zest of yuzu, an Asian citrus fruit. At the heart of this eau de toilette, the full elegance of citrus emerges in an accord highlighted by raspberry and thyme. A perfume inspired by Japan's ancient imperial city, Edo.' And yes, I can smell the raspberry in there. Fragrantica is, again, missing an important note here. Raspberry is what differentiates Oyédo from Eau des Sens. This one is Mandarin Orange kind of sweet whilst the other has nothing sweet in it. I love both."", 'Bracing + fabulous.

The thyme gives it a rounded quality that unfortunately evaporates away on my skin, leaving a sweet candy citrus on my skin that I just don't appreciate. It is far, far, far from being synthetic, but it just doesn't agree with the silly mental image I have of myself and my smell. This would be fun on someone who loves the color yellow, lives in a happy, humid, bright climate with a go-lucky world view and incredible support group of friends and family. What I'm trying to say is this perfume is perfect for someone who cannot easily be upset because they have a good life. It's not a bad perfume; it's a perfect perfume for someone that could match how optimistic it is. It's too happy for me, and dare I say it even leans juvenile.

Another weird effect that Diptyque reminds you of is the smell of Raspberry, literally an effective, weird yet lovely vibe!', 'There is something so sweetly nostalgic in these opening notes. They are reminiscent of a hard candy I would eat as a child. It makes me feel like kid on this summery day. I agree with @fatter that this is more of a fruity gourmand than a citrus aromatic. I feel like this might give me a headache if worn directly under a hot sun, but in the shade now it is not cloying. I wouldn’t want to smell like this, but it is fun and uplifting to smell, as it takes me back to my childhood Edit: my partner says this smells like a cherry jolly rancher! Then he smelled it again and said it smells like Bengay 😂', 'Got this instead of L’eau des Hesperides which was out of stock. Really love this one. The variety of citrusy scents combined with the thyme made it feel minty to me and made me love it even more. The base wood notes is okay too. If you want more zest out of this beautiful perfume, try layering with By Kilian Lemon in Zest. Edit. A wonderful surprise, after 12hrs I can still sort of smell the mandarin making cameo appearances without having to bend down to sniff at my sleeves. That’s really a first for Diptyque EDT for me.', 'Instead of being categorized as a citrus aromatic, I would say fruity gourmand is far more fitting. Oyedo is a straight up orange flavored lollipop from the doctors office. A very jolly and sunny orange but unmistakably sweet and candy-like. No zest here. This omission of piquancy is the nail in the coffin for me not wanting to pursue any sort of speed dating with Oyedo. I need some acidic zip to counteract the sweetness. Otherwise it is like a can of flat coke. I have a feeling it would give me a terrible migraine.', 'You know the way that, as a child, random household objects somehow become your playthings? This was the case for me with a particular soapbox — which is to say, not a dramatic tirade, but a literal sturdy cardboard box that once contained a bar of soap. The box was the kind that slid out, with an elegant loop of orange ribbon to tug on to open it; it was a pale yellow, with an eclipse of an orange drawn on the side. I put beads and little animal figurines and tiny homemade dolls in there. I strung plastic beads on elastic and created a family of little toy beaded snakes, and they lived in the soap box. The thing I liked most about the box was the way it smelled. Even decades after holding any soap, the box holds a trace of effervescent citrus. It\'s a bright yellow-orange sort of smell, all bubbles and sunshine and laughter. Despite the orange on the side of the box, I recognize that lasting note now as yuzu. Looking back, I suspect that soap box shaped my early interest in fragrance. Oyedo reminds me of that box. I actually had a dream about the box a few days ago, and took it as a sign to review Oyedo. This is that same exact soapy, sunshiney yuzu in a vial. If you don\'t know what yuzu smells like, imagine the brightest, bubbliest imaginable citrus. It\'s clean, bright, and elevating, more than any orange, lemon, or lime. It\'s more yellow than a lemon, and lacks the sour tang. Instead, there\'s a crisp, uplifting brightness to it. The yuzu really shines in Oyedo, with the various other citrus notes supporting it and keeping that big yellow hot air balloon tied to earth. The earth in question is a field of thyme with a soapmaker\'s cottage in the middle. This is soapy like an incredibly high-quality bar of French-milled hand soap. It\'s very clean and bright, but not like something meant for laundry or cleaning a bathroom. It\'s a joyous bar of soap that makes you stop to sniff. The thyme provides a grounding herbal nuance that brings out the sweet contrast of the citrus. Nonetheless, I find that something about the thyme feels a bit odd and out of place as time goes on and the citrus fades away. Fellow anti-cilantro people, you know what I mean: a certain faint stink some herbs have, elusive to describe, that just doesn\'t feel quite correct. It\'s a little like the feeling of accidentally spilling pizza seasoning into your orange soda: something here doesn\'t belong. In a safe, sweet soap, something feels ambiguously grubby. Something in the herbal notes feels dense, heavy, and grounded the way coffee grounds do, with coarse texture that says ""this used to smell like something"". I might just be imagining it, or it might be my skin or my sample, but it feels a little off to me when I lose focus and Oyedo drifts under my nose. That discordance is subtle, though, and my experience of it is subjective. Overall, the thyme does lend pleasant depth to what would otherwise be a one-dimensional citrus scent. As it were, Oyedo is fairly linear, with the citruses bowing out and leaving a confused dash of thyme in their midst. In three hours, the scent is all but gone. This is too faint, too ephemeral, too linearly clean for my tastes, but I enjoyed the uplifting nature of the yuzu and the happy sensory memories it brings back. If you don\'t mind the weak projection, sillage, and longevity, and want a fresh, soapy citrus that makes you smile, give Oyedo a try.', ""The yuzu is fruity and juicy and it actually smells good in summer. However, I would rather smell this in air than on my skin because I don't wanna be a walking yuzu."", 'Realistic hard candy orange sweet. Beautiful when layered with Tam Dao.', 'This thyme note smells very realistic, which is cool, but for me it quickly overpowers the freshness of all the citrus components and then turns this fragrance into something herbal and headache inducing. Too bad, since it smells great on paper!', 'Pixy Stix candy powder and woody powder from an expensive wood table that was freshly polished with lemon, then finely milled in a wood chopper. Powdery yet juicy in a contradicting way.', ""Very pretty and straightforward citrus with a fizzy soda-pop sort of feel. I could see this being someone's summer favorite. Longevity is fairly good for a citrus scent."", 'Grapefruit and mint. Loved its freshness and pungency.', 'Orange soda. Too sweet and nothing much.', 'To meit smelled like Nim2 German orange candies with some menthol undertone. Did not like it at all, also no longetivity whatsoever...', ""Received as a sample. Browsed the reviews and have nothing really new to add -- I get the candy sweetness of orange Pez rather than a true, juicy orange and after a few moments, it's followed by a strong gust of menthol. Any woodiness or thyme is buried is in that brisk hit: think the sinus-clearing properties of pines and firs. Herbal/woody citruses can really run a wide gamut from cleaning products/bug spray/cheap hand soap to beautiful spa/hot springs scents, but sadly this one falls squarely in the former camp."", 'Let me start off by saying that this plays really well with my own chemistry, but based on these reviews it seems that Oyedo does not play well with a lot of other people’s. That being said, I really like this. It smells so realistically of tangerine, it smells like I just opened one and got the juice all over my skin. It actually makes my mouth water. Projection is great, especially for a citrus scent. It is a simple scent though, so not FBW for me, but I am enjoying my sample. I may enjoy this even more in the summer, we will see.', ""This is a fizzy, sweetish, mandarin-with-a-bit-of-lemon scent that leaves you smiling even though you didn't mean to. It is not multiple layers of fragrance experience, but is a lot of fun to wear. Sillage was moderate as was longevity, which is a feat for citrus fragrances, so hats off to Diptyque. It's high-quality and a punctuation mark of a citrus EDT. This is sunshine in a bottle."", ""Sweet, sweet citrus. A bit detergent-y, like I left some orange peels to soak in laundry detergent. It would be a lovely smell for a household cleaning product, but not something I'd want to wear on my skin. I also get a sugary, candy note. Overall, not very complex."", ""You have to be a true and devoted citrus lover to enjoy Oyedo. It has the most fizzy, zesty, juicy, realistic citrus opening that I almost want to drink it! A bit of peppery sharpness to the nose in the opening, but I love that! When I spray it on myself, it's as if one person is spraying me down with fresh lemon spa water while another person squeezes fresh lemon halves close to my nose. It's as close to bathing in lemon as you can get (if you're into that - I am!) If you've ever juiced a lemon and those oils and juices wafted up to your nose and made your eyes roll back in your head, and wished you could bottle and wear that moment, THAT'S OYEDO. Although Diptyque products are not cheap, I think you get what you pay for because this one has really good longevity for a citrus frag, and probably the best longevity of all the citrus frags I've owned. I could still smell it on me HOURS later. Of course the top notes had faded, but the fragrance was still there and in good concentration. Unisex 100%."", ""The citrus is very artificial and this smells like lemon pledge or any sort of supermarket citrus-scented cleaner to me. Can't stand it."", 'Exactly like lemon bonbon candle. The smell itself is ok but I would not like to smell like that...', ""When I first sprayed this, all I could smell was sherbet fountains - the sweets, where you have the lemon sherbet in a tube, with a black liquorice stick to eat it with. That's exactly what Oyedo smelt like to me - sherbet and sweet, chewy black liquorice.  I like the smell, it's fun and fizzy and very nostalgic. Not sure it's how I want to smell, myself, though."", ""This stuff smells like a nice, faithful grapefruit with a delicate zing in the bottle, but once it hits the skin it smells like you hit the floor. At a sticky night club. With the vestiges of sugary cheap cocktails mingled with your sweat now. Every person that has smelled it on me says the same thing. It's like someone splashed a cheap Manhattan all over me, and its sticky sugary stink now trails me like the breath of an alcoholic after a night out. I haven't managed to figure out how to wear it, and since it was a gift I've been trying to a find a way to make it work."", 'Wow, so unique yet familiar! Some reviewers below compare the smell to crushed orange Pez candy, and they\'re right. There is indeed a slightly powdery quality to it, but it doesn\'t define the whole fragrance (I usually can\'t stand powdery scents). When smelled up close (nose against sprayed clothes or skin) it smells exactly like a menthol-orange cough drop. At first the citrus are totally unisex but after 30 mins or so, the Pez candy and menthol cough drop vibes disappear and the fragrance turns more feminine and reminds me of an orange bar soap. All in all, it\'s great but it lacks a certain personality or quality. Oyédo is very linear and simple. I wish it was more aromatic, or had mint or soft woods added to it, to make it a bit more complex and ""wearable"". I\'ll definitely wear it from time to time, but alone at home for my own pleasure.', 'First of all, what you are smelling is yuzu aka pomelo which is very realistic in the opening. Secondly, I absolutely hate orange blossom in fragrances and I don’t detect any orange in this toilette which I am thankful for. Diptyque listed only 3 notes: yuzu, green tangerine and thyme with raspberry as an olfactory accident. What I smell is exactly tangerine, yuzu and thyme. The cough syrup bit might also be the thyme and raspberry notes mixed together. It also pairs very well with Diptyque Olene. If you enjoy yuzu, you’ll like this one! Linear yet so refreshing!', 'VERY citrus - fake orange smelling, to be exact. Definitely ""unique"", but I\'m not sure if that\'s a good thing in this case. It smells extremely similar to orange Pez candies. Is it terrible? Nah, I wouldn\'t say so. Would I wear it aside from the testing I just did? Also nah. Poor longevity, as well. I\'ll pass.', ""Artificial/Synthetic doesn't always mean bad!.....To me, Oyedo reminds me of my childhood; I'd often buy some muscat grape flavoured chewing gums from the corner shop. I must admit that this is a loving or hating fragrance for some people, but I like it a lot. If someone prefers realistic lemony fragrance, then look for it somewhere else. Simple as that."", 'Smells like Christmas!  Very lovely citrus notes, and then not much else. Mandarins at the bottom of your stocking, happy memories, sweet and cute.', ""Although I was ecstatic to receive a sample of this from the flagship store in Paris, this is strange...not a realistic citrus. It smells half like citrus cough drops, and also like some kind of chalky citrus candy. Like orange Smarties or Vitamin C chews. It's also kind of bitter? I do get the thyme, which is the only part of this fragrance that I like. I'm sorry to report that I am not a fan :("", 'To me this scent smells synthetic and more like lemon pledge than anything else. I prefer nest and atelier for realistic citrus.', 'Maybe it’s because I have a large collection, but I love Oyedo, and I’m secretly happy it’s not more popular. Why? Because when I wear it, there’s a good chance no one else will be. Ok, so first things first: it’s a totally strange scent. A complete weirdo. Surprisingly this oddball is also really easy to wear, and that makes it charming. I understand the mentholated comments, I get that too, right after the most realistic, fizzy citrus (mandarin orange) opening I’ve ever encountered in a perfume.  The other two notes that play supporting roles are Yuzu and thyme. Both feel natural and blended well. This freaky sister dries down into a woody herbal base, so I get three stages of distinct development. It’s unique, it’s fun, and it’s a little strange. All good descriptors in my perfume playbook.', 'Smells very synthetic and reminds me of a bubblegum called jenka.', ""I LOVE this! I received a sample with my beautyhabit order and can't believe it has taken me THIS long to find this beauty! I read someone stated that it smells like cough drops. I can say that on my skin at least it smells NOTHING like cough drops. The strong Yuzu ensures that can't be a possibility but to each their own... This smells like the best most sweet and strong citrus I think I have ever smelled. That is saying a lot since I collect perfumes and thought I had already purchased all of the best citrus frags. This one REALLY lasts. It also projects well. Very nice and can't wait to get FB."", ""Photo-realism of a fresh orange being peeled and that big, bright burst of bitter and juicy citrus smell. It's like a soliflore for orange citrus. Too bad it is brief, and then it dies down to a nice woody spice. The complete dry-down doesn't turn into that soapy-perfume scent as so many citrus perfumes do, so I prefer wearing this when I need a refreshing, or 'clean' scent. I don't get the menthol note a lot of reviewers have mentioned. Just orange/citrus and wood + spice. Really well done, and I'm considering a full bottle although it is quite pricey. The value for me is that not many citrus perfumes are so fresh, full and bright as this one. Completely unique on the market."", ""guys this REALLY smells like those mentholated cough drops which is kind of impressive to capture and kind of a fun kick in the beginning, but not something i want to keep wearing. this got tiresome fast so i layered hermes eau d'orange verte on top and the combo was quite lovely! boosted dry citrus + less minty cough drop and a lovely woody drydown."", 'So good! An excellent fragrance, the best yuzu I have tried. It is very concentrated at the beginning, with a great realistic and natural yuzu that is both refreshing and elegant.  It has also strong mint and herbs which provide depth and richness. After a while the thyme is taking center stage which is making everything smell divine, together with woods in the background that are almost oud like but very light.

Starts juicy and eventually becomes quite fresh. To me this has everything I like about L'eau des Hesperides combined with L'eau de Neroli except it actually has the longevity and sillage to make it a worthwhile purchase. Surprisingly long lasting, not only for a citrus but also for a Diptyque EDT, which in my experience rarely last. Sillage isn't huge but again, impressive for a citrus/Diptyque EDT. Might lean masculine, but definitely unisex. Not getting the cloying or candied quality some people mention."", ""This one is quite unusual. I don't get the thyme in this, but i do definitely get a citrus flavoured menthol candy/ shower gel to properly wake you up (they should do the latter one!). This is actually the first perfume that made my skin tingle, as if i put some Vick's vapour rub on my neck. Quite weird."", 'I am reminded of a few things: orange tic tacs, orange halls cough drops, and Satsuma bubble bath by The Body Shop. A vibrant, slightly mentholated mandarin - very bright and uplifting, but seems to fade rather fast', 'There are a lot of Citrusy fragrance in market. What is your favorite ones? Annick Goutal, Atelier Cologne, Jo Malone, Xerjoff and …  Yes this is various market. Specially about Niche perfumes. Mostly they use Citrusy notes in combination to aromatic green notes (such as rosemary, thyme, cypress and…), woody notes (specially cedar wood & oak moss) and some spices such ginger.  This format usually common. As you are more aware citrus small volatile molecules have not long stability so they have to use some stronger base for improve this factor & which notes can act better green, woody aromatics? I think that the most important point for preference each one to others is just two things. First how much we get natural citrus smell & second, how much they could keep citrusy smell without significant effect of other notes.  Oyedo by diptyque use Yuzu, Orange and other its family member for creating very bold & sharp citrusy accord. This natural sense reminds me of orange garden with strength aromatic herbal smell that has a bit sweet vibe. Oyedo really has not woody fact in my opinion. I like its natural & lovely smell but its longevity isn’t satisfy at all. I recommend Acqua Viva Profumum Roma as a perfect, natural and strong choice for spring.', 'Totally fun, totally weird. Starts out with a sweet juicy blast of orange and yuzu, then the herbal thyme busts in and there’s a chilly mentholated cough-drop feel going on. In Japan taking a hot soak in a yuzu-filled bath is a way to welcome the winter solstice and this scent evokes that natural image, but at the same time it smells like a totally unnatural but delicious chewy orange “fruit snack” that I loved as a child, the kind that came in little plastic packages and were sometimes shaped like sharks. So, yeah, like I said—totally fun, totally weird.', ""Juicy herbal. Very sweet citrus opening (you can definitely make out the yuzu) with nose-tinglingly fizzy thyme underneath. Contradiction of nearly cloying juiciness with mentholated herbs. Pretty artificial smelling for a niche fragrance - reminds me of orange hand-soap. Expensive hand-soap but hand-soap nonetheless. Other people's mileage may vary though. Very long lasting, unusually so for a citrus fragrance, but this just seems to be further evidence Diptyque relied on artificial chemicals. Pleasantly cheerful."", 'I have stated this before, but I found this amazing place and all of you while searching for a long lost love.  It was a citrus perfume called ""Clementine"". I purchased 3 bottles between 1996 and 1998, but after that I had been unable to find it again.  I came here looking for this citrus dream. I wanted to smell it again but unfortunately it could not be found. Luckily,through this site, I have found soooo many new loves and I could not be happier with my growing collection. Back to the scent in hand... I received this beauty yesterday and I am so happy I did! The first spray is a strong but bitter citrus. It makes me say ""Whoa!"" but not in a good way, but almost instantly it becomes a soft and GORGEOUS citrus punch. It\'s pretty linear and just smells of citrus throughout the wearing. It is so reminiscent of my long lost ""Clementine"". Part of me wonders if some of this association is just time influencing my scent memory, but I can\'t shake it. This is as close as I have ever come to finding it again and I am soooo in love. There was a pleasant surprise in the drydown though, because to my nose, I almost smell something that smells like grape candy. In short, this is soooo yummy! Sillage seems to be moderate but longevity seems short. The one drawback I can see (and it is a BIG one) is the price tag. I have never spent 100$ on anything (other than cars and my wedding dress which was way more than 100$). But looks like, I\'ll be saving my pennies to buy myself a bottle of this lovely stuff!', 'Oyedo is bit different kind of a citrus that none has come close so far in my fragrance journey. In the beginning there is bright and sweet lemon with lime and/or yuzu and then there is this punchy menthol in there and it makes all the difference. This scent get instant lemony mint feeling for sore throat; I’m not sure about the brand nor the flavour but it is clear as day that’s what it reminds me of. When the mid comes it’s just intensity of the beginning that has dropped. Same could be said about the drydown as it’s really the same as mid but bit quieter with very slight woody note waving in the background trying to be noticed. Longevity is middle of the road for me and sillage is actually bit better than average citrusy scent as I do get way more wafts of it than I expected. Overall I do like Oyedo, so far it really is one of a kind in fragrances with its bright mentholated citrus scent. Linearity with this one could be good or bad depending how you see it, as for me I could not count it as a problem. Hotter summer weather is realm of Oyedo; rarely I think any fragrance is for just one season but with this one I could say just summer wear and in very casual situation.  I’m on the fence with this one, the scent is nice but it instantly reminds me of that good lemony mint and I’m not quite sure if I want to smell like it though. While lacking versatility and Finnish summer being what it is justifying bottle purchase of this is really hard for me though I might keep sample of this available as it is nice for hot lazy days.', 'A neglectable one from Diptyque. O-ye-NO! The biggest problem is that there is some greasy but sharp vibe in the base — smells like pine-seed oil that went bad — extremely annoying. It goes straight to your head with a huge dose of pungent menthol then paralyzes your neuro system immediately, and makes you feel a knife is stabbing your brain.  Besides, as some guys mentioned, it is too sweet, yet not that cloying for my taste though. Not to mention that the mandarin accord is very synthetic which is in line with Acqua di Parma Arancia di Capri, namely the same synthetic and too sweet ingredients. Trust me, you can find hundreds of better alternatives within the genre even with much lower budget on the market. Rating: 3.0/10', ""Very strange - lots of menthol and orange. If Vicks made an orange flavoured Vapour Rub, this is what it would smell like. There is a longer-lasting, subtle floral note, but it's swamped in the menthol - if I smelt this on someone I would assume they were undergoing some kind of treatment.

Maybe cough drops, for me that's the most convincing likeness in this reviews section. In any case, it's an extremely aromatic kind of citrus: very herbal, even medicinal. A bit bitter. It must be the thyme that's causing this, but in some kind of reaction with the citrus, because it doesn't smell like fresh or dried thyme to me. It's very original, and not a bad smell by any means, but I don't think I'd like to smell like this full-time.

Wrong bunny!"", 'I just bought and received some from hautelook. :) I think it is perhaps the yummiest summer fragrance I have this summer. :) all I needed was the lime ... and I was somewhere happy, squeezing limes for, well, perfume. ;)', ""This smells exactly like those hand wrapped hard orange candies that you would get as a kid. Very unique as far as a fragrance goes. But nothing amazing. What's amazing is how they got it to smell identical to the candy. Lol"", ""The happiness of a child in a bottle. Oyedo is the prince of all citrus based perfumes and it deserves the title of 'Made in Heaven'."", 'This js such a mood lifter WOW to me it smells like freshly peeled sugary ripe juicy tangerines. It smells like a tangerine sherbet sweets kids would like. It is a bit synthetic, in a way, but it is definitely a happy happy fragrance, very energising and refreshing. Not great longevity and after initial blast of fresh citrus, not very good projection either. Having said all that, I would so love to have a full bottle of this quite soon!', ""OMG alfarom. . . You crack me up ;D !  To my nose a yummy citrusy sweet bouquet. That's it. End of story."", 'smells like sweet lime and mandarin,very nice,great for summer.Very natural', 'This is exactly peeling like peeling a mandrin and eating it. The main note in this is a very natrual sweet juicy mandrin. I also get some hints of lemon and lime but they never overlap the mandrin. This scent also could have been called madarin Oranage and no one would argue.  This scent also has a light creamy vibe and some feint woods to support the scent. Very fresh and in my opinion one of the best citrus fragrances i have ever smelt. I have tried the hermes orange vert, some acqua di parma and some frederic malle scents that also have good citruss scents but to me this is the one.  As soon as i smelt this scent it took me to my childhood, when i used to really enjoy being out with my freinds in the summer heat. This fragrance just makes me happy. sillage is very good and lasting power is 4-6 hours than stays close to the skin. quite expensive £48 for a 50ml but does smell natural and expensive. Very modern unnisex scent, the scent itself is very straight forward and will not keep you guessing like some other fragrances. But having said that What you do get is a simple amazing smell. Scent 8/10', 'Diptyque OYEDO is a fresh citrus scent featuring petit grain or agrumes, it seems to me. This composition bears resemblance to some of the offerings of the house of Fresh. An inviting, natural-smelling citrus cologne with a touch of vetiver and perfect for warm weather. I must be anosmic to whatever is inspiring all of the shout-outs of ""odd!"" ""strange!"" and ""weird!"" To my nose, there is nothing revolutionary or earthshattering here at all, just a typical niche citrus creation made with high-quality components.  Many niche offerings strike me as similar to ice cream, offering variations on familiar, comfortable themes but using high-quality ingredients. No one is inventing anything radically new in the ice cream world at this point in time. The idea or, if you will, Platonic Form of ice cream is well-established, and we often find ourselves drawn to the classics. Although gourmet “innovators” may try to convince us that we want to eat basil or chickpea gelato, and those savory flavors may work well served as a small part of a larger presentation, the truth is that sometimes we just want a big bowl of good old-fashioned vanilla or chocolate ice cream well made. It\'s not a demerit to anyone\'s mind—and least of all their taste buds or tummy—that the best ice creams around are all copies of flavors that have been around for a very long time.  The same story holds, mutatis mutandis, for citrus colognes such as OYEDO, IMNSHO. This one works just fine—for what it is.', 'This is weird! Citruses in a bizarre, odd, almost unpleasant accord. Nothing really disturbing but way too strange. It\'s like they\'ve lost control while executing the original recipe and everybody got drunk at the Diptyque factory.  - ""Oh My god, was it a 2 or a 20 on the measuring cap?"" - ""which cap?"" - ""Forget It"" Rating: 8/10 (because it\'s sooo bizarre and unique) 6/10 (because I find it unwearable)', ""Extremely fresh and citrusy and delicious. My only complaint is that it fades into nothingness SO quickly on my skin. After an hour or two, I can't smell it anymore. Keep a vial of it with you to touch up during the day if you want it to last."", ""I tried this one at 6.p.m.- by 8.30p.m. - it absolutely disappeared.  Just a little lemon touch, that's all. I wonder, if I did the same with a sqeesed lemon on my skin, it would be the same."", ""Dig your nails deep into a tangerine & sniff the bitter oils that burst from the pitted skin.  Place a bowl of mandarine segments in syrup in the sun to warm & then slurp them up.  Pop a bubble of citrus-fresh washing up liquid.  Open a 3-peel & caraway seed hot-cross-bun & breathe in the orange-scented steam. Now rev up the intensity of these experiences & triple the mandarin juice content . . . this is what the juicy, fruity wake-up scent, Oyedo, is all about! Forget about the woods (what woods?) & don't worry much about the caraway....it is as if Diptyque popped a whole mandarin in each bottle, peel pulp & all. The whole fruit & nothing but the fruit. It avoids being cutsey, girly or frooty because this oddity is sour, bitter & real. Wearing Oyedo is an interesting experience...my mouth even watered! But who wants to masquerade as a mandarin?"", 'Detergent people are always thinking of something new for people to buy, however pointless it may be. Say, for example, cotton-candy-scented fabric softener. ""Yeah, great idea, let’s make a sticky-sweet-synthetic-citrus-fresh fabric softener.

On the drydown it gets to smell like very hops-heavy beer spilled over a barroom floor the preceding night. Actually, that is nearly an improvement. One of the all-time lows of niche perfumery', 'i was looking for a nice orange scent for a long time, i tested perfumes from Hermés, Aqua di Parma, Fragonard, Serge Lutens, Nicolai etc. But this one i really liked best!! it has a full bouquet and not too much woody spices. its a nice orange parfume!', 'Maybe it’s because I have a large collection, but I love Oyedo, and I’m secretly happy it’s not more popular. Why? Because when I wear it, there’s a good chance no one else will be. Ok, so first things first: it’s a totally strange scent. A complete weirdo. Surprisingly this oddball is also really easy to wear, and that makes it charming. I understand the mentholated comments, I get that too, right after the most realistic, fizzy citrus (mandarin orange) opening I’ve ever encountered in a perfume.  The other two notes that play supporting roles are Yuzu and thyme. Both feel natural and blended well. This freaky sister dries down into a woody herbal base, so I get three stages of distinct development. It’s unique, it’s fun, and it’s a little strange. All good descriptors in my perfume playbook.', ""You have to be a true and devoted citrus lover to enjoy Oyedo. It has the most fizzy, zesty, juicy, realistic citrus opening that I almost want to drink it! A bit of peppery sharpness to the nose in the opening, but I love that! When I spray it on myself, it's as if one person is spraying me down with fresh lemon spa water while another person squeezes fresh lemon halves close to my nose. It's as close to bathing in lemon as you can get (if you're into that - I am!) If you've ever juiced a lemon and those oils and juices wafted up to your nose and made your eyes roll back in your head, and wished you could bottle and wear that moment, THAT'S OYEDO. Although Diptyque products are not cheap, I think you get what you pay for because this one has really good longevity for a citrus frag, and probably the best longevity of all the citrus frags I've owned. I could still smell it on me HOURS later. Of course the top notes had faded, but the fragrance was still there and in good concentration. Unisex 100%."", ""If you're from Thailand, Philippines, or Singapore, and you have walked in a Made in Candy store, give this perfume a sniff and I know you can attest to it smelling exactly like Made in Candy. Oyedo also reminds me of lemon candy/lemon drops. It's so yummy! I love it so much, and my boyfriend loves it too (I think he loves it on me waaayy more than I do haha)!"", ""I am very surprised by how unique this smells, especially from a house I don't really prefer.  This is an excellent take on a bright tangy citrus with candied undertones, with a sprinkle of raspberry transitioning into a minty slightly herbal slightly woody musky base. However, unlike other candied citruses, this one skips the typical 'fundip' like cloyingly sweet fizzy tones of something like Atelier Cologne Pomelo Paradis for a tart fresh herbal base that reminds of something between fruity berry lozenges and tart lemon drops. Very nice, refreshing, with good longevity (about 6 hours on my skin),  It actually slightly reminds me of l'Artisan Parfumeur Mure et Musc without any of the soapiness only in the way it contains a tart fruity heart note that feels very close to the thin tart scent of an actual raspberry. Excellent, one of my new favorite citruses, a great candle scent too."", 'When you are very hot, spray directly all over your skin, this citrus fragrance, it cool you very well.

Seasonally speaking, this one reminds me of late Winter. The weather is still cool but not frigid. Looking out a window on a rainy day, tea in hand, onto a garden on where branches are still bare, but you can see the buds just beginning to form. ON ME, I get the following notes in order of prominence: sweet, then tea, then smoke, then spice--emphasis on the *me* part, because I've seen the notes listed in varying configurations in other reviews. Isn't body chemistry fascinating? I even noticed a slight variation in notes between my Left and Right wrists. (I like it better on my Left, lol.) On to the notes: (1) SWEET - mostly honey-sweet on me, which I actually love. (2) TEA - citrus-y black tea notes. Definitely an Early Grey vibe, as I can smell the bergamot. (3) SMOKE - this was the only note on me that I was not super fond of. I was hoping for a lapsang souchong, and ended up with more of a stale-cigarette-smoke-lingering-on-clothes kind of deal, though I suspect that this effect was just something interacting in a wonky way w/ my own chemistry. Luckily the strong cigarette thing mellowed out after a while to become more pleasingly smoky. (4) (warm) SPICE - I was hoping to have this note more prominent, as I love spicy scents. On me the spices just *whispered,* but the effect was still lovely. I could not smell the ginger and anise detected by others, but that could just be because my nose is not as sophisticated as ya'll'ses noses. I smelled clove most strongly, followed by vanilla. Overall: 4.75/5. Love love love, and SO bummed this has been discontinued."", 'My preciousssss…. Everyone please stop buying what’s left of the bottles of this masterpiece. There is truly nothing like it and Olivia Giacobetti is an absolute genius.', ""I don't have the pleasure to know the original scent, but I just bought a clone, and it is absolutely divine. The clove is prominent, it blends wonderfully with the other spices and tobacco, complimenting but not overwhelming the tea scent. There is a delightful vintage aspect, it is warming, elegant, comforting, very unique. The spicy aspects are balanced with just enough sweetness that it doesn't become simplistic or trying hard to be easily consumable, as it is the case with tons of modern fragrances with sweet notes. Very naturalistic, beautiful, meditative, festive tea scent. It is such a shame that it has been discontinued, and I'm so happy to have at least grabbed a clone of it."", 'Tea For Two is probably my favorite fragrance of all time. I’ve had the old bottle and now the new bottle, and at first I thought I hated the new bottle because I was getting sort of an old cigarette ash smell after a bit, but I finally figured out that only happens if I wear it with cashmere, so something about the fiber and the fragrance don’t mix. So now I even love the new bottle. I can’t compare it to anything, I mostly have LAP fragrances and haven’t tried any other fragrances similar to Tea For Two. For me it’s a soft, snuggly blanket of scent, sweet and spicy and very close to the skin, and I wear it in fall and winter, although with it being discontinued I am saving it for special occasions only now.', ""cloth test nice. very sweet, like sugar in tea?

The one out of a dozen tea perfumes I've tried that actually smells like tea is the one that also has something in that I'm allergic to. Scrubber :( even though I like the smell.

Anyway, I don't see how anyone would want to wear this. Sadly."", '#2 on my hunt for a warm cosy tea based signature cold weather fragrance This one disappointed me on first sniff, I could barely detect any Tea note and it reminded me of what a florist smells like; flower stems. However, my nose mustve been cooked because boy am I glad I gave it another try. Its a very spicy tea scent with subtle whiffs of sweetness from the honey/vanilla in the base. I wish the sweetness was a bit more forward in this fragrance as personally the spice is a touch too prominent causing the fragrance to not feel very wearable. I can appreciate smelling it but I\'m not sure others would. Definitely a cold weather fragrance, I could probably see it wearable for special occassions where you want to make a bit of a statement. Partners verdict: ""very strong spices""', 'Warm cinnamon and peppercorn spice with gentle smoke. Immediately delivers that sweet spot that makes Gucci Pour Homme II so popular. This is woodier, but softer, and without the bright blue/fresh chord. Restrained iron fireplace and tobacco adds cowboy edge, making top note unique. Masculine chord also matures the warm cinnamon/ginger. Raw honey adds balance without being too sweet. Different...while cozy, sexy, and a little dirty. This is Gucci Pour Homme II while riding a motorcycle in Autumn. Good strength/projection. Unique and easily likable take on the genre that seems bottle-worthy.  1ST REVIEW: Applies extra warm/sexy Gucci Pour Homme II with smoky lapsang souchong. Rich with spice from dry cinnamon/gingerbread adds complicated edge. Nuanced honey and vanilla creates a sexy sweet tobacco vibe countered by tangy/metallic burnt sandalwood. Gucci Homme II is bigger and more in your face blue, while this is spicy and sexy with a smoky manly edgy.', ""I randomly chose this for a recent decant splurge and I am soooo glad I did.

I disagree that the two smell similar.', 'I have a review on Gucci Pour Homme 2 basically saying how good this one is lol & not much else..I own Both in they are almost the same but this is niche quality where the other is more designer quality if you’re really trying hard to pick them apart…This is the most comforting scent! It smells like actual black tea bags and reminds me of the soft golden foil with some of the tobacco out of the cigarettes at the bottom of the pack of ciggerettes…No note breakdown I’m not that good.

According to the notes listed, it should be a great spicy-smoky-aromatic tea fragrance, but upon the first spray, I smelled only a ghost of a fragrance Tea for Two could be. It smells like a diluted sweetened black tea with dried fruits (dried plum) that you left on a table for a few hours. Tobacco is weak and honey is off-putting here.

I think I washed it off the first time, but came across it again and just past the initial tobacco blast the ginger and tannins settled in and completely intrigued me.  It is not wonderful or anything and you definitely don’t need a bottle, so you might as well sell it to me.

I don’t get gourmand from this, which is good since I don’t generally enjoy gourmands - it opens smoky on me, occasionally to the point of cigarette butts, but not quite.  As the smoke recedes I get spices over tea, in a way that is reminiscent of a Thai tea over a chai. There’s no milky note in this, on me. I get a little leather and vanilla as it goes on, occasional whiffs of smoked tobacco.  I have the new bottle, rather than the old version with the gold cap - and I don’t find it particularly long lasting.

I hadn’t thought of that. So, don’t be overwhelmed by the initial smokiness because it will fade a lot. The scent is very cozy and warm, in fact like a nice sweetened tea.

It’s warm, natural and somehow fresh.  I have not read any of the reviews below, and I’m sure everything has already been said about this beauty. Wow, I can’t get over that this came out in 2000, and there’s not a hint of being dated. That means it was ahead of its time.', ""I get the comparisons to Spice Bomb -- it actually initially feels like a (more basic -- not in a bad way) cousin of Jovoy Remember Me. If Remember Me is the one dancing on a table, Tea for Two is documenting it on the side. I smell ginger, tea, and tobacco most. I will say, though I find it very pleasant, it's not leaving a lasting impression. I had to smell this blotter several times before I had words to say about it, just because I had such a neutral reaction."", ""Spices and tobacco come off strong in the beginning. It's not peppery, and there is not much ginger. They fade away into lapsang souchong tea (not the drink but the tin of loose leaves itself) with a drop of lemon.

Does not last long."", 'Just received a 2ml sample of this along with my big purchase …Poivre Picante (haven’t fully experienced that one enough for an opinion but im excited! I also love noir exquis) at first spray all I could smell with Tea for Two was Lapsang Souchong which is among my favorite black teas! Id describe it as bonfire tea, like drinking literal burning twigs and leaves…Smoky to say the least, but also lovely and earthy…that lasts about 5 min and then tea for two turns soapy for me and then after reading all the ginger bread notes and hobby lobby in other reviews…Im definitely getting that after about 20 min…it’s got that holiday candle your grandma is burning in the house in late autumn vibe..it’s warm and memory triggering and I like it! It’s definitely got a unisex vibe. But in a way that’s like I picture an older gentleman wearing it but also I picture my grandmothers house smelling like this and there’s something feminine and comforting about it. I do wish the initial lapsang souchong tea smell lasted throughout as it developed but I can’t detect it after about an hour. Hmmm not sure if id purchase a full size of this AND it’s discontinued but I might sample at a different time of the year and change my mind ugh that’s what’s awful about discontinued stuff, im tempted to buy it NOW. Where im at it’s late spring, first nice day after rain and gloom for weeks it seems like…but now it’s 65 degrees and it feels like the wrong time for this perfume.

The smokiness makes me cough. But I still really like it, and I find it very cozy and wearable.', ""Tea For Two is very simply spicy, smoky, ever-so-slightly-sweet heaven.  I have a great deal of personal affection for this fragrance, as it was one of the first niche fragrances I ever tried, way back when I was just a newbie on my fragrance journey. I read somewhere that Tea For Two was very similar to Gucci’s Gucci Pour Homme II, a scent that I owned and loved back in my university days before I was into the whole perfume thing.  I discovered that Gucci Pour Homme II and Tea For Two are not all that similar. But I also discovered one of my first fragrance loves.  When I got my sample of Tea For Two, I was pretty challenged by it at first. The opening of the fragrance is extremely spicy and even somewhat sharp, and I still think it’s like that today. The note of star anise, just as polarizing a smell as it is a polarizing taste, is very much present. The star anise, combined with all the other spices, tobacco, and the smoky, almost gunpowder-like lapsang souchong tea note, were a bit of a shock to my system.  About twenty minutes into a wearing of the fragrance, though, magic starts to happen. The smokiness and sharpness begin to subside, and Tea For Two becomes a lot more mellow. The vanilla and honey serve to soften the rough, harsh edges, taking some of the astringency out of the mix and making the experience a whole lot cozier. The spices and smoke never fully go away, but their frequencies lower and blend seamlessly with the other elements of the fragrance.  This really does smell like opening up a box or a tin of holiday spice tea bags, almost bang on. You can imagine this sort of smell wafting through the air as your tea is brewing in a thick, snowman-shaped mug (though the tea-brewing smell is not as authentically captured here as it is in Masque Milano’s Russian Tea), a plate of gingerbread cookies off to one side. However, by no means does this smell like a candle or holiday room spray.  The blending, like in all L’Artisan fragrances in my experience, is superb. If you look at the note list, you might imagine that Tea For Two is a dense, heavy sort of fragrance that might quickly become overbearing, but it’s really not that at all.  There is a light touch, a transparency here that reminds me of Ambre Narguilé from Hermès. That fragrance similarly features a lot of heavy notes like tobacco, cinnamon, incense, and dried fruits, but somehow manages to be airy and effortless at the same time. Tea For Two might open with a spicy, smoky fullisade, but the overall wearing experience is quite comfy and unobtrusive.  In short, Tea For Two is a spicy tea lover’s dream. If you are at all a fan of chai, lapsang souchong, rooibos, or any kind of spiced tea, you need to get your mitts on this one right here.  Performance is perfect, just what it should be: long-lasting with intimate projection and sillage. It's a beautiful, cozy experience for yourself and for anyone who comes into close proximity, but it's not loud at all.  For me, personally, it's a 10/10"", 'The notes and description sound amazing - like we were meant to be! But I was cursed and this smells like burning rubber on my skin, unfortunately. I think it’s a me problem, more than the scent since it smelled fine before it met my skin', ""This scent is truly unique. I had to let it rest after it was delivered because all I could smell at first was the smokiness. After a couple of days, I could appreciate the spices, esp the anise. I sometimes find anise really overwhelming but it was very nicely balanced in this fragrance. It does smell very spicy and dry, like entering a store selling lots of tea and spices. The tea here is black and very deep and as others already said, smells like Lapsang Souchong tea. It's smoky and very distinct. Longevity is not the best, around 4-5 hours only on me. I think this scent is best worn during cold weather."", 'very sweet, too sweet for my liking but if you like honey scents you would love this but personally not my thing', 'I loved the initial cozy, sweet blast, but it immediately settled into a distinct medicinal camphor note that I found very unpleasant', ""I am reminded of a malty, sweet, smoky cup of Russian Caravan with a dollop of honey when wearing Tea for Two. Russian Caravan is is a blend of oolong, keemun, and lapsang souchong teas. Its name originates from the 18th century camel caravans that facilitated the transcontinental tea trade, from tea-producing areas to Russia. I first recall learning of Russian Caravan from purchasing the Twinings brand blend several years ago while perusing the various teas at Cardullo's in Harvard Sq, Cambridge MA.  Much like Russian Caravan, Tea for Two is mellow and subtle. It is no statement fragrance, but it is no gossamer milquetoast that must be detected by burying one's nares to their wrist, at least for the first five or so hours. In the heart, its as if tea has been served with some gingerbread and spiced cookies, which reminds me of how much I love to dip cookies and biscuits into a hot cup of tea. However, there is nothing overly sweet about the experience at all, as the further into the dry down we go, tea leaves merge into tobacco leaves and the experience is drier, with elusive wafts.  While outside, Tea for Two seems to augment rather than overpower the natural scents of my surroundings—which was especially nice on this autumn morning."", 'To me Tea for Two smells like a Lapsang Souchong tea with some dried fruits added. Beautiful. A black tea with a smoky twist and some fruity nuances, far from being sweet though. I’ve heard stories, that L’Artisan Parfumeur discontinued it and then, few years ago they decided to re-release it. Is this true? Well, most likely yes, because this is available on the company’s website. I like it very much! Fits my taste.', 'Spicy! So excited to wear this during the holidays .

Very beautiful, might take time to become fond of it. Just let it sit on your skin."", ""Phenomenal. Spicy sweet black Tea. I've realised I enjoy darker tea fragrances more than lighter ones such as Wulong Cha and Atelier Colognes tea based scents"", ""I'm not a big fan of tea fragrances, and lucky for me I don't get a ton of tea in this one. To my nose this is all about spices (mainly ginger and cinnamon) and tobacco. This opens very dry, and smells like a dry tea bag with a ton of spices. About 15-20 minutes in, the tobacco starts to come through and it's a honeyed tobacco which adds some sweetness. From that point on I honestly don't get much tea. It reminds me quite a bit of fragrances like Spicebomb and Tobacco Vanille--same vein for sure. Lasts on my skin about 4.5 hours, and longer on clothes.

""Like"" for this unusual niche smell.', 'My second L’artisan (I also own and reviewed Couleur Vanille). A very bold and unique perfume - truely an olfactory journey. It conjures up images of dark smoke filled dens, off crowded market alleyways, with tea being sipped amongst the cloth bags filled with spices of the orient.  The tea is upfront and makes no apologies about it. To me it is like a Chinese black tea, but the subtle bergamot pulls it back a little to Earl Grey style tea. Maybe the tea is a mix of them both. Star anise follows for me, and then it’s the cinnamon lead rich oriental style mixed spices. Ginger plays softly in the background, popping up only time to time, but always there in the background keeping the balance fresh. Once the perfume dries down, the smoky undertones can fully be appreciated. I get a lot of tobacco and some vanilla, but not really leather / honey as per the perfume notes pyramid above. Possibly they are there in the background. I support people describing this as a chai tea fragrance. The spice mix is very chai, at least to begin with. I can say that one small sample spray on the wrist is not enough. Wear this to test with 4 plus good sprays from a full bottle (not a sample bottle) - then and only then will you appreciate how dark and smoky this tea perfume is. After a few hours the spices mellow to sleep, and this really is a dark, mysterious, smoky black tea and tobacco scent. This is an autumn and winter superstar for me. Could wear at the office. Probably not good for going out for dinner. Great at home in front of the fire. Afternoon autumn / winter walks (it will keep you warm). Wouldn’t wear in summer time I don’t think. Down the middle unisex. High quality as expected from this house. I suppose this is a gourmand? About as far as you can get from Jo Malone earl grey and cucumber! Less versatile than some, but more interesting than most. Test for a day before buying. Thrilled with this purchase.', 'I just received a new bottle from an italian perfumery who still have them with the 2020 price, because i saw it disappeared from L’Artisan website and i was worried it would go discontinued (if anyone knows, please tell).

I am not letting him steal it just yet, I want to try again in winter because I can see how it has potential, but I will pass it on to him if it doesn't grow on me and just curl up with my Noir Exquis, which I LOVE.😍😍😍"", ""Spiced tea with a hint of sweetness from the vanilla and honey. Very realistic from a gourmond perspective as I feel like I've had this poured in a cup before.

Perfect for fall when it gets a little crisp outside and the leaves are changing color."", 'At L\'Artisan they do not have, as other Houses, a distinguished ""signature feature"" that accomunate all their fragrances. I mean, you smell a Chanel and even if you sniff blindfold, you know it is a Chanel.  Parfums de Nicolai are the same, so the old Guerlains. They all have a leading (or subduing) trail that is instantly recognisable. Well, L\'Artisan makes very different fragrances. Different one from the others I mean! May I like them or hate them - I must admit that their variety ad originality must be praised in any way.  Ditto for Tea for Two. I was expecting an English Tea gathering with sandwiches and cookies smells. Wrong! what you get is an instant medicinal blast (the Vicks VaporRub if you see) that totally uncompassed me.  The strange initial notes go away almost immediately just to leave space to...the smoke! Tobacco, cigar, cigarette and spices.  I am reminded of the smokey notes in good old (10 years or 16 years old one, to me) scotch whiskey. It is that crisp, dry smokey note. A lot of spice: clove cinnamon ginger. All nose tickling. Not what you thought teas would have been all about.  But then after a few minutes, you get those unique notes of fermented black tea - the finest quality one- and then you think... ah...""it was that tea!"".

You must try it!', ""I love tea as a perfume note, but I'm not fond of spicy scents, so I should have known that this one wouldn't be my thing. This really is like chai tea, not bitter or bright at all, just very warm and spicy. Besides smoky tea I get a lot of ginger, cinnamon, and star anise, with a good dollop of tobacco for good measure. Not bad, but just really not my taste - it's so warm I desperately long for something fresh for contrast, but unfortunately I don't get any bergamot, which could have done a lot to improve this composition for my personal taste, and I don't even get any honey or vanilla. No escape from the spicy dry warmth at all - which is a plus if that's your thing, but it isn't mine. On top of that, longevity is also quite poor; I'd expect more from such a strong scent but after an hour or two I can barely smell it anymore.

Overall it feels like a warm cup of lapsang & earl grey tea with a side of gingerbread on a cold autumn day. I am very skeptical of honey in perfumes, since it often has that cloying synthetic honey note that makes me sick to my stomach, but this one is soft and mixes very well with everything else.

On a sunny day, it would be nice to smell the mountain with fallen leaves, and on a rainy day, I want to smell this perfume when healing while listening to the sound of the rain. I could feel a lot of the aroma of tea and tobacco leather."", ""This one isn't meant for smelling up close, because smelling up close (at least initially) is like smelling heated/warmed plastic.

There is also a good dose of tobacco in here, with raises another fragrance similarity. If your'e familiar with TF Tobacco Vanille, the warm spicy tobacco facets are fairly similar between them. If you add a tea note to TV, you will have a fairly clear picture of Tea for Two. The thing is, I don't know whether the tea really works in this type of fragrance. The fresh herbal greenness of it doesn't quite blend together with the bakery-like smells in the rest of the composition. It's a unique direction to take tea in, but I prefer the crisper slant Gucci takes. Such a shame they discontinued it. I like it, but not bottle-worthy.

I don't really get a distinct tobacco, but I can see how some people would make that association with all the sweet spices that are used here. Upon the drydown it's a little powdery. Performance is average, and falls in line with the majority of L'Artisans releases. I really do like this, and if it were easier to come by I wouldn't mind having a full bottle. At the price it does go for, I don't think I'll need to seek out a large amount, but I will enjoy my sample."", ""This one reminds me a lot of Gucci Pour Homme II. Like a niche version of it but with more emphasis on Fall/Winter (GPII is more of Spring/Summer scent to me). The 3 main notes that make them similar are tea, cinnamon and tobacco. While Guci gets green (Violet Leaves) and fresh, this one gets more smokey in the opening (I assume that's the leather accord) and a lot spicier with honey on the background. While the openings are different, in the dry down they are a lot closer. Tea scents are not for everyone, so I suggest you test it with 2-3 full wearings before committing to a bottle. But if you already have tea frags in your collection, this might be worth a blind buy (especially if you are familiar with the Gucci)."", ""Nice earl grey style opening quickly followed by tobacco and a honey accord. The scent gets a bit smokier and spicier as time passes but the tea note remains the main player throughout the life of the fragrance. For me the tobacco is fairly present and in the far drydown I get a bit more pronounced sweetness reminding me of some sort of gingerbread. In typical Giacobetti style, the scent wears very light and after minutes it becomes a skin scent. The longevity is no more than a few hours, but this is to be expected with most L'Artisan's unfortunately. I have the new, black style bottle so I can't compare the current version with the ''vintage'' one. Does lean more masculine in my opnion, but for anybody who is a fan of tea based scents this is definitely one to sample.

I don\'t get much tobacco here - don\'t be afraid of it. What is felt in the heart is 1) spicy lemon tea; 2) honey; 3) some isolated spices - especially pepper. Ginger, anise and cinnamon do not appear alone, they are in less volume - a little immersed in the composition of the spicy palette that gives taste to the tea. Very sweet, hot, tasteful ... very pleasant, but it makes me afraid to get sick of a perfume that is so excessively comfortable.

Warm, exotic, sensual, comfy. All of these and more describe the beauty of Tea For Two, which has become my ""cozy"" home scent. I spray this on while watching something, playing games, or working on something and instantly feel more relaxed. This would be a beautiful cuddling scent for a lazy fall morning, sipping away at a cup of spiced tea and eating a bowl of oatmeal full of cinnamon and walnuts. Longevity is around 5-6 hours on my skin, with average longevity and meh sillage. This fragrance is not a loud, beast mode performer, and it never had any pretentions about being one. This is for intimate moments with yourself or your lover, or the times in your life when you feel most at peace. Try before you buy though, as star anise can be challenging, and this fragrance is definitely anise forward.

I mainly got this sample because I desperately wanted to try Noir Exquis and needed to pick a second sample from the L‘Artisan website. And now I like Tea for Two even more than Noir Exquis. This is such an unique scent, I have never smelled something quite like this before. The opening smells like a cup of black tea with lemon and honey, standing in some sweet smoke. Not sure where the smoke is coming from, but I can see a cinnamon stick and an anise star swimming in the tea cup. It‘s very warm and cozy, a little sweet, spicy and also fresh. This has a liquid feel, like freshly brewed tea, not like dry tea leaves, and it‘s not bitter.  As it dries down, it slowly and seamlessly transitions from tea to tobacco. It‘s starting to feel denser and smells like sweet pipe tobacco with spices, especially cinnamon. But there is still always a hint of tea and smoke left.  This is a really interesting take on tea and on the gourmand genre in general. This has nothing to do with the usual fresh and light tea fragrances. It‘s a fragrance I could imagine wearing on a stormy, rainy autumn day to warm myself up. A must try for anyone who likes unsual, warm fragrances.', 'it starts off creamy, delicately sweet, then you notice the mixture of spices & tea  then it got funky on my skin - i smelled an ozonic/aquatic note similar in blue fragrances that really turned me off  a thick heady ink pen mixed with synthetic chai, earl grey tea, & artificial gingerbread without the spicy kick of real ginger  not for me', ""It's a heavy, thick and dark tea scent... It resembles tobacco a bit, but it is really the scent of Lapsang Souchong tea. A very rich composition, it's dark and heavy without ever getting lighter. it smells bitter, warm, unforgivenly audacius. No wonder it is famous. Do not blind buy this, it's not for everyone, but a must for tea lover. If you are searching for matcha (japanese green tea) fragrance, you may want to check out Margiela's Tea Escape or Satori's Oribe, if you like ceylon tea try Atelier Cologne's Philtree Ceylan (FYI, Oolong Infini is an utter disappointment), if you feel like a English breakfast tea with flower addition, try Equinox Bloom from Penhaligon's, and if you love tea fusion, try Zoologist's Panda."", ""Not a bad fragrance. It starts off with the typical L'Artisan DNA that exists in Dzonkha and other scents...with a cinnamon/anise/vanilla spiced black tea. While I generally prefer green tea scents, I do like a few black tea scents.  But I personally don't like gourmand scents, and Tea for Two crosses that line for me. When a scent smells more like something I would eat/drink vs something I would wear, then I rethink wearing it.  The cinnamon and vanilla is just a bit too much for me. I feel like I am sitting down to tea and sweet biscuits at a british cafe. I think it is the biscuit part that bothers me the most. Reasonable sillage and longevity. If you like gourmands or some of the notes, feel free to give this a look. It is a pass for me."", 'Ultimately a deeper and more potpourri-smelling Body and Soul by Lomani. The sillage is essentially identical, although the ashiness of T42 really comes out in the mid.  A great holiday scent that smells like it would layer nicely with some kind of vanilla; so if you can scoop it up for less than or equal to the price of Body and Soul, this is the better option IMO.', ""Incredible scent. I actually prefer the scent of Gucci Homme II but it doesn't have any staying power whatsoever, this one does. It is a smokier and spicier tea than in GHII and is less sophisticated feeling as such but it is just as if not more comforting. I have seen reviews that say this just smells like cigarette ash to them and I think that is a shame because if your nose can pickup some of the more subtle notes over the top of that smokey base it really elevates this into an absolutely top level scent imho. 9/10."", 'This should have been named Tobacco for Two.  It opens up with fresh bitter note which I guess is the tea, but that lasts for 3 minutes and then all I smell is tobacco all the way until the end.

Tea for Two fittingly gives a tea-dominant vibe, somewhere in the chai or lapsang souchon range, teas that I don't like drinking but of which I enjoy the smell. It's spicy due a mix of cinnamon and ginger that I can only describe as appealing but nonetheless slightly challenging to my nose, as ginger, in particular, sometimes is. Certainly more at the onset of application and first couple of hours than the later dry down does the ginger say, provoke me. Fortunately, the honey aptly mitigates some of the spicy effects throughout the life of the fragrance, and the cinnamon, at least, is an ever-so-slightly sweet-leaning spice due to associations with dessert foods more so than savory items. Performance is decent, certainly some nice projection for hours and for $102 for 100ml on FragranceNet, it's certainly a reasonable-enough price if one loves it, especially given its versatility and innovation. 8 out of 10"", ""At first, after a couple of minutes, a strong combination of tobacco and honey hit me right in the face and I was soo disappointed cause I really don't like honey notes in perfumes.

I did find this fragrance too sweet and a little too mass appealing for a niche. I would have enjoyed this with a stronger tea note or with some patchouli.

My name for this is Unlit Winston In Bloom. Nice stuffy cozy smell, like you spent a rainy afternoon in the basement of a college library looking through old yellowing books!

Sweet, sultry, and tomboyish (or curiously masculine)."", ""The perfume of Alice in Wonderland's tea party! Lapsang Souchong flavored with cinnamon, honey and ginger.

I do love drinking tea and the teatime, and I was not convinced it would be possibile to make a rich cup of tea into perfume. I was wrong. In the exact moment that I put this frag to my nose, I had a perfect vision of a Victorian living room lit by the sun of a spring afternoon, and two elegant ladies dressed in white and flowers, sitting on the sofa, chatting while sipping a fragrant and spicy hot black tea. On the small table next to the saucers, a small buffet of sweets, decorated with vases of white flowers. To be clear, they are not two elderly Victorian ladies, but two young women in their prime.

Am i the only one experiencing this with T42???"", ""I just sprayed a sample on maybe 30 minutes ago, and I can't stop smelling my forearm.

The whole scent is just completely overwhelmed by suffocating smoke."", 'Early in my fragrance journey I tried a sample of this and remembered liking it. Fast forward a few years and I ran across a good deal on a bottle, so I added TF2 to my collection. I am glad that I did.  The opening of this fragrance is the best part to my nose. I get a very strong tea note with great projection for about an hour, then it settles down to a skin scent. The tea note is joined by a slight tobacco and honey accord. Throughout the day I am getting whiffs of tea, tobacco and honey. A very nice combination. I will have to try this again in the warmer weather.  TF2 is very much a unisex fragrance to my nose and I can wear this in either formal or casual attire.

I was hoping for a tranquil and understated fragrance, perhaps a warmer, spicier version of Osmanthe Yunnan...but, really, this is a tobacco- and honey-centred frag, and that's about it. The tobacco goes through a brash, almost ashtray-like phase, with honey and tea occasionally, somewhat desperately trying to announce themselves. It then settles into a fairly pleasant, indistinct, sweet base. Like some of the other reviewers, I like all the notes in principle, but the actual scent is just meh, despite being quite strong."", ""Firstly, I don't think this is unisex. It's so nuclear and gourmand in the opening that it comes across as very feminine. I like this fragrance but it switches around on me, between tea/tobacco, and fag ash/coca cola. I've tried a few different tobacco-based fragrances now, including TV and Tabac Rouge by Phaedon. Where TV is cloying and rich, and Tabac Rouge is airy and elusive, this one is kind of fizzy and distorted. Part of me feels that it doesn't meet the sophistication of it's own notes, and it comes across loud and frumpy even though I'd prefer otherwise."", 'Wonderful spicy tea fragrance that I really liked until the drydown, when all the sweet wore off', ""Oh, how I wish I got the smoke or spices other people talk about. Had high hopes for this as I've loved other Olivia Giacobetti things and I'm English, so have tea in my DNA. It's the smell of comfort and strength as well as warmth and the East, so a good fragrance would mean a lot to me. I get through mugs full of chai brewed with extra spice and very little sugar most days, and wanted something scented to take me there in the dark times between mugs. But Tea for Two? Sadly NOT what it says on the tin. For me it's just got the faintest touch of a good dark tea smell - like a nicely brewed cup of Assam - and there are hints of promise for the first 5-10 minutes. But then all that is almost completely overwhelmed in wave after sickly wave of sweet honey and syrup ... and that's all. It's a perfectly acceptable sort of sweetness but so much blander and less individual than I was hoping for. ETA: delighted to say I was wrong about this one! It's all in the atmospherics. Trying it again on damper skin (just showered and moisturised), the tea blossomed and the spices finally turned up. Overall this is still too sweet and honeyed to be my perfect cup of tea, but so much better than I'd thought before. If you have problems with it, try in varying humidity/temperatures and see if mutates into something you like better."", ""I get no tea, just the most blessedly real, smoky, warm, dry pipe tobacco I've been searching for. Yum."", 'This fragrance did not impress me at all. I teased my olfactory imagination with the image of a black tea boiling, almost burning, in the teapot.

Literally."", 'There is honey, spice, smokiness. This smells like an old wooden cupboard where you would store your tea supplies. There are many positive notes here, but much of it is lost in the complexity. I have mixed feelings, I like the individual notes on paper, but as a whole in this mixture, I think it’s underwhelming. So much potential is lost here. It is a very strong and interesting scent. One worth returning to for further evaluation. 6.5-7/10', ""Tea for two! Who can resist such a treat? I can’t speak for my wife, but I’ll have mine with extra spices and a touch of honey please! Coincidentally, Tea for Two (what an inviting name) is a dead ringer for this desired flavor. It is a very cozy and comforting scent that immediately conjures to mind the cold wintery nights when you just want to cuddle up with your loved one, hiding under a blanket, watching your favorite movies and simply enjoying a good ol' cup o' tea. In turn, this leads me to believe that it could be the cure for a dreadful long Canadian winter, or even a blistering Siberian winter. This tea is noticeably smoky considering the leading role in the fragrance is lapsang souchong – a popular variety of black tea originated from China where the leaves are smoke-dried. Though not the type of tea we’re probably accustomed to, and very likely an acquired taste, the smokiness is by no means overpowering in this composition. It serves like a fireplace, burning slowly by your side to provide you with its subtle warmth, and always reminding you of its presence. As the lapsang souchong smolders in the background a bold mixture of spices strike an entrance. Actually, let me rephrase that; a raging army of spices! Just close your eyes for a few seconds and babble out the names of spices that instantly come to your mind, whatever they are I’m willing to bet that those spices are all blended in Tea for Two. Sure, that might sound a bit of an exaggeration, but I cannot deny how nostalgic this part of the fragrance becomes as it literally transports me to Christmas time when chai tea, eggnog and gingerbread cookies are regularly indulged. This sense of nostalgia is exactly why I keep Tea for Two within reach; for those times that I just want to recollect the wonderful holiday memories. Simply put, the experience is as close as it gets to time travel! But, do allow the fragrance to settle as it sweetens up a smidge with the additions of honey and vanilla, think of it as adding a sugar cube to your chai if you will. And, to wrap up my overall impressions, I can definitely confirm that Tea for Two could easily be enjoyed by both sexes. So, rekindle those beautiful memories with that special someone, together."", ""I've bougth this after many positive reviews I've read...without trying on my skin. Even though I prefer Gucci II, both have terrible performance. I've worn Gucci II in windy days that way I could get whiffs of it time to time. With Tea For Two, no matter what I do I don't smell it on me. Also it burns my skin so bad. So far I am wearing this at home while having tea sesions with friends in our apartment, no one ever told me any positive or negative thoughts about how I smell because they can't smell anything. After an hour I even can't tell myself if I am wearing this. Anyway after months of using today before I leave to work at 8:30 a.m. I decided not to burn my skin anymore and sprayed it in my underwear twice, six hours passed I can still smell it now at my office! That's I believe how I'm going to finish the bottle. Most reviews says they smell vanilla in this. My nose don't agree with that. The sweetness is from honey note. While Gucci II is just right for Spring this is good for Fall...ofcourse only if I sprayed on my underwear!"", ""Oh wow. I'm in love! This is perfect. So spicy and yummy. Buy list. Reminds me of Tom Ford tobacco vanilla but in a more complex spicy less overbearing tobacco kindof way. It's great. 30 minutes later...this isn't really a laster :( That's sad, I love this scent. Might buy it anyway if it goes on megasale."", ""Tea for Two is one of the more scarce L'Artisan perfumes it seems. Even the most comprehensive stockists seem to be out of this stuff in recent years. I had tried this a long time ago and then got hold of some samples a few months back, which reminded me that T4T was on my radar. I was very surprised to see it in TK Maxx where I picked it up for a very reasonable £25 for 50ml.  It's clearly not a fragrance for everybody but as a tea enthusiast I'm always keen to expand my tea fragrances and this one represents a distinct difference from the norm of cutting metallic, freshness coupled with citrus or fruit. This is more like a proper cup of tea with milk in(not too suggest it's creamy in anyway) blended with tobacco it's got a freshness but it has the signature 'challenging', offset, darkness of other releases like Timbuktu or Dzing! It's got the spicing of a chai tea, plenty of cinnamon which is spicy hot but not sweet, and clove representing an old cologne vibe. I'd say that there's vetiver in here and a leathery vibe but sort of clean in a traditional manly way like a knize Ten. To me the drydown is like a very old type of soap that you just don't get anymore and somehow is indicative of the 1960's (not like I was around then!)  It's like the kind of toiletries a really, manly man can admit to using. You know...not Dior or Chanel it's the sort of purely functional moisturizer made famous by Icelandic fishermen or something? (So it's totally okay to use and not gay!) Tea for Two is never going to appeal to everyone and I'm almost one of those people, despite buying this fragrance.

It is not really black tea, but it smells like a tea that I can't name it. Since I am a heavy tea drinker, I can pick up the tea note everytime I smell it. There are also spices where it doesn't dominate the fragrance but it is a nice touch. I also get some smoky vibe.

However, it is still a beautiful experience despite the inflated vanillin note in the base (it's not bad but it reminds me of many candy vanilla candles and scents). The fume opens with a gorgeous smoked tea and pepper mashed in with a dusty cinnamon and burning tobacco all accented by the unassuming yet pervasive smokiness of guaiac wood. These notes linger for a few hours while picking up a sweet ginger/bread note and the ever growing sweetness of vanillin contrasted with a soft, powdered honey and leather. The whole composition is laced with the smoked wood/tea accord which lasts throughout its 10 to 12 hour life. This is a beautiful and delightfully smoky scent that is sure to please the ladies and gents as it can easily play toward the sweet or the woody notes."", ""Tobacco Vanille's softer, more introverted friend. Tea for Two really is a gentler version of Tom Ford's Christmas party clove bombardment. Personally I have a bit of an aversion to the whole milky, chai tea and ginger vibe, but I can stomach this a lot more than Ford's hyped up powerhouse, most likely because the tobacco here is a thousand times more subdued. L'artisan Parfumeur is a classy house that seems to succeed in creating scents that are creative, wearable, and subtle. If it's loud you're looking for then these bottles are definitely not for you, as they often get slammed for longevity issues.

People can detect a faint whiff of tobacco and leather but it's very subtle. It seems to be there towards the end after all the sweet notes of ginger and honey. It make the fragrance very unisex because it is so leathery and a bit of a smoky tobacco which are scents in men's colognes. Guys and gals can totally wear this freely. This is also sweetened by vanilla but it's not a big player. This is a warm winter fragrance perfect for actually wearing while drinking coffee or tea on rainy days.

Accordingly, I don\'t have the automated ""this smells better or worse than"" response he has developed.  To me, Tea for Two is indeed quite short lived. But when I reapply after an hour, the second application seems to last much longer... I get few decent hours of performance then. About that performance, I loved the very fact that I could identify smoky tea... I found the whole thing to be really enjoyable. So - now that Colin has set the metric for me (my ""really enjoyable"" is his ""5/10""), I REALLY want to check out Gucci pour Homme II... Can\'t even begin to explain why I\'ve ignored it. (Note: Colin Maillard\'s review was not so positive - he rated GPHII as the scent this should have been - and in case you want to see it, Colin seems to have moved away from Fragrantica, but his review is still up on Base Notes).  UPDATE I: I just ordered GPH II UPDATE II - 2019: Tea for Two is now one of my favourite perfumes - it keeps giving and I keep taking.

I just got, from a lovely swap, another bottle, the newly released one. Making a comparison, the color is much more clear on this one, the other one is ambery. There is some richness and sweetness in the old version that you don\'t find here, but, overall, in my opinion, it has not been much reformulated but rather watered down. It is simply a more transparent version of what it used to be, nevertheless beautiful and enjoyable. I will use both as they are gorgeous. This is just a little lighter than it used to be, in the same spirit.

Perfect for rainy days, and those occasions that call for a fragrance that doesn't impose.  Notes-wise, this is a stepped composition: it moves through its notes in a deliberate stages beginning with a dark, smoked tea with a leathery background, then vanilla and spices, before moving onto saliva-ish honey and tobacco base (a lot like the final dry down of Comme des Garcons Original). It is interesting, elegant and comfortable all at once. An absolute delight."", 'i like it, in my skin smell black tea', 'I got a bottle of this perfume from my lover for christmas. First it was too stingy for me but after a couple of tries I fell in love with this.  It\'s definitely a winter scent. I couldn\'t imagine wearing this in the summer. I love wearing this and warming up the house with fire. The warm tea scent goes well with smoke. It\'s not a sexy smell but somehow still sensual. It makes me feel very cosy.

For Little Edie this perfume probably would have not been eccentric enough.', ""This starts as a strong cinnamon aroma but quickly settles into a beautiful comfort scent of gingerbread and earl grey tea.

It does not really evolve much over the hours and this is one of the parts I don't enjoy as much. I would have liked it to be richer. It's my comforting, wintery, Christmas scent. It's very, very discreet (i.e. very low sillage) but I can smell it on me for hours. Would I buy it now? No, there are other scents with the same vibe that I prefer.

The wooden and ceramic roofed Tea Room we escaped to, to get out of the rain was ancient and covered with an abundency of moss and lichen as to appear mostly green and ghost-like. Since a koi pond surrounded the structure, you had to maneuver over some pretty slippery stones to get inside. Once in we were welcomed with strong steamy black tea scented with orange honey and spice. They served these little green ""shortbread"" like cakes made out of green beans and sugar. This fragrance brings this memory back to life for me. Tea for Two is at first smoky or ashy; not unlike a freshly lit cigarette. This stage doesn\'t last too long for me, but I do enjoy it.

I don't get tea, mostly tobacco and honey, but it's a neat one to have in my collection. I will wear this when I don my Dr. Marten boots and velvet leggings. It is unexpected from me and I'm sure to get some mileage out of this cult classic!!"", ""Here I am.

I am in love. It took years of smelling roughly 2.5K of perfumes for me to understand that my nose LOVES tea. Loves black, red, green, dark, smokey, spicy, white tea. I didn't even consider it a risk, to buy it blind, not even for a second. It's Tea for Two for sure - me and my boyfriend can enjoy it equally. Completely unisex. It's dry tobacco, dry, black tea and spices. No milk, no sugar, but a posh gingerbread biscuit by the side. It has a slight resemblance to Volutes by Diptyque, in terms of honey and tobacco/spices (minus the iris). Lasts for 4-5 hours, gets sweeter towards the end. I would imagine it's great for layering with milky/vanilla scents, too, perfect for fall/winter.

If you like tea and spices (and aren't into mainstream sweetness) - you cannot go wrong with this beauty."", ""Honestly... because of the hype that I've been seeing specially the reviews written everywhere about this fragrance here & Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille i felt like these are going to be something beyond imagination! When i tried it today morning from a sample i bought few days back ..... well... really!? this could be a signature! or even a favorite!? i mean it's a good blend balanced i can't deny but it doesn't deserve that huge hype that I've been seeing everywhere! in short, the juice presents a cinnamon tea essence sweetened with honey wax, and as it cools down the anise, & vanilla cake shows up a bit to sweeten the essence more! nothing more and nothing less!"", 'I thought that I would really enjoy wearing this scent. However from wearing in once there is nothing really amazing about it in my opinion. It smells great on paper but on my skin it is nothing amazing. The tea and honey work well with the spices.

TF2 is comfortingly familiar, yet not so literal as to be a novelty scent like a Demeter. I'm also very impressed that Ms. Giacobetti managed to create a tea scent that has some staying power to it; Bvlgari Black is the only other tea that manages to last more than a couple hours on me. I have a feeling this is going to be as close to a signature scent as any could ever be."", 'I bought it some time ago and it took me several applications to appreciate this beauty. The tabacco is really intensive in the opening. Star anise, green tea and spices with tabacco. Hopefully it is not a cigarette smoke which I cannot stand but more fresh tabacco smell. Tabacco still persists in the middle notes but is overwritten by aromatic sweet (honey) good black tea with ginger and spices. I adore this scent. There is something intriguing and so cozy and attractive in the smell. I think it can easily be used in aromatherapy for calming a spirit. It\'s a kind of sent to be used for all seasons. P.S. I used lot of time the word ""Tabacco"" but I\'m non-smoker :)', 'Thom Ford ""Tobacco Cinnamonne"", perhaps? :P lol!! Seriously, It\'s sorta-kinda like TV, but swap the \'vanille\' for cinnamon and there you have it! Joking aside, this is a very nice fragrance. Reminds me of smelling a bag of Earl Grey tea but with cinnamon, and someone nearby broke a fresh cigar in half that i can also smell. VERY nice. For me, the cinnamon kills it. Cinnamon is a scent that, for me, never totally goes away. As far as any smokiness, IMO that\'s via the leather; often times in a fragrance leather notes will seem smoky, I feel that\'s the case here. Any tobacco I am picking up seems fresh, cigar-like and unsmoked. Like a tobacco tea, if there were such a thing. ..? 7/10, glad I tried it, i still enjoy it despite the overbearing cinnamon.', ""Oh wow! This is an absolute gem of a fragrance and unlike anything I've ever smelt or owned before. I had this on my wish list for months but never found it in a store to try so, eventually, when I saw it for a good price on eBay I took the plunge and blind bought. It arrived today and oh. my. goodness! What a beauty. It opens, as you'd expect with a straight up, fragrant tea note, beautiful, but it's the heart that develops 10-20 minutes later that I simply can't get enough of. This perfume smells like Christmas! Cinamonny, gingerbready, warm, woody, honey - oh it's just delicious and not in an obvious vanillery (I'm using loads of non-existent adjectives here I know) gourmand way but in a cosy, could just bathe in this way. Then, about an hour later its a soft, honey-wood base that is trans-seasonal, perfect for anyone, non-offensive and utterly beautiful. This could never be headachey or nauseating, it is, in my humble opinion, a masterpiece of perfumery and now I understand the hype :)"", 'Admittedly I am not a big tea drinker. But for what its worth I think the name is at least to me slightly misleading. Compared to something like gucci pour homme ii, at least which is a much more sorta to me at least classic tea in a bag kinda smell that lasts a good bit. The tea vibe in this doesnt last for very long, and its a much more spicy diverse sorta chai perhaps even tea. Anyway at the top there is a definite tea smell to me, and its green. The greenness of this goes away quickly and the tea as the fragrance goes on also goes away not long after. The first part of the fragrance is pretty woody, and some smokey nuisances, with the spiciness and the sweetness in the background. As the fragrance dries down the the smokey and wood factor leave and you have just a really great mix of sweet and spicy notes. Doesnt really remind me of tea anymore but man I dont care, I think it smells great really cozy nice scent. Again perhaps misleading name to me. At least I was expecting a much more classic sorta tea smell at least from the name. But at the end of the day I suppose the smell is the most important thing, and this smells good. Its funny in a way because as I said I think the fragrance gets better as it goes on, and at the beginning is when there is the most tea for me. Go figure.  Performance was just ok.', ""As soon as I heard this was relaunched, I ordered it blindly. It is just as wonderful as I had hoped! I can't compare to the first release, but the current Tea For Two is plenty strong, not watered down, so I would like to think it smells the same as ever. It is just as one could ever hope for based on the description and the notes--very smoky black tea (like Russian tea) coupled with hot, peppery ginger and cinnamon.

For me, the magic is the leather, tobacco, and smoke. On me, there is no ashtray note—as far as I can tell, leastwise—and the tea and spices merely enhance the overall experience, bringing a little complexity and playfulness to it. Some have described this as a cozy, blanket-and-tea wintry night scent, but for me it seems suited to any time and occasion with the possible exception of the most humid summer heat. GPHII is not a bad comparison, but where it lingers in the playful sweet spiciness, TFT is all about depth and that powerful smokiness. I’m forever grateful for its triumphant return—snatched up two bottles as soon as I heard the news.', ""Again, L'Artisan has brewed together what is an absolutely magical, iconic, shimmering fragrance. This is a warm spicy to be sure, however honeyed superbly, skilfully, with a bright, happy dare I say cherry-cola note that is wonderful: a soda note might make it sound cheap, but no no no - the execution of that, however much it may not be deliberate, is stunning. It is glimmering golden mist, a settling warm, spicy, utterly artistic and sensual collaboration of notes. The sillage is fair - hanging around the wearer in a subtle yet enticing aura. It's perfect for day or night too. This is probably one of my favourites of the house - up there with M & M Extreme and Premier Figuier. EDIT: I wore this out this afternoon/this evening, and I kept getting drifts of this perfect, cosy, sensual, yummy smell. It sweetens considerably and wow... just love it! Well worth the investment."", 'This has a light airy quality and a piquant sweetness that has much in common with other spicy cinnamon fragrances, like ""Spicebomb"" and ""Gucci Pour Homme II"". For me tobacco and cinnamon are the strongest notes, while a pleasant green tea cuts through the sweetness to keep things fresh and alive. I get faint globules of honey too, but not has heavy or rich as the honey in ""Back to Black"" by Kilian, which has a very similar composition. Very comforting and wearable scent, perfect for spring/Autumn, and perhaps leaning more towards the feminine side.', ""It's a heavy, thick and dark tea scent... It resembles tobacco a bit, but it is really the scent of Lapsang Souchong tea. A very rich composition, it's dark and heavy without ever getting lighter. it smells bitter, warm, unforgivenly audacius. No wonder it is famous. Do not blind buy this, it's not for everyone, but a must for tea lover. If you are searching for matcha (japanese green tea) fragrance, you may want to check out Margiela's Tea Escape or Satori's Oribe, if you like ceylon tea try Atelier Cologne's Philtree Ceylan (FYI, Oolong Infini is an utter disappointment), if you feel like a English breakfast tea with flower addition, try Equinox Bloom from Penhaligon's, and if you love tea fusion, try Zoologist's Panda."", ""Here I am.

Fast forward, after searching for it for a long time, I finally found it in Dubai, Dubai Mall to be exact. Man... It was my lucky day or what?! And to top it up, it was discounted too, definitely one of the best days in my life.

Overall it feels like a warm cup of lapsang & earl grey tea with a side of gingerbread on a cold autumn day. I am very skeptical of honey in perfumes, since it often has that cloying synthetic honey note that makes me sick to my stomach, but this one is soft and mixes very well with everything else. It wears very close to the skin, but that's not a problem for me. Longevity is great. When my sample runs out I will definitely buy a full bottle 😊"", 'Oh, this is such a delightful gourmand to me. It smells just like a gingerbread house with a nice cup of earl grey tea. A little dry, a little spicy, just a hint of icing sugar. That\'s all I have to say. I find the silage and lasting power quite average. It\'s crisp and suitable for any time of the year, the spices are lovely ( mainly nutmeg and a little bit of cloves if you ask me, with a tiny dash of cardamon). There is something from the gingerbread here that smells toasty. I think it resembles a little Immoretelle from L\'occitane and Onde Mystere from Armani.  I find it definitely feminine, I don\'t see how a man could wear this, unless he wants to be attacked by hungry females. Edit: In warmer weather it does have an ""ashtray"" undertone.

My opinion did not truly change. I still find this not lily enough. Its a very aquatic green floral, albeit a good one. Aquatic florals can go shampoo like or laundry detergent-y, but this one doesnt. The lily note is mainly noticeable during the immediate spray, i get every aspect of a lily (headiness, warm spiciness, smokiness, waxiness) but then it removes the warm spiciness, smokiness and waxiness and makes way for freshness, fresh spiciness, cleanness and effervescence (NESS NESS NESS omg im sorry). What remains is a hint of headiness, which is buried under all the fresh and breezy notes. It just PAINS ME because i would expect a beautiful and full lily from a lily titled perfume sold by frederic malle. Like a carnal flower but instead of tuberose its lily centric. This doesnt do it. Its good as a fresh summery aquatic breezy scent, except its not ‘thin’ like most of other perfumes that fall into this category. Which is definitely a plus, and when i try to not look at this as a lily perfume, i truly dont think its that bad. But im not looking for this. At all… I love grand realistic animalic florals and this isnt that Its also a bit sharp to my nose. I know lilies have a metallic/mineralic aspect (something i dont personally pick up on while burying my nose in a lily and staining it with yellow), which may be enhanced by the salty/sea notes in this perfume. Once again not what i enjoy! Luckily its not coppery or blood like, its definitely more salty and cold.  It also has a hint of linden blossom for me, weirdly. Even though there are so many other florals listed. Theres a yellow nectary linden aspect to this, which i dont particularly enjoy. Im guessing its the lotus and freesia notes dewifying the pollen scent of lilies, creating a dewy yellow floral effect. This dewiness is also slightly reminiscent of baby wipes, something i never get when smelling good floral perfumes.  But all of these negatives are objectively a good thing, this perfume is surprisingly complex and reminiscent of a lot of things meaning that its not just a slop of different notes put together to sell something likeable. Good art is divisive after all, and i can recognize that even if i never want to partake in it ever again. In the end, this is a green breezy sharp watery mineralic summer floral. Dont blind buy if you are looking for lilies. Sadly i have not found a realistic lily perfume yet, and i would truly appreciate recommendations in messages. Like why can diptyque sell an ultrarealistic lily candle but perfumers cant create a realistic perfume? It cant be that hard… the closest ive gotten is l’air du temps which is drowned in carnation and anais anais which is drowned in hyacinth. I dont want a lily incense, and i dont want a fresh lily. I dont trust serge lutens blind buys, and i want it to be as full as possible. Not a thin feint lily but a true lily, a full lily Also, sidenote: why do all frederic malle perfumes have such boring base notes? Their perfumes always dry down into a clear boring husk of what they smelled like before. Ive has this experience with almost all of their perfumes, except for maybe portrait of a lady. For a house that is so adored by this community, you’d expect more effort put into drydowns, arguably one of the more important parts of perfumes (in my opinion). How wonderful is it when you have a perfume that takes you through a journey, instead of it immediately showing you its entirety and leaving you right after? Its like those people that overshare during initial conversations. Top note heavy perfumes always disappoint me in the long run, after spending a while wearing them you feel like you have smelled every aspect of them. Is it estee lauders fault? I didnt get to smell fm perfumes up until 2023… Idk. All of them are just musky woody EMPTY bases and the musks seem to be so sharp and screechy.

I just stayed an 1980s Icon along with the furious and vile perfumes, then launched. but what I smell here is surely that the LYS is not watered down, I smell it the endurence of which it attached to my pulsepoint. but I do smell rather the mechanics of aquatic, fruity and white musk notes. so all the flowers I can easily smell but they are in a dance in the Air or on the Coast. I don't smell Ocean Water, not Water, Air, or whatever lighthearted ingredients they have. I serve as a magnet for floral odors. I pick them out first and, prolongatedly so. so for me this is a LYS perfume but I would lie if I said I do not notice the Lighter Treatment it got. and I love the perfume. can you imagine that I smell only a subdued Tuberose and Ylang. that is also proof of the Light Touch. I just wanted to clarify what anosmias (citruses, aquatics, aerodynamics, ozonics, fresh notes [this is the term I must puke up on the most], white musks, aromachemicals), those I simply do not smell. nevertheless I smell the light touch and apparently there are just the good ingredients in the perfume. I bought a load of perfumes from 'Éditions de parfum. Frédéric Malle' around 2000. and all with precisely the right ingredients. they have weathered and wilthed, macerated and wined, inmidst my collection. the Lily is dancing with frivolités and frotteries. but she is persistant and the other flowers support her. this perfume is just good as it is. even if it has some inheritance of the 1990s."", 'I think this would be beautiful in the summer.

Not as rich and photorealistic a lily as Serge Lutens Un Lys, but a lighter and more polite scent.', ""neroli is apparently not on the notes list, but that's mainly what I smell. an abstraction of neroli? unfortunately, neroli always translates as a greasy, oily harsh smell on my skin. white flowers are apparent but I find myself getting exhausted to white flower frags (ESPECIALLY lotv and tuberose). this was a flop but it's not a bad perfume per se, just not good on me."", 'On the first spray, I actually got olive oil (!!!) blended with tuberose and maybe a touch of ginger. I do like this take on tuberose, it feels very appropriate for summer and has a clear storyline, like all of FM Fragrances. I believe the lotus, freesia and sea notes are the modifiers I’m sensing. That initial olive oil type scent I get feels very Mediterranean.  It’s not my favorite scent from the House so I probably won’t buy a FB but I do like it a lot and could see it growing on me.', 'Now this is just ok to my nose. Its a super fem lactonic, slightly salty white floral. White florals are king here, its all about white florals. Its almost like a coconut lotion with a white floral mix. Slightly reminds me of Carnal Flower, but this is more calm and easy breezy. Imagine drinking coconut milk, smelling a white floral bouquet, and sitting near pacific ocean.', 'Definitely pleasant to smell. Could be better IMO. Not a fan of the powdery scent. 7/10', ""Pleasant, powdery, floral, green, but didn't leave a strong impression on me. I don't find it special. I should test it again."", ""Dewy floral, green unripe charm. Salty, raw, somehow melancholic. The broken stem of a lily. A summer breeze drifting in through the open window of a seaside villa. A graceful woman with a swan-like neck.  On a less romantic note (but just as evocative, if you ask me) - Monica Bellucci in a white linen dress on a yacht. This is how someone recently described Lys Mediterranee to me, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since then. I'll try channeling this exact energy this summer. Hopefully it works - I'll report back."", 'I used to love wearing this Lily in the summer. And suddenly I realized that by some unknown reasons I never experimented with it in the cold. OK, here we go. Around 0 C, or 34-35 F today. That was a sad day for the perfume. In the summer it was my favorite perfume with the dominant lily note in it , so light, crispy , with a tiny pinch of salt in its aftertaste. And today it just shrank. It is a pretty powerful tuberose with some sparkles of white lilies next to it. It lost its sharp character and developed some unexpected sweetness deeply in the center. I am not a huge fan of tuberoses so it was not my piece of cake. But thank you for another interesting day.', ""finally got around to trying this. ummmm... its alright. definitely boring compared to carnal flower and iris poudre. Id say iris poudre has more photorealistic lily than lys mediterannee does.. So what do i not like about this perfume? first of all... the lily is so clean and so powdery that its barely a lily. it smells like a nuance of lily yes, but the indoles are missing and so is the spice. it smells like pollen/honey + baby powder. and one thing i hate is a cleaned up white floral. whats the use specifying the florals if they dont end up smelling ANYTHING like the flower? as a gardener this upsets me for some reason and i know it shouldnt. Taking liberties in art is what i stand for after all, and perfumery is an art. And yet, this just feels like it could be 'jasmin mediterannee' or 'chevrefeuille mediterannee' or 'tubereuse mediterannee' or 'fleur de oranger mediterannee' or 'fleur de tabac mediterannee'. catch my drift? theres nothing lily about this. theres tuberose and orange blossom listed to, but neither of them are distinct enough to be noticed. end result is just a baby oil like scent.  the other notes arent noticeable either. i was afraid this would be marine heavy but i dont even pick up on anything similar to sea breeze. angelica? nothing vegetal about this. lotus? nothing aquatic about this.  After this rant i can still say this perfume smells alright. its not horrible or gross or bad. Its nice actually. wearable, easy, but thats nothing like what real lilies smell like. Lilies are a challenge that some people cant complete and some complete with ease. this is accessible smelling and for the price of 300+ euros you'd expect any form or merit. Meanwhile this smells less expensive and wayyy less realistic than anais anais by cacharel (which isnt even lily dominant).  If u want real lilies, get iris poudre. yes its not a main player but its still extremely noticeable amidst the clash of warmth and cold. if u want realistic white florals, get carnal flower. no lily there but the sexual wilderness of indolic white flowers are captured really well there. And if u like something clean and simple, dont pay over 150 for a mid perfume"", 'Gorgeous photorealistic white florals. Breathable and spacious with a sense of sea air. It’s an uncomplicated fragrance but on a technical level this is a masterpiece.  Lys Mediterranee isn’t so much seeking to create something new as it is attempting to reproduce a place in time, standing near a body of water and breathing deep with your whole face stuck into a lily flower, the nearby orange blossoms mingling with the flowers aroma. It sings to the memory of those beautiful moments when you realize how all the disparate pieces of your life have added up to this particular present. It’s graceful, gracious, and knowing. Classy and smooth as ceramic.  It might not have the depth/grounding I crave in a fragrance for myself but I’d be hard pressed to find something unlikeable about the scent. If you’ve enjoyed ever enjoyed the scent of a vase full of flowers, you’ll likely enjoy this. Such an unbelievably faithful recreation.', ""Strong honeysuckle opening, like being in the freshest garden ever where the air is so pure and clean and crisp! Dries down to a kind of appley floral scent that is very nicely feminine, almost like a wedding fragrance. It's warm, musky, and salty in all of the right ways, making an incredibly balanced product that is sensual and natural that elevates a strongly feminine spirit. This is what your future wife smells like."", 'Opens with photorealistic lily and dew drops. Settles into a gorgeous creamy white floral scent (the tuberose gives it the creamy touch without overpowering the other notes). Stunning. Would buy', ""Lys Méditerranée by Frédéric Malle opens with an amazing salty breeze of lilies, capturing the true essence of the flower. However, the base notes quickly shift to an overpowering musk and vanilla, detracting from the initial allure. While the opening is captivating, the dry-down may disappoint. It’s tempting to reapply frequently to recapture that initial freshness, though this isn't the most practical solution."", 'Pull out all your samples and try them again☺️ At the first sniff i was real disappointed and repeled by this but decided to try it again and I want a bottle now . I’m back at my first trip to the ocean!! such fond memories and am now slightly obsessed with this one', ""Holy sweet magnolia! Is what I thought when I sprayed it. This stuff is strong. I realize now the floral is actually lily. I love aquatics and marine scents but I'm not getting a lot of that, maybe a tiny bit of something salty to balance out the sweetness and nothing musky or marine -- this is a very clean smell. Instead the aquatic goes towards creating a photorealistic sweet white floral that has powerful sillage. Three sprays and I was overwhelmed as if buried in a pile of petals, yet the realism makes it smell expensive. A bottle should last a while!"", 'I think the way people react to the scent of lily is similar to how people react to the taste of cilantro- you either love it or you despise it, there’s no in between. I for one have always loved both and when I can get them keep arrangements of fresh lilies in my home. To me, the scent is heavenly. But both my children complain they smell of hot dog water.  This perfume is a very faithful recreation of that lily scent, floated on a marine and salty background. It opens with a little spike of ginger that sets off the waxiness of the lilies perfectly. For about 3 hours it is intense and beautiful ( if you like lily), then it slowly fades away into a skin scent with a base of vanilla that doesn’t overpower the now lighter but still present lilies. This stage lasts a long time. I’m going to wear this in winter when nothing is blooming, I know it will take me instantly to a seaside cliff top surrounded by a field of blooming lilies.', 'It is nice, but the vanilla-musk dry down keeps it from being great. 7/10', 'I am In love with this perfuem the best flowery fragrance!!!', 'I\'m in white floral heaven. Elegant. Clean. Pure. Walking through a white flower garden with your lover on the coast of Maui. The smell of the sea crashing onto the black volcanic rock mixes into the hot summers air along with the pollen of the white florals of water lily, lotus, and orange blossom. Life is good. As soon as I sprayed this on I was transported to the coast and slapped in the face with a snap of ginger, a splash of ocean water, and a whole truckload of white florals. Wow. As it dries down it really begins to focus on every facet of a realistic water lily, from clean and green to thick and oceanic. While I do pick up some of the other listed notes here, mostly the orange blossom, angelica, and a hint of white musk, this is mainly focused on the lily, oceanic notes, and a bit of ginger to spice it up. Gorgeous.  Personally, white floral focused fragrances are usually not my cup of tea because they can come overly ""pretty"" and too feminine for my taste (but gender in perfume is also silly), but I am IN LOVE with this one. Super realisitic lily note, like you just pulled it out of the ground and muddled it between your fingers realistic, super intoxicating for me for spring to mid summer. Will get a larger decant of this asap to see if it\'s full bottle worthy, but my gut\'s telling me it might just be :) 9.6/10. Signature Scent Worthy. Song vibe - O\'Kailua by Nohelani Cypriano', 'It is a very well crafted fragrance and I understand all the love for it, but it is not exactly the one for me. On the initial spray, it is marvelous, fresh lilies on a sea shore, but then, to my nose, the lily becomes more a lily-of-the valley and lily-of-the-valley is not a favorite of mine when it is very prominent (I love the smell of the fresh flowers, but in fragrances is different).', ""A fragrance I would categorize as a work of art vs. something easily wearable. I went through a sample and enjoyed the experience because it's like a place in time more than anything else. It's hyper-realistic, smells like dirt, lilies, and ocean breeze. I appreciate the ginger in the opening. Reminds me of visiting Villa Jovis, an ancient villa overlooking the cliffs in Capri. I'm fascinated by this one but it requires a Neptune-influenced desire to be in your present life but straddling dimensions."", 'Very raw and ""real"" flower scent. Not a ""prettified"" flower smell.', 'I smell the waxy and somewhat pungent lily, I smell the salt...but this just is not pretty on my skin. It does not evoke the feeling of a Mediterranean sea breeze or anything like that. It lacks a certain light hand.', 'This is a real lily+lotus.. I tested this alongside Carnal Flower and I felt more attracted to LM. Why? It’s much more breathable, aromatic, and in the distance compared to CF. Don’t get me wrong though, CF feels like real tuberose, but I prefer my florals soft, dainty, but at the same time, long lasting. And to me, it sort of feels like standing on a bridge on top of a pond with lily pads and fireflies roaming around it, fresh dewy trees, butterflies dancing around the lotus and lilies, a quiet waterfall, and crisp breezes in the sunrise of early spring. It also feels realllyy calming, tranquil, crafted with lots of care and love, and just reminds me of being happy. Not so much putting my nose directly on a bouquet of tuberoses. I love both, but LM is more for me  ヽ(*´∀｀) 🦋', ""This fragrance reminds me of a weed lily (possibly a calla lily) we had growing in our garden growing up. It had thick, white petals with a rich waxiness to them.  The added sea notes add a bit of whimsy and freshness, like a beach-adjacent lily flower that has been picked by a child and discarded off a cliff into the ocean, getting caught by wind gusts along the way.  As someone who is ... lily-livered and oftentimes easily nauseated, the florals are a bit too pungent for me to wear this as an everyday scent. But on the days I'm feeling extravagant and craving a true white floral, it's an absolute delight."", '#560 in my ""Tour de Fragrance"" This is the fourth scent I\'ve tried from this house, always high quality, but pricey. This one is VERY floral, clearly more for the ladies, not unisex at all. Lily and Lotus are very dominant. It\'s a fragrance for women that like traditional feminine scents. Good projection and longevity. It\'s just not something I\'d buy for most of the women in my life, but I have noticed the late teens, college-age women I know are trending more floral in their tastes than women around 30, which is the age of most of my female friends. So maybe you buy this for your daughter who\'s a freshman at State.', ""Aquatics are not usually my thing because I DESPISE calone. Luckily, Lys Mediterranee is not aquatic in the calone-bomb way. Rather, It's a gorgeous saltwater lily that has delicacy to it without being dilute or weak. It is hard to capture true lily in a fragrance; since extract from real lillies isn't used in perfumery, it's always a manmade accord. On top of that, often when people speak of lily in perfume they are referring to lily of the valley aka muguet. So I love to encounter a realistic true lily scent, and better yet one from Frederic Malle! This isn't a sweet fragrance, necessarily, but there is a sort of candied quality to it that I think can be attributed to the orange blossom and the vanilla in the base. I was happy to find that Lys Mediterranee remains fresh, floral, and breezy into drydown, without giving way to just a boring run of the mill vanilla/musk combo. One of my very favorites from FM, and in general."", ""i love the sea water note in this, i just wish it wasn't so overpowering. the florals feel very secondary to it, i catch a whiff of lilies every now and then. it’s meant to evoke smelling lilies by the seaside, but for me it’s more like standing in the ocean and seeing lilies in the distance, thus remembering what they smell like against the backdrop of salt water. i don’t get ginger or vanilla at all. even so, it’s a very lovely and long-lasting summery scent, i would just need more from it to want to purchase a full bottle."", ""Staggeringly good gingery, salty lily. It seems delicate in the opening but it deceptively enveloping and intoxicating. This perfume is pure class, perhaps a but too classy for me, but I'm glad I have a bottle. It's in my top five Malle fragrances. Performance is relentless."", 'Photorealistic dominant Lily that’s versatile and unisex. Very comfortable and well mannered. There are hints of a sea breeze, but it’s a gentle support, and not one of those calone freight trains (thankfully).  I got great longevity and enjoyed the nice scent bubble. I sprayed once in my hair and my pillow ended up with lovely remnants for a couple days.', 'Pungent lilies and ginger. The aquatic notes are fleeting, mainly the essence of salt which disappears a few minutes in. On my skin it reads as a sweet and exceptionally spicy floral-oriental. I can appreciate it; it is not bad, not great - a bit too dense and prickly to really enjoy it. For a true lily-based aquatic, sample Bond No. 9 Shelter Island.', 'Wish the opening would stay around longer. It’s like mint and basil tonic with some freshly cut florals floating in the water. Then it starts to smell like old flowers and blocks of ginger and became pretty feminine and pungent', ""Lys Mediterranee is a stunner for me! One of my favorite scents for summer. The scent bubble that develops around you is completely stunning and intoxicating. Such a classy scent without veering into the direction of 'old fashioned'. I get the similarities to House of BO LA Mar, but I think Lys Mediterranee is much better. I used to love La Mar, but there's a sour note (olibanum) that ruins it for me. Lys Mediterranee is so smooth, my nose does not find her screechy one bit. She has the same vibe as Capeline (another favorite of mine), but I don't find them to be all that similar; both uniquely beautiful fragrances. Summer masterpiece."", ""This is a very realistic Lily fragrance, you can smell the stems and the petals as if you had the flower in you hand. It feels like being in a lily flower field and getting all the natural aromas. It is a very beautiful fragrance, I don't feel it represents me, but I would certainly enjoy smelling it on someone else of the type. Leans quite femenin by the way, in my personal opinion. Great projection and durability at least 6 hours, I fell asleep and didn't quite know how many hours it lasted."", 'Freshly Plucked Lilies..Bottled. From the very start, the fresh lightly sweet, white floral smell of lilies dominates. Feels and smells wet, as if the picked lily is still heavy with raindrops. Fresh, white floral, lightly spicy, slightly sweet. The most photorealistic scent of lilies. Every other note exists to shape and trim the edges of the main note, the lilies, into a vivid true-to-life one. Yes, you can pick hints of ginger and lotus if you try but the big picture is one beautifully-wrapped bouquet of lilies. This is such a straightforward scent but it will be adored by those who love the smell of lilies. A tenderly feminine, neutral weather wear. ""Love""!', 'I LOVE the ginger note in this, it works so beautifully with the white lily! I just wish the ""sea water"" didn\'t become as pronounced as quickly as it does. The notes pyramid lists sea water in the top notes, but the pyramid has to be reversed or something. As it is first sprayed it\'s full on, powerful white lilies with a warm touch of spicy ginger and clementine.  However, to soon for my liking, the lotus and sea water start to dominate. It starts off as a warm spring evening with the last rays of sun casting everything in a red glow, but then transforms into a pink waterlily on a rainy summer lake. It still smells lovely later on, just not as divine and gorgeous as that warm lily + ginger combo from the beginning.  If you know what the plant Stephanotis floribunda/waxflower smells like it smells very similar to this perfumes top notes.  This is probably my favorite from Malle at the moment, at least as long as the top notes stay around.  It\'s a shame that it has to change so dramatically in the dry down though, as is the same with at least some others from this line too, unfortunately. En passant for example, starts off as the most gorgeous, photorealistic lilac, bordering on indolic, but then quickly starts smelling like a sharp, watery hairspray thanks to the water notes and cucumber.  Later on it even starts smelling like a rotting wase of lilacs, due to the cucumber + yeasty notes...  Similar story with Une Rose/Rose Tonnerre as well.  Starts off as a perfect and magical, dark red rose, but to soon it turns into a thin, and weirdly synthetic, musky mess.  Such a shame, and a huge let down when a fragrance that starts off as a clear 10, devolves into a 5 or a 4 by the time it hits the middle notes.  And this brand isn\'t exactly cheap either...', '@TheSniffer - I actually came here to update my review. As I had hoped, giving my nose a rest from lily, and waiting for it to settle down, has made a huge difference. Whereas before I was just barely getting the smallest whiff of lily, I can now smell it as it develops. People have described it as linear, but I notice the changes between notes and accords more easily now and the longevity is decent. I definitely get more green this time around, and I finally understand what ""water"" smells like! LOL!  So at least in this instance, I\'m 99.9% sure my bottle is legit. The fact that the 2 other Malle\'s I own behaved the same encouraged me to wait, and it was worth it. This is the type of perfume I know I will crave quite a bit throughout the year! Thank you for taking the time and sharing with we me what you\'ve learned!', ""I'm panicking a little because I just received my bottle and I'm having a hard time smelling anything. Granted, I may have some nose fatigue because I have been on a lily spree lately, and I also need to give it time to settle, but I purchased it on eBay from a verified sender. Still, who knows if it's a fake? It looks genuine, but I suppose I will have to see what it's like in a week or so, maybe longer. I have very high hopes that this will be the lily of my dreams. I will do a proper review after it has rested. Fingers crossed! EDIT - 5/22/23. Two days later and I'm happy to report that it's starting to show signs of life!! I am getting the lily above all else right now, no watery or saltiness, though as it continues to macerate, I am certain that other notes will assert themselves. Or maybe not. Maybe it's just so well blended that it comes together to form one, intoxicating lily. I could swear that there is some ylang in here, just a drop, that adds a smoothness to what can frequently be a shrill note. Whatever it is, it prevents the lily from becoming piercing or soapy. The odd thing about this is that while I can definitely smell it around me, it's a different story when I sniff my wrist. What surrounds me is ethereal and gorgeous. I get a similar effect with Malle's Lipstick Rose. It's as if the require the air in order to fully develop. I think I can safely say that this is a love and one of the greatest lily perfumes ever created. The longevity isn't the greatest, but these days, that seems more like the rule than the exception."", ""This is such a beautiful and naturalistic perfume that does exactly what it says on the box! It's a lovely and light as well as slightly aquatic ginger lily perfume that is a bit green and salty and makes one think of the beach. The seagulls pass by and you sniff these lillies on the beach while the salty air also wafts through your nostrils while you're wearing a white bikini and a white linen dress. It's so naturalistic smelling, which is what I like in fragrances. It's a very feminine and white floral perfume too that is very calming and serene and also isn't indolic smelling. It smells like a summer vacation! I could imagine being in Rhode Island in the United States, Greece or Cyprus during the summer wearing this. I can smell the sea salt and the slightly spicy ginger at the top, which gives this perfume a light and fresh character that goes through the whole life of this fragrance. I can then smell all of the notes listed here in the heart notes, but the lily note is the strongest of course, followed by the orange blossom. I can then smell hints of the green and rooty angelica and the aquatic lotus. Finally, I can smell some musk at the base. I can't really smell the vanilla in the base though. Both sillage and projection are moderate on me, with this fragrance lasting 6 hours in total on my skin before dissipating completely. It's a perfume that's unusually both inoffensive and unique smelling, so you can definitely both wear this at work and not smell like everyone else with their La Vie Est Belle, My Way and Coco Mademoiselle's. I think that you could wear this during the evening too, making it a very versatile fragrance. I adore this perfume and I would give it an 8/10 in total for how good I think it is. Two thumbs up from me! 👍👍"", 'The opening is stunning, like a real, living lily, but after that, the middle and base smell of ginger flakes...', ""Opens as a soft white floral.

Not a huge fan."", 'What a wickedly realistic lily. The aquatic notes and angelica are the perfect compliment to lily. They keep if fresh and prevent any ""shrieky"" quality from happening (sometimes that\'s a problem with lily scents). This gives me happy memories of Easter when I was a child.

This is so clean and watery and green it\'ll have the people in your vicinity looking around for a live plant.', 'This is such a realistic Lily fragrance. Like sitting in a field of lillies by the ocean. The marine aspect is a mere compliment giving an airy quality, and I wouldn’t classify this as a marine scent. This is not a screechy perfume, but settles quickly into a smooth fragrance that creates a close scent bubble. I guess a great alternative to your typical white floral fragrance done in a very elegant and sophisticated way.

I originally fell in love with Lucky because it is a masculine, long-lasting, salty aquatic scent cleverly disguised as an innocent lily-of-the-valley. However, it\'s (intentionally?) synthetic quality has started to grate on me.  I bought a 3.5ML sample Lys Mediterranee as a possible replacement. Unfortunately, I feel it suffers from the same ""synthetic"" screechy quality as Lucky. They are in fact VERY similar scents, though Lys Mediterranee is much sweeter, and therefore much more cloying to my nose. I find the vanilla in Lys Mediterranee quite powerful from start to end, whereas Lucky is more ozonic/metallic. They both have a salty quality.  On a positive note, Lys and Lucky are both remarkably long-lasting scents. Good projection on both. Both are summer appropriate, but I think Lucky is better for really HOT weather, and Lys more wearable when it\'s cool. 2.5/5', 'This is so delicate and innocent.', 'A hyperrealistic lily scent - so fresh and clean.

I do NOT care about ""tea"" perfumes and not a single one I\'ve tried has really come close to the smell of true tea. I also assume that tea notes in perfumes aren\'t meant to smell like real tea, but like an artistic impression of ""green"" tea, which is why there\'s no tea notes listed for this one anywhere. The reason why I\'m so in love with it is because it has a REALISTIC OOLONG TEA SMELL.  I\'m talking unflavored chinese C. sinensis, gong-fu style, resteeped many times until the flavor disappears. The beauty of this particular style of consumption is that the flavor and aroma of tea develops with every successive steep, just like perfumes have their openings, heart and the drydown. Of course, there are many categories of tea, countless varieties and styles among those varieties.  The body of this specific perfume, half an hour after spraying, smells exactly like wet leaves in a gaiwan after the third steep of a very high quality, modern style Tie Guan Yin. There\'s still the natural floral aroma (lilies, lilac, hyacinth) of the unoxidized (modern style!) TGY, but also the green, grassy and a little bit vegetal background of well....wet tea leaves.

There was a note so sharp it pierced my nostrils. Anyway the notes following that, the lily and the lotus, are so strong it gave me a headache. Lovely though the perfume maybe, headache inducing is surely a cause for me to balk. I will probably leave it around for a while before trying it again.', 'Such a beautiful lily scent, too bad it’s been weakened thru reformulation, that it doesn’t even last an hour on me. Oh but it’s worth buying if only for the beautiful scent it is if only for an hour. Great perfume to wear to Church or on a date, I wear it also to bed. Beautiful scent. If it lasted just a few hours longer, as it used to, I’d buy back up bottles. But as it is, when my bottle is used up, I won’t repurchase. Malle has weakened all of their perfumes. Greed once again has reared its ugly head …..how sad. Malle has some of the most beautiful and masterpiece fragrances. Not anymore.', ""I wonder whether the incredible Edouard Flechier intended to create a perfume that featured the lily note as a soliflore, and whether the addition of everything else (i.e. sea water, by the beach etc.) is the marketing team on overdrive? I don't smell any sea water and I wouldn't know what that is supposed to smell like in a perfume either. I imagine what a person smells when they are walking by the beach is iodine. This is a superb soliflore. Why isn't this enough? Why does it have to have an added angle? (Those are questions for the marketing team) To me, this smells like easter lily, i.e. the type of lily the grows during Easter mainly in countries around the Med. Given that typically this is in mid-spring, it is too cold for anyone local to go to the beach just yet. And in any case lilies don't grow too close to the seaside.  Like I said, a great soliflore, and it is indolic, which is a plus."", 'This is such an underrated fragrance from this house. No one ever speaks of this but it’s so pretty. Definitely unisex for this time of year. This to me is a very wet and true lily. Very green, a lily that just has been picked. Also reminds me of a flower shop when you stick your head in refrigerator where all the flowers are stored. Perfect for spring and summer. Longevity is a home run lasts forever, I can still smell it on my clothes the next day and with no drydown the same strength it had when you first sprayed this on! Sillage surrounds you and is definitely gonna get you compliments. I have a the biggest size bottle and so happy that this is in my collection. Highly recommended 10/10', 'Very strongly floral, I agree that it has a honeysuckle scent, more so than lily; it’s more like a lily of the valley than lily. The ginger makes it warm rather than cool, and gives a bit of a soft spicy feel, but isn’t too strong.  Sadly I only get the fresh, aquatic note for a minute at the start, and it’s quickly overwhelmed by the floral and ginger. However a salty note does remain throughout, must be the ‘seawater’.  And of course a whole load of musk in the base.  As it dries it gets saltier, maybe too salty. Like a very salty honeysuckle.  Nice overall, but I don’t need to own a full bottle.', 'Gorgeous, well blended aquatic lily', ""Lily or Honeysuckle? This scent is the most photorealistic honeysuckle scent I've ever smelled. I've smelled Lily alone and, I can smell those aspects in this perfume. However, the entire scent invokes memories of my mother and me eating honeysuckle from the gates of our neighbors' houses during honeysuckle season. The aquatic aspects of this perfume remind me of the honeysuckle nectar and, I believe the angelica emerges as this broken stem-Esque smell. I have been enjoying the Frederic Malle scents I've smelt so far. This fragrance is aquatic, green, musky, floral. I like this a lot and plan to spend more time with my sample to determine if I should purchase a full-sized bottle."", 'One of the original Malles when he launched. I got it on my very first trip to Paris. Twenty plus years later and it’s still a captivating scent, full of life and freshness. A transportive fragrance, it takes you straight to the Mediterranean coast. It’s a very green, vibrant lily, with the pollen and the ocean breeze intermingled. I’m reminded of the scent when you bury your face in a lily and you just get a hit of that polleny freshness. I love it, it’s one of the fragrances I will always have on hand. It’s bright and alive, a little peppery and makes you perk up. I don’t think anyone would smell this and say it’s anything but beautiful. It also projects really well and stands out from the crowd of spring scents with a lot of personality.', 'Lys Mediterranée is aptly named - it is first and foremost a lily scent, bolstered by watery, aquatic notes reminiscent of a sea breeze. It is of a high quality and is well-blended. The lily at the heart of this fragrance is lush and photorealistic - waxy, smooth and slightly sweet. While I love lilies, I associate them primarily with funerals, and I expected an unavoidable funereal quality to this scent. However, I am pleasantly surprised. The inspired blend of notes shows lily in a new light, evoking the image of white lilies growing in a garden by the coast.  LM opens with a vivid lily note - rich and polleny, resembling the real thing. It is quickly joined by fresh aquatic notes and the salty ""sea breeze"" accord, which breathe life into the lily (as opposed to funereal death). It is an ingenious way to present lily in a fragrance. There is no perceptible ginger to my nose. The soft vanilla in the base enhances the sweetness of the lily, and other white florals creep in as it develops - they are hard to distinguish, as it is so well-blended, but the lily is not solely a lily at this stage. Clean musk emerges as it dries down, fading to a musky skin scent with a whisper of white flowers.  Sillage and longevity are moderate, it is a fairly subtle scent overall. Feminine and elegant, LM is ideal for springtime day wear. Simple but beautifully executed, this is one of the best lily scents I\'ve tried. 4/5.', ""This is a beautiful composition. Photorealistic lily, the lily that is so authentic you feel the spice of it, it has a taste to it that sits on your tongue. I don't know how this fragrance always ends up in my mouth but every time I spray it on, even down to my knee caps, I can taste the sweetness of the lily like I'm eating it. The sharpness of the sweet lily is there, and it's hot and even bitter at times. Not a fresh smell by any means but more salty and sweet. I love Lys simply for how transporting it is. It is EVOCATIVE. I immediately see myself walking along the precipitous coastline of the Mediterranean, where I've never been, under the hot sun. And around me are bushes of flowers, their petals fluttering in the wind and the scent wafting through the heat carried by the salty breeze of the ocean. The coastline is dry otherwise, almost desert-like. I get this feeling because there is no greenery to this fragrance like I find with so many other FM scents. It's hot and exquisite and balmy, and that's where I think people find it cloying. It isn't cut with anything-- there is nothing fresh to fight off the balminess except for the instinctive feeling that it SHOULD be fresh because you start to think it's a real lily, blossoming for you, and at some point it will come around and you'll forget you're wearing it until it wafts in again. This scent requires courage. I have to let it overtake me, otherwise I am fighting it. You have to become the lily almost-- like I'm drawn to wear a white wide-brimmed hat and a white dress and go out looking like a million bucks to be fit for this perfume. It is far too pretty to just wear however."", 'This smells like lily and the rind of a watermelon to me. Not sweet-but that watery, green, rawness of watermelon rind. It almost smells earthy to my nose, that must be the sea water note? Reminds me of that blue bubblegum ice cream I was obsessed with as a kid. Overall, it wasn’t what I was expecting so my review probably isn’t super fair, I don’t love it though.', 'Has a very natural and realistic lily note. However the aquatic aspect kills this fragrance for me. Not for me.', ""A hallmark of a good eau de perfum for me is if I am able to spray it in the morning on my hoodie, and still smell it just as well in the evening when I take my clothes off before bed. This fragrance isn't a powerhouse, in fact it's actually more of an intimate skin scent, but it does have the ultimate longevity I crave. I tried Regime des Fleurs Leis earlier in the summer, which has very similar notes. Lys Mediterranee is much deeper and more sumptuous. The musky vanilla dry down is very comforting, and I might carry it into fall for this reason, but the aquatic salty notes do stick around on me. I used to be a devotee of Le Labo Lys 41, which I decided I would never go back to now that I have tried Leis Mediterranee. It's warm and feminine and maybe the white floral of my dreams."", ""I have to be in the mood to wear this. On vacation, outdoor party, good times. If I'm in a serious or bad mood, the fragrance's intended snapshot of a walk across a lily filled Mediterranean coast turns to a floral shop with vases of lilies and the florist cutting stems. Pleasant connotations. The smell of lotus in a humid hot house is also captured here."", 'Very fresh and aquatic. It reminds me of a garden in a cool morning after all night heavy rain. The flower in this perfume is very similar to fresh bud of Syzygium trees (clove, jamboo, rose apple, Indonesian Bayleaf, etc). Maybe it is what people here meant with clove smell. A very lovely, nostalgic, and edgy perfume', 'Thought i was onto a winner here the opening was lovely and original then an hour or so later i got tuberose and it made me feel a bit nauseous. By the end of the 4 hours of its life this had gone and i was left with a burnt ember kind of thing.', 'Lys Mediterranee is a unique and unusual aquatic floral fragrance that I don’t see many people talk about. It opens with a heady fleshy floral lily (Lys) accord that has a very natural feel to it. Lily (Lys) is very different from Lily of the Valley (Muguet), while LOTV has a sweet clean green floral scent, Lily (Lys) has spicy and green floral nuances and it almost has some phenolic characteristics due to the para-cresyl phenyl acetate. Fleur de Lalita from Dusita has a similar lily accord to the one present here. This lily accord is surprisingly paired with a salty aquatic accord that consists of calone among many other aromachemicals. This aquatic accord reminds me of the 90s aquatic fragrances and gives me a feeling of the sea breeze. There is a tiny touch of lotus but I couldn’t detect any angelica or orange blossom. The overall feeling that this fragrance evokes is as if you are visiting a florist near the sea where the scent from the flowers are mixed with the sea breeze.', 'This has recently become one of the fragrances I want the most. Not because of it being ground breaking, beastmode, or a compliment getter... But because it takes me back to the black top of my elementary school, of all things. At a gate on the very edge of the yard, there was honeysuckle that grew every spring that all of us kids would go and taste. This evokes that smell so vividly that I just had to have it. To remind me of a time in my life when I had no worries and was just... happy. edit: recently tried carnal flower which somehow evokes this memory even more vividly! i am thoroughly impressed', ""Revisiting Malle and as always stuff like this, en passant and eau de magnolia have this sense too as well as some I don't like as much like the Angelique one and L'eau d'Hiver is just conceptually superior (although seemingly simple) and perfectly executed. There's something very present about these Malle's they don't feel like they are respecting tradition but nor are they future facing trying to break new ground, or be the next trend. They are more accurately a moment, simply captured, and to me there's something comforting and liberating about them.  It's as if the perfumers were recreating the beautiful head-space of a flower, what I mean is that there's a sense of 'air' a feeling of atmosphere, space, whatever you want to call it.  Lys Mediteranee is carried to you upon the breeze, it's lovely.  Smells oceanic, the ginger listed here actually is just perceivable ever so slightly, as well as a green tint to the florals, which are both exotic and familiarly wafted from various summer blossoms.  I bought a small 10ml just to test the water, I see this as a functional, hot weather fragrance, to cool me off.  I'm always going on about how perfume should be complex and 'do' lots of stuff well these are the exceptions, they don't do much, they are not really multilayered experiences, but rather zen calm, aromatherapy which allows you to clear your head. In fact this scent would be ideal for meditation.  Despite all the praise it's far from my favourite Malle, but if you like lilies and florals in general this is so nice and light as a feather."", ""we are facing a masterpiece. it opens with a really sea breeze. but real, it doesn't even seem artificially created. melancholy, moving, sad and hopeful. a pure, clean green lily. I would wear it all year round. green. also racice smell. I have tears as I write about this perfume. I don't feel the orange blossom, musk, vanilla and ginger. 10/10 maybe it doesn't project very well ... but just go fast with the sprays. god bless edouard flèchier."", 'lovely this is a masterpiece with its simplicity. This is the scent that you smell once and will never forget! I should have bought the full 100ml bottle.', 'Lilies smell differently, white Casablanca lily smells sensual with hedione, pink Stargazer lily potent and peppery, and white Easter lily pure and very clean. Lilies are night fragrant flowers. I sincerely hope this would be only like Easter lily in a bottle, for it smells precious, heavenly and divine. But the name of this perfume in my place is translated to Ginger lily, another species of a plant easily seen here, making me wonder... Is this my holy Easter one?', ""Fallen in love with this one. The intense lilies are covered by the marine aroma leaving a fresh summer fragrance. Perhaps Frédéric Malle's marketing has put a spell on me, but I truly feel like the product description for this one is astutely evocative. The longevity on me is great, lasting all day and still being noticeable the morning after. I'm going to buy a bottle asap and make it my smell of the summer."", 'It smells like a bitter Chinese green tea i have.

I hated Carnal Flower, didn't really like a jasmine essential oil I purchased in a set of essential oils, and was thinking maybe white floral fragrances aren't for me... although I adore the scent of gardenias in real life.  Tested it on my skin today in honor of a peace lily I purchased, and I have to say I quite like it.  It's not as offensive as Carnal Flower, while seeming just as realistic. You get the flower, the pollen, and the stem.  With the other notes on my skin, it's softened. But lily remains the star of the show. I was thinking Eau De Magnolia would be my next buy but Lys Mediterranee is turning out to be a strong contender. EDIT: Great performance on this, for me. Lasts all day and projects for I believe 3-4 hours."", 'Opening is a photorealistic Mona Lisa lily, with the pollen and trimmed stem. This bears the strength of the actual flower which can fill a large room plus the hallway. With the clean marine and floral mix, I am transported to a light-filled and breezy seaside residence that features gauze and linen curtains instead of doors and windows. But for a city-person with less of an imagination, this might stir up the image of a Crabtree & Evelyn store. The dry down is green and relaxing. Better for breezy spring days in my opinion, warm weather can cause the lily to verge on the suffocating side.', 'Most realistic floral fragrance in Malle collection in my opinion (even more Carnal Flower, En Passant, Une Rose etc) . Feels like you smell the flower inside or enter the flower shop when you spray it. I have travel spray and whenever I wear it, people love it on me. My bestie once said I smell clean and beautiful when I wear lys mediterranee. Love it.', ""Another test in the search for a heady floral, this time branching out into lily.  The top note is pure florist and Sussex flower festival, dominated by the wave of lily, like opening a heavy oak door on a churchful of lilies. It's bracing.  The drydown is lovely, elegant, gentler, an elusive lily of the valley, with enough complexity to save it from being a straight and ultimately dull soliflore.  Impressed."", 'OK fragrance.

Potency and staying power are impressive. I'm not getting the aquatic notes at all- just full-bodied lilies at the peak of their blooming season. If you're headache prone, proceed with caution- this is heady stuff and a little goes a long way~ This is the Casablanca lily that I had hoped Donna Karan Gold would be-"", ""I have a large complete collection, I try not to add to.

Marine notes are often synthetic and poorly done, as is the case here. This is a looser for me. Im a guy, and I dont go for girly florals. Frags like Fleur Cassie or Tom Ford Champaca are wonderful.

At first spray very green, botanical, fresh, after some time a bit of flowery sweetness comes in, mixed with gingery naunces and noticable saltiness. In a drydown, musky undertones and just a touch of vanilla make sensual impression. I wouldn' t consider this fragrance aquatic-this aspect is indeed in the background. What I like is that it smells of natural flower in optimum intesity-not too heady, but not shy, either. Texture is creamy, silky, rounded with a dash of powder. Colours: green, white, golden. Even though it's close to nature experience, there are more than enough elements that keep it parfumy fragrance. Very elegant. It has similarity with Carnal flower in terms of overall feeling, but this one matches my taste more. Instant love."", 'LY MEDITERRANEE smell exactly like the fresh white casa blanca lily. If you do 4 sprays you will get a big bouquet of lilies and stay soft and spicy until the dry down. It lasted for 2 hours on my extra dry skin and 6 hours on my cloth.Though, I prefer the lily in Cartier Baiser Vole which the dry down was more creamy and slightly sweeten. Baiser Vole also last 2 weeks on my shirt, project more and cost a lot less. The 3 Baiser Vole bottles I got was from 2014 so I am not sure if it was reformulated now to compare to the recent Ly MEDITERRANEE. Both of these perfume are the best lily interpretation. Highly recommended.', 'Lovely, very realistic floral with great longevity. Will last all day. Projection is moderate, but you won’t forget you are wearing it. I love the smell it leaves on my shirts after wearing it, which will last for days. You will keep going back to your closet to sniff your collar, just because :-) P.S. I must strongly disagree with afterdark’s review (further down the page) that Lys Mediterranee is in no way a unisex scent. I am male and I love wearing it. For the record, I also wear Carnal Flower. It’s a total myth that men cannot wear florals. A confident man will wear a floral that suits him and smell fantastic.', ""Creamy, lush sunny skin scent with very green and floral notes. I adore it. Not too overpowering like some white florals, you can really live in it, and feel like yourself. I definitely wear this perfume when I don't have a specific mood, or event to go to. It's a great all rounder."", ""This isn't 'icy' IMO. I find it green and lily at the beginning, but dries down to a rather heavy lily scent with some salty touches. Dense. White. Almost indolic. It's great for people who like lily, but it's not something I would buy due to my difficulty with white florals."", 'Reformulated. Another mangled masterpiece. Now it smells like melon water. Pity!!!', ""The loveliest (green) lily of them all: green, crisp, refreshing yet rich, dense with glorious gingery zing and the tang of sea salt. Only just enough vanilla, blossom and musk to keep it alive, rather than to over-sweeten the whole effect. Searching for my platonic ideal of a lily scent, the closest I've ever come is Lutens' amazing Un Lys, but that is a much warmer, spicier, and more feminine species than this one. Yet Lys Mediterranee seems a bit more manageable and wearable, less of a total lily-diva like Un Lys. Moreover, it is beautifully balanced and smells of real nature, not a perfumers' shop; despite the lily-of-the-valley and the angelica, it never ends up reminding you of soap. (Some people pointed me at Cartier Baiser Vole when I mentioned I was hot on the trail of lilies, but they were wrong: the absolute overdose of sweetness and vanilla in that one turned me right off.) It's perhaps closer to Tom Ford Lys Fume, but with a much more outdoorsy and botanical feel, without the sweet spiciness of LF.  In visual flower terms - aptly enough - Un Lys would be a giant theatre-presentation bouquet of overpoweringly heady Oriental lilies, congratulating you on a big public achievement; Lys Fume would be a smaller, intimate bunch of really sexy stargazers, presented just for you by someone who cares; and Lys Mediterranee would be three or four stalks of the most perfect, immaculate, white Madonna or Easter lilies, perfuming the calmest, cleanest bit of your home space with their glorious aroma. The set-up that makes you feel cool, calm and collected. Lys Med is quieter, but simply has all I need: beauty of both hot and almost-icy kinds, a bouncily assertive sillage and well-rooted longevity (up to 7-8h even on skin, beyond on clothes, which counts as an entire season on my skin which drinks perfume), and most important of all - it just makes me sigh with pleasure whenever I put it on. One to keep smelling yourself for, chasing the after-shudders of beauty which will keep unfolding all day. I'm unlikely to end up on a millionaire's yacht on the Med in summer any time this lifetime, or probably in any other - but if it ever happened, I'd always hope that I managed to be scented with Lys Mediterranee. Just absolutely beautiful."", 'Not sure about the beginning, but after a time it’s truly lovely.  I was so surprised not to find tuberose in the perfume pyramid – among the middle or base notes. To me, this smells very much like a lighter tuberose than say Carnal Flower, also from Frederic Malle. Now, I’m no authority on tuberose, but I really thought it was not only there, but dominating the overall impression. Does anybody else get tuberose from this lovely fragrance?  Edit: Well, the next time I tried it, it was all lily of the valley and only during the dry down did I detect a little whiff of tuberose, if at all. Maybe it had to do with the weather, but regardless of the reason, this variability appeals to me. I find this scent very natural smelling, happy and uplifting. I think it is a scent that will appeal to me I five or ten years time as well, so I got myself a full bottle and am very happy with it.', 'I have to confess that when I first got the sample of this scent (along with Une Rose and POAL) I paid no mind to this scent at all—it seemed nice, but just that. However, having used the three scents for a couple of times, this definitely becomes the best of the three. While POAL is beautifully composed, I really have to be in the mood for how strong it is. But Lys M. not just works with essentially everything from a simple day to a date, it is also to my nose very unisex for a guy who likes floral scent. I didn’t expect much from it but then it lasts above decent on body and forever on clothes, it performs without screaming, and most most unexpectedly, my date just goes insane with the smell. Yes, in reality now I’ve come to find a huge sexiness of this one, especially in close encounter probably equal to Musc Ravageur! What sets it above Musc Ravageur (which I also really like) is that Musc Ravageur’s sexiness comes from spices, which is more common (like in Rose 31, whose sexiness I find ‘a bit too trying’) than one that effortlessly comes from light-scented flower like this bottle.  An unexpected must-have for now. I recommend you not just smelling it but give it a couple of uses with tester!', ""Lys Mediterranee has the most beautiful and realistic lily note that I've encountered in perfumery so far. I find that lilies are often covered up by brasher floral notes or their peppery, powdery or sweet qualities are exaggerated to the point that they no longer smell like themselves. The lily note here is like a beautiful woman wearing minimal makeup - just a polished version of herself without covering up her natural beauty. Grace Kelly at the seaside. Lys is almost a soliflore, with the other notes playing a supportive role. I smell a slightly salty breeze, musk, smooth orange blossom and oddly enough, almond. It is not sharp or green on me at all, and smells best in spring or summer - humidity and heat allow it to bloom. That said, I do find the sillage to be on the low to average side. It's a sheer scent; my only critique would be to have made it just a bit richer and denser. I keep this as a special occasion perfume so that I can afford to apply more. Love."", ""This is beautifully GREEN. It's exactly how I like my lillies, I think this is the lily queen. The angelica is beautifully bitter and bracing on opening before settling into the mineral ocean notes and a super realistic waxy, briny lily.  Make no mistake this is floral in the sense of wilderness. Not a trace of sweetness. It's like tumbling through grass bushes, only to fall to the granite rocks soaked with sea foam.  Green, bitter, cold, waxy and briny. Wonderful scent."", 'The white floral scents with ABSOLUTELY NO sweetness. Instead, it\'s almost salty due to the ocean note. This green non-sweet white floral accord dominates the entire perfume. Except that, at the beginning, there is this sour-green vegetal notes, possibly due to orange blossom. Then at some point it starts to have a very specific ""boiled leaves"" variation: we Chinese have a traditional rice dessert called ""zongzi""; It’s made of steamed glutinous rice, wrapped in bamboo, reed, or other large flat leaves. At this stage the perfume smell just like those wrapping leaves, even with the lingering creamy smell of rice. I don\'t know if it\'s suggestive of angelica, it surely is interesting.', 'I just have to write a few words on this magical perfume. I got a sample last summer when I was crazy about lilies. Some friends brought us a large bunch of beautiful, big, white lilies and they scented our home for weeks. I wanted to find something that smelled as beautiful, and did some ill-advised blind buys that smelled nothing like the real thing. When I finally got to Lys Mediterranee we were well into autumn and it didn’t hit the spot. I felt it didn’t have enough body, that it was a little weak.  Fast forward to an unseasonably hot May, full blown summer where the weather usually is cool and spring takes its first steps. I sprayed some of my FMP sample on my arm and three days later I had to buy a bottle. This is one of the few perfumes that I don’t wear solely for my own pleasure. This one really is a gift to the world. It is like inviting someone into a shaded garden, where the lilies grow in the green shade of big, leafy trees, and where the lovely scent of the lilies mingles with grass, wet earth, wood. It is just so wonderful and so perfect for a hot day that I want to share it with everyone. If you love lilies, you must try this one. Frederic Malle has 10 ml bottles that doesn’t ruin you, if you have to make a blind buy :-)', ""I just got another (yet another) green, herby / floral thing. Just green, plant stems and grass and maybe a hint of a bruised water-lily. Pretty pathetic in my eyes tbh - this stuff is easily over $200 in most stores that sell it. Awful! Get Rose 31 all day, any day to suffice your spring / summer aquatic/floral/greeny fix, it's a wonderful bottle of surprises and an all-time Classic in the frag game My rating: 2/10"", ""Lys Mediterranee is very floral and crisp. This fragrance makes me think of Summer and lush vegetation. The aquatic aspect is certainly present, however it is not entirely oceanic, meaning I'm not picking up on any salt water accords, or anything beach related. It's more so the scent of dewy white florals after a heavy downpour of rain. The scent itself reminds me of a florist's shop. The lily of the valley is very strong, followed by notes of orange blossom and jasmine. The overall blend is very green and pristine. Lys Mediterranee is quite a cold and somewhat icy fragrance. It's very clean but also very natural, like something you'd easily picture yourself smelling in garden-like surroundings. I am really enjoying smelling this fragrance as I find it quite intriguing.  It's a relatively light and airy scent, also quite linear, but that is in no way a negative aspect, as the blend itself is one I can honestly describe as very moving and beautiful. On the skin, it tends to become quite subtle, almost transforming itself into a very soothing skin scent. The longevity is rather persistent though, holding on my skin for nearly the whole day."", '6/10', 'Instant love for this lys, that doesn\'t scream and simply is, salty and sweet, and it stays and stays, minimalist and effortless. I\'m trying to forget Luca Turin\'s ""gourmand"" association for this perfume: I appreciate his ironic style and he surely does know what\'s good and worthy but sometimes he\'s just not that into elegance, let\'s put it like this. I really want at least a decant of this beauty.', ""I enjoy the scent of lilies in nature, but I don't find lily perfumes that wearable. They have a throwback, formal quality—a rarefied air. This one opens up as a potent lily soliflore. I don't picture a single perfect lily, but heaps of them, piling up around me, multiplying like rabbits. Their silky, silty pollen is well-rendered with a green gingery note. In the middle, the fragrance relaxes enough to suit a casual day. It isn't gourmand, but it becomes sweet and airy as whipped cream. Finally, there is an aquatic note of subtle pool water that accords very well with the innate green spiciness of the lily. I could see this as a slow burn fragrance that grows on me, but for now I'm putting it on the backburner. It feels too gentle for the hottest days—I seem to reach for my sample in mild, overcast weather. ETA: I did buy a travel size. This is a perfume you can really live with. It has a distinct identity, but it's not overpowering. Wore it on vacation to Japan. Good in the humidity."", 'It is been a month, that I own decant of this beauty, thanks to lovely Ioli19, and attempted to write reviews few times, but it is not easy. There is so much oceanic tranquillity, it is like sailing on a beautiful white yacht to forgotten islands in a dusk. Lys is a persistent scent, yet with certain stillness and serenity. I have to agree with the previous reviewer - Tigerlillian, who gets a lot of lotus character out of it. Intoxicating starter of blue lotus absolu to me. Spicy-creamy drydown is more lily-based though and for some reason I get ancient Asia vibe, wearing this charming fragrance, rather than Mediterranean countries one.', ""Here is some bright, uplifting serenity. Quietly energetic and understated, just as the lotus flower. I find Lys Mediterranee to be more about the lotus' character -- soft but strong. Peppery, aquatic and green rather than salty marine, accented with the bitterness of lily. The angelica and ginger somehow take me back to a sampling of DSH Padme Lotus and the violet leaf and marigold accord I experienced there. Also in the realm of aromatics in Parfums 01630 Lys. Lys Mediterranee dries down to quieter serenity as the aromatics dissipate. Soft, fresh aquatic flowers, cool, clean coastal air with little salt. Like a shallow freshwater pond full of lotus in a perfectly manicured backyard of a coastal mansion enclosed by a tall concrete wall -- flowers barely tinged with marine air and cold stone -- the scent of peaceful solitude."", ""Un giglio verde,agro,intenso e carnoso con apertura maschile con ginger crudo. Sempre naturale vira in un mughetto da comunione appena raccolto..in riva a un laghetto. Non il mio genere mi manca di dolcezza e cremosita',ma se apprezzi profumi alla De Profundis e' da provare. Un lys e' piu'versatile e molto meno riflessivo. Buona fattura , unisex,pulito ed estivo. Supernatural!"", 'It starts with a nice oriental lily and then it morphs into lily of the valley. Lotus comes in and keeps it very floral and angelica stays in the background giving a earthy brown-ness that keeps it from being just another pretty floral. It could have the potential to become one of my favorite florals if it lasted for more that a few hours on me.', ""I've just added Lys Mediterrannee to my relatively small fragrance collection. I am not a collector, I only buy fragrances that I actually wear, and each new purchase has to be significantly different from what I already have. I chose Lys Mediterranee because it's exceptionally beautiful and original. The perfumer Edouard Flechier (the man who created Poison!) has wondefully captured the scent of the Mediterranean. The marine note is to die for - so fresh and salty; the flowers are ever so slightly damp, yet delicate and pretty, and the drydown is quite musky. Wonderful projection and longevity, as one would expect from the Frederic Malle line. I don't think of this as a summer scent - in fact I'm more than happy to wear it now, during the winter, and to revive the memories of the salty waves and the long sandy beaches."", 'Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son - Claude Monet - 1875 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++', 'Lys Mediterranee evokes the heat of a summer afternoon, where the Mediterranean sea breeze mixed with the soft and spicy scent of lilies. Daylilies have always been some flowers prized by ancient Mediterranean civilizations and its history dates back to ancient Egypt. Elegant and majestic aroma of white flowers conveys a feature of purity, generosity and innocence. Flechier has given us this tribute to the aroma of this beautiful, opulent floral quite realistically and with an almost surround start to aquatic freshness, just a sweet spot and light vanilla with a vaporous cloud of soft musk, almost imperceptible, to extend a little longer lasting fragrance. If portrait of a Lady is the sumptuous Baroque Malle Lys Mediterranee is its counterpoint, is pure impressionism minimal. Both spectacular. Rating: 9', ""I like almost everything I've tried by Frederic Malle, but this I love. The authenticity of the lily note is sublime, green and light. The aquatic note, unlike many other which are too watery is fresh and clean but with body and blended perfectly to raise the lily, soften the ginger and allow the angelica to breathe. What marks FM fragrances apart from (some) others at the mid-range price is the skill of the composers. Lys Mediteranee is an elegant symphony, noticeable for its quality, subtle in its execution and sophisticated in its completion."", ""DELIGHTED to own this breath taking MASTERPIECE!! Soft green lilies by the Mediterranean Sea, the marine note is perfect. I could not adore it any more than I already do. Lys Mediterranee there's no other like you!"", ""I have tested a lot of lily scents and this one is a like/don't like lily. Each time I test a lily fragance it comes to my mind a cosy name as sweet lily, romantic lily, green lily, bitch lily, elegant lily but this one is almost the austere lily. Yep it is as the lily came out from a man's world. It is green, musc and sometimes bitter/sour as in neroli (the same note as in Puro Neroli). Worth of its price? For the lily lovers as me well but Le labo lily feels more Sunny and brighter and I dare to say easier to wear in the spring. Anyway my austere lily will be a few more times tested before going to the wish list."", ""This opens with a beautiful fresh lily on me. I love this part, because I love lilies but I am terribly allergic to them. Quickly the marine notes come in, and I am less enthused. After the opening, it turns into the scent of a beach-themed candle on me, and I do not like beach themed candles. It's the first fragrance in a while that I've had to go scrub off in the bathroom sink. It's a beautiful idea, lilies and aquatics, but it definitely does not live up to the hype for me. Am I the only person who really doesn't like this scent? I'm envious of those who can enjoy it, because the lily opening is wonderful."", ""I got a sample of this perfume and I think this is really a perfume for women, not men. It is very sweet, reminds me of the color light pink, and for me it smells very generic actually, and not unique. It opens super sweet and becomes better with time, but still, I am not impressed (or maybe I just don't get it)"", ""This is an extremely well-balanced perfume - it is flowery, warm, a bit heady, but also strangely fresh. You can feel the sun in summer when you smell this - not a Scandinavian or Tropical sun, but indeed a Mediterranean sun. It reminds me of a little road going uphill in Castilla-La Mancha in Southern Spain, with flowers and bushes growing by the side and the sun baking from above. Fortunately, it is not only heat and flowers, but also that little bit of fresh, cool water. Unfortunately, I don't like lilies. Sillage and longevity seem quite decent to very good."", ""First sniff of Lys Mediterranee is filled with fresh coumarins and aquatic notes. These notes are joined quickly by lily notes, mixed with green notes of angelica and a hint of white florals. The white florals seem to give the lily notes an edge, the coumarin topping it off and the ozonic aquatic notes giving it a fresh feel at this point. The scent still has a green undertone. I also smell some metallic notes at this point. The drydown is somewhere in between green/aquatic and lily-floral and fades out gently as time progresses.  Sillage and longevity are moderate.  I enjoy this scent very much, the combination of the aquatics and the floral notes gives the impression of a sea breeze carrying floral notes. I sniffed it and was instantly reminded of my childhood holidays at the mediterranean sea. The effect of the florals and the greens remind me of Frederic Malle's Carnal Flower, but here the iris is much more toned down and there is this strange sea breeze effect that makes the scent suddenly reappear just as you forgot you were wearing it. For me, this is a great spring and summer scent and full bottle worthy!"", ""This marine note is magnificent. A real tang. I live next to the sea and this scent is ozonic like Beyond Paradise, only much, much better, and the lily in this is also magnificent. This had me at Hello. It's strong, but not headachy, and it lasts well, which it should for the ££££ - but I have to agree with Luca, that this is a wonderful achievement by Flechier. I have samples, but nothing else will do now, that I buy a full bottle. The lily is so good, that it has that nearly-meaty quality. The drydown is different again: musky orange blossom, sweet and pretty. A bit on the female side of unisex. The ginger is the lightest touch thankfully. This is in my top 10 of all time. *adores* Update: I now have my big bottle of this salty wonder. Delighted with it x"", ""I am really enjoying this perfume. I debated over buying it for a long time as it's so expensive. Whilst I loved it's initial fresh, natural, botanical impression, I was concerned that once I owned it and used it regularly I may find it becomes boring, synthetic (as a couple of reviews have mentioned)or too cold and metallic.  But this is not the case. It is effortlessly elegant and appropriate for any occasion (though it's best during the Summer I imagine. It reminds me of the smell of a florists shop or a vase of freshly cut white flowers and leaves, as others have mentioned.  On initial wearing, I did question its longevity and sillage. However, 6 hours after application when I could not really detect it that much, my mother asked me what fragrance I was wearing as I stepped into the car beside her. My mum is a keen gardener who has cultivated many lilies and exotic white flowers from many parts of the world. She said she loved the smell and that it was relaxing and made her want to keep inhaling. The smell is floral but the leafy greenness stops it becoming too girly. Over time it works really well with my skin into becoming a soft, clean scent.  It's a masterpiece."", ""I had a small sample of this a while back, tried it on and thought 'nice lily, a bit clean, elegant' and wasn't particularly wowed. But, the second time I tried it I sprayed more on and wore it out for the evening with what I call my 'Breakfast at Tiffany's dress'(black, with ivory cotton lace-trim) which changed my perception completely!  I'd already felt this was an Audrey Hepburn-esque sort of floral, but I hadn't noticed the dry down before as I'd not worn a generous enough spray. After a proper wearing I'm now convinced this is my absolute favourite from the FM perfumes. I really 'get' the Medittareanean feel of it now. It's not just the subtle hint of salt, it actually smells like Mediterannean skin - there's a hint of olive oil and muskiness, overlayed with this slightly clean yet creamy lily which almost reminds me of lily of the valley but nowhere near as 'guesthouse soap as that tends to be. It also reminds me for some reason of my childhood friend's mum, who was from Rome, stunningly good looking - almost Loren-like (she always smelled of olive oil and soap)she had a kind of beehive hairdo well into the 80s! A bit naff, but nice. Anyway, this sort of Dolce Vita feel is in Lys M I feel. I think ginger gives this perfume the peppery edge that lily perfumes need, without it becoming too carnation-like. As usual I'm havering on about notes and places, but to cut a long story short, this is a sexy, pretty yet elegant and timeless perfume, I feel. I was complimented on it twice the evening I wore a more generous spray, first by a female friend, then by a handsome Japanese cellist who kept sniffing my neck. We had a kiss while dancing, but he was too young for me. (Not that I'm complaining!)  Maybe it was that last fact which swayed me to buy a bottle! But really it's the beautiful drydown, and the fact I find it difficult to find good perfumes for evening. My other favourite for evenings is Lumiere Noire, but for spring/summer Lys Mediterranee is perfection. Gorgeous. Sillage and longevity moderate to strong depending on application"", 'This perfume is as interesting as it is pleasant - it is an olifactory game in a bottle. This take on the lily opens with a curious blend of herbal and marine notes (presumably the ""Mediterranee""aspect), mixed with sweet sharp florals (almost orange-blossom like). Strong and a little disconcerting to the nose, but quite amusing intellectually. The mid-notes settle to a pleasant, pure, lily. At this point you would swear it was a soliflore. Then it fades to a more blended white floral backed by a little musk, with little to no trace of lily remaining. Although the opening notes are reasonably unisex, I would not call this fragrance \'unisex\', as it develops quite feminine, floral characteristics as it progresses. It does not have great stamina with respect to either silage or longevity.', ""I tried this as a sample late summer and loved it. Fresh, bright, great for work. It seemed like a shoo-in. As a winter fragrance, it's airy and crisp with a definite unisex feel. On me it's like a more sophisticated CK One.  I suspect this is much more appealing as a summer fragrance and will test it again in a few months."", 'Very White flowery and Greeny, its remind me a garden with full of grass and white flower with breeze of oceans.', ""Lilies are not my favourites, but I love this one. It has character, it is not sweet or powdery. I love Edouard Fléchier's perfumes Poison and Une Rose as well."", ""This, to me, is one of the only true florals a plain ordinary guy like me can wear without blushing.  The first beautiful intense minutes are followed by beautiful hours during which the spices and musk do a great job of subduing the lily. And to me this is a true-to-life lily, with its slight fennel (some say salami) scent, which hits me whenever I enter a flower shop.  I recommend trying this and waiting a solid hour before judging it. It's far more comfortable to wear than one might think."", 'The specific elements that I notice are greenness and orange blossom with the rest very well blended. I definitely don\'t smell ginger or ""sea water"" (whatever that would mean in a perfume context). LM is in similar vein as L\'Artisan La Chasse Aux Papillons and By Killian Love & Tears, but I like La Chasse better because it doesn\'t have the greenness and LM is much less indolic than Love & Tears (though the orange blossom stands out in both L&T and LM). The top notes, esp. the green ones - would turn harsh on me below ~60f and given where I live that pretty much takes this off the table. Pretty good longevity. Sillage when applied from a sample vial is mild. Suspect it would be stronger in spray just because you\'d get more perfume. It\'s very beautiful and certainly worth a sniff if you like florals.', 'Utterly beautiful - sea water and ginger mingling delicately with lily must be one of the most unexpected and divine concoctions ever - not harmed by the superbly balanced layering and mixing of the scents to create such heaven to the nose...something in the saltiness raises up feelings of longing and tenderness in me, almost as if distant memories of a faraway trip come back, not strongly enough to throw me off track but tenderly, hinting, as if to say, remember me? Remember this time and place? Can you hear the seagulls, can you hear the waves gently lapping against the boat as we lie on our backs, wishing we could stay under this blue sky forever?', ""A lovely, elegant floral acquatic. This makes me think of Merchant Ivory films where a young, well-to-do couple go boating on a serene lake, staring lovingly into each other's eyes (I think it's a law that all Merchant Ivory films have that scene in them somewhere, so it doesn't matter which one).  I don't really get the spice here which is a little disappointing as I love ginger. The strongest accords on my skin are lily and lotus.  It's unashamedly feminine and floral, which I actually find quite refreshing given the current trend for perfumes to be super realistic. This one isn't trying to be a field/pond/jacket at all, it's a perfume, romantic and dreamy and it makes no apologies for that.  The fact it's not trying to be trendy makes it very clean and simple, which I very much appreciate.  Opening notes offer a slightly synthetic smell that I don't care for, but it's gone in about 10-15 minutes.  Moderate sillage and longevity is around 5-6 hours on me, which could be better."", 'When first applied, this seems very ""green"" to me, but as it matures, I\'m getting nothing so much as a blend of lily and oud (?) though agarwood is not listed among the ingredients. In drydown, this really reminds me of Lush/Gorilla Perfumes\' Smell of Freedom. This one has nice longevity. Still perceptible 7 hours after I put it on this morning.', ""I can't say enough about this fragrance!  Modern…chic…crisp…clean…INTERESTING!  At the start, I'm always swept away in a dewy whirlwind of crashing salt water, ginger, citrus, musk, and lily of the valley all at once. I think it's a really versatile summer/spring scent and can be appreciated by just about anyone. But most of all… It inspires thoughts of what I think the single and modern city girl wears when she and a few girlfriends have packed their designer luggage and rented a weekend house in the Hamptons or other fancy beach destination. While sitting on the ocean front porch listening to the latest music, sipping on some nouveau alcohol-infused lemonade cocktail; they shift easily between dancing and conversation about work, boyfriends, and pop culture.  The silage is moderate but longevity on my skin INCREDIBLE at upwards 6+ hours."", ""Simply a superb fragrance. Recognizable, intense, I think it's one of the best floral scents available. 10/10"", 'strange someone could smell lily of the valley here (maybe a confusion of flowers, ""muguet"" in french means ""lily of the valley"", but here it is ""lys"" which simply means ""lily"" or ""fleur-de-lis""). I smell full fleshy lily extended on the salty/bitter ends, a saltiness which lily has- in my opinion- in it\'s natural smell too, but not as strong as here.  it\'s a bit like a hotelroom in an old villa in venice would smell, if you forget big white lillies there in the vase and come back from a short holiday at the lido a day after they started to fade (with your hair still uncombed and the salt in it)....not at all a bad connotation..', ""Amazing! Perfect adventure scent:) This is what it reminds me of: Warm Summer day at Portofino, enjoying the day at the mesmerizing sea and adoring beautiful views with your significant other.

All of your senses are pleasantly enhanced and you just want to embrace this moment forever:) Well, that's my little getting carried away with this fragrance story.

Worth a try this fragrance of beauty :)"", ""This will probably the only lily perfume I am going to own as I've never liked lily in my perfumes. On the other hand I love LYS MEDITERRANEE and let me tell you why - it is no so much about lily, flowers in general, but about spicy herbal scent I get from ginger and angelica (and also of course lily it elf). The salty sea note makes it even better.  For me this is an evening at the beach - salty, aromatic, breezy, herbal. I can almost smell how sand beneath my feet would feel.  It is not overly feminine, nor masculine, it is also not aquatic. I could go on for pages saying what LYS MEDITERRANEE is not, because it is so hard to understand what it is. I only know that -  - this is a masterpiece. Really unique and I love it."", ""Lys Mediterranee is a seductive, mesmerizing, bite of the night full of romance and a hint of danger. This perfume by Editions de Parfums Fredric Malle was created in the year 2000 by the nose Edoaurd Flechier who also created such perfumes as C’est La Vie by Christian Lacroix and Poison for Dior. Here with Fredric Malle as in all cases with this perfume house the nose gets his or her name in lights along with the perfume. Usually the Parfumeur is never mentioned. It is the house or the celebrity who gets the name in up front and center. So Bravo to Fredric Malle for giving the Nose its due.  The perfume is a sensual and subtle uni-sex fragrance that really is perfect on both men and women. There is a fleshy sexiness in the mix that I find most enticing. It opens with a salty wave of an oceanic note that is spiced up with a strong dose of ginger. This opening is as bright as a spring sunrise in Saint Tropez. It sparkles and jumps off the skin for a moment and then it sinks down very fast into the wet earthy heart of the perfume. Like a vampire at dawn, it goes to ground.  Here in the heart notes is the star, the lily full of fleshy ripe indolic sensuality. The note is ripe and rich bordering on the verge of a delicious sumptuous rot. Not to worry, it never tips into compost but stays airborne above the skin curvy and lush and ready for almost anything. It smells a little dirty too and naughty as well. This might be aided by the pungent dirtiness of the Angelica but never tips into nasty boy or slutty girl territory due to the buoyant beauty that comes from the water lily note and a sweet spray of orange blossom.  The lily note hangs in there throughout and into the dry down with finds its support from a curling and creamy vanilla that elongates the sultry aspect of the perfume. There is a musk note but it plays way in the back more as a longevity aid than anything else.  The projection on this perfume is not too strong. It is a romantic scent that demands closeness not a boisterous hey come up and see me sometime fragrance. More of a lets get cozy and intimate perfume. The longevity is very good at about eight to nine hours.  Lys Mediterranee is of the three S’s in my view, Sultry, Sensuous and Sexy. I find it to be full of life and utterly inviting. I must thank the charming and very beautiful Chase at Barney’s NY in San Francisco for leading me to this wonderful perfume and for sharing her expertise and time with me on the house of Editions de Parfums Fredric Malle.

I fell in love with this in Zurich, and well...', ""This scent takes me away from my city life to a quiet beachside cottage with planters of lilies all around the windows which allow a steady current of refreshing, salty sea breeze in 24 hours. Beyond the lilies is a little herb garden shaded by orange trees. Life-like, vast lilies, their heady sweetness tempered by ginger and citrus notes on a background of seawater, in a bottle. While this and Cartier's Baiser Vole are two of my favourite lily scents, Lys Mediterranee takes the cake for being more interesting. Sillage and longevity are both very good but have had no issues with either when it comes to FM's library of scents.

The opening smells so perfectly of a vase of lilies, with the creamy white petals and lush green stems. A few minutes after spraying, the scent warms on my skin and becomes richer and warmer, but still strikes me as a very ""true"" lily scent. I often have lilies in the house and there\'s no mistaking that fragrance! I\'m not usually impressed by such floral perfumes, but this is gorgeous. It makes me feel fresh, natural and delicate. I find it absolutely enchanting and can\'t stop pressing my nose to my wrist to get another hit. Radiant, elegant, and never loud or overbearing. EDIT - My SO describes this as honeyed, he thinks it is very sweet and warm.', ""For the record, this is primarily lily of the valley, despite the note not being listed in the scent pyramid.  Lys Mediterranee is very floral and crisp. This fragrance makes me think of Summer and lush vegetation. The aquatic aspect is certainly present, however it is not entirely oceanic, meaning I'm not picking up on any salt water accords, or anything beach related. It's more so the scent of dewy white florals after a heavy downpour of rain. The scent itself reminds me of a florist's shop. The lily of the valley is very strong, followed by notes of orange blossom and jasmine. The overall blend is very green and pristine. Lys Mediterranee is quite a cold and somewhat icy fragrance. It's very clean but also very natural, like something you'd easily picture yourself smelling in garden-like surroundings. I am really enjoying smelling this fragrance as I find it quite intriguing. I actually much prefer this fragrance over Carnal Flower due to its watery-like freshness. It's a relatively light and airy scent, also quite linear, but that is in no way a negative aspect, as the blend itself is one I can honestly describe as very moving and beautiful. On the skin, it tends to become quite subtle, almost transforming itself into a very soothing skin scent. The longevity is rather persistent, holding on my skin for nearly the whole day. I must say that this is one of the nicest interpretations of lily of the valley, perhaps even exceeding Diorissimo in terms of being more natural and more skilfully executed."", 'I am confused about whether the ""lys"" in Frédéric Malle LYS MEDITERRANEE is supposed to be lily or lily of the valley. And is ginger lily a flower or do we have ginger and lily or LOTV here? In any case, to my nose, this perfume opens with a burst of bright orange blossom before an aromatic quality of mingling ginger and angelica sweep in to create a unisex out of what seemed as though it was going to be a feminine floral perfume! I am reminded in wearing LYS MEDITERRANEE of the opening of Bond no 9 NEW YORK FLING, which is erroneously marketed to women when in fact it is a completely unisex and barely floral aromatic perfume featuring ginger as the focal note. The ginger in LYS MEDITERRANEE is not quite as marked as in NEW YORK FLING, but it still is enough to make this seem far less floral than I had been expecting.  Yes, mediterranean seem apt here: fresh and breezy, this is an easy fragrance to wear. Pretty much the antithesis of POISON, amazingly created by the very same perfumer: Edouard Fléchier.

It was an extraordinary experience on a hot and humid summer day, the aroma I felt was so fragrant. I have never imagined I could have a chance to feel this in natural environment.

So what a perfumer should do is to create something new, whether it's the reminiscence of a moment, or a feeling, or whatever; it's useless to replicate a natural smell.

On me this actually is a aquatic floral, it makes me think of lotusflowers in an almost hidden pond in the garden surrounded by lush flowers and bushes. It is really nice, warm and cozy but something in some note dosn´t really work with my chemistry, I can sense a little bit of something plastic or fake.

Make no mistake this is floral in the sense of wilderness. Not a trace of sweetness. It's like tumbling through grass bushes, only to fall to the granite rocks soaked with sea foam.  Green, bitter, cold, waxy and briny. Wonderful scent."", ""I had a small sample of this a while back, tried it on and thought 'nice lily, a bit clean, elegant' and wasn't particularly wowed. But, the second time I tried it I sprayed more on and wore it out for the evening with what I call my 'Breakfast at Tiffany's dress'(black, with ivory cotton lace-trim) which changed my perception completely!  I'd already felt this was an Audrey Hepburn-esque sort of floral, but I hadn't noticed the dry down before as I'd not worn a generous enough spray. After a proper wearing I'm now convinced this is my absolute favourite from the FM perfumes. I really 'get' the Medittareanean feel of it now. It's not just the subtle hint of salt, it actually smells like Mediterannean skin - there's a hint of olive oil and muskiness, overlayed with this slightly clean yet creamy lily which almost reminds me of lily of the valley but nowhere near as 'guesthouse soap as that tends to be. It also reminds me for some reason of my childhood friend's mum, who was from Rome, stunningly good looking - almost Loren-like (she always smelled of olive oil and soap)she had a kind of beehive hairdo well into the 80s! A bit naff, but nice. Anyway, this sort of Dolce Vita feel is in Lys M I feel. I think ginger gives this perfume the peppery edge that lily perfumes need, without it becoming too carnation-like. As usual I'm havering on about notes and places, but to cut a long story short, this is a sexy, pretty yet elegant and timeless perfume, I feel. I was complimented on it twice the evening I wore a more generous spray, first by a female friend, then by a handsome Japanese cellist who kept sniffing my neck. We had a kiss while dancing, but he was too young for me. (Not that I'm complaining!)  Maybe it was that last fact which swayed me to buy a bottle! But really it's the beautiful drydown, and the fact I find it difficult to find good perfumes for evening. My other favourite for evenings is Lumiere Noire, but for spring/summer Lys Mediterranee is perfection. Gorgeous. Sillage and longevity moderate to strong depending on application"", ""we are facing a masterpiece. it opens with a really sea breeze. but real, it doesn't even seem artificially created. melancholy, moving, sad and hopeful. a pure, clean green lily. I would wear it all year round. green. also racice smell. I have tears as I write about this perfume. I don't feel the orange blossom, musk, vanilla and ginger. 10/10 maybe it doesn't project very well ... but just go fast with the sprays. god bless edouard flèchier."", ""I've just added Lys Mediterrannee to my relatively small fragrance collection. I am not a collector, I only buy fragrances that I actually wear, and each new purchase has to be significantly different from what I already have. I chose Lys Mediterranee because it's exceptionally beautiful and original. The perfumer Edouard Flechier (the man who created Poison!) has wondefully captured the scent of the Mediterranean. The marine note is to die for - so fresh and salty; the flowers are ever so slightly damp, yet delicate and pretty, and the drydown is quite musky. Wonderful projection and longevity, as one would expect from the Frederic Malle line. I don't think of this as a summer scent - in fact I'm more than happy to wear it now, during the winter, and to revive the memories of the salty waves and the long sandy beaches."", ""This is such a beautiful and naturalistic perfume that does exactly what it says on the box! It's a lovely and light as well as slightly aquatic ginger lily perfume that is a bit green and salty and makes one think of the beach. The seagulls pass by and you sniff these lillies on the beach while the salty air also wafts through your nostrils while you're wearing a white bikini and a white linen dress. It's so naturalistic smelling, which is what I like in fragrances. It's a very feminine and white floral perfume too that is very calming and serene and also isn't indolic smelling. It smells like a summer vacation! I could imagine being in Rhode Island in the United States, Greece or Cyprus during the summer wearing this. I can smell the sea salt and the slightly spicy ginger at the top, which gives this perfume a light and fresh character that goes through the whole life of this fragrance. I can then smell all of the notes listed here in the heart notes, but the lily note is the strongest of course, followed by the orange blossom. I can then smell hints of the green and rooty angelica and the aquatic lotus. Finally, I can smell some musk at the base. I can't really smell the vanilla in the base though. Both sillage and projection are moderate on me, with this fragrance lasting 6 hours in total on my skin before dissipating completely. It's a perfume that's unusually both inoffensive and unique smelling, so you can definitely both wear this at work and not smell like everyone else with their La Vie Est Belle, My Way and Coco Mademoiselle's. I think that you could wear this during the evening too, making it a very versatile fragrance. I adore this perfume and I would give it an 8/10 in total for how good I think it is. Two thumbs up from me! 👍👍"", ""This is an extremely well-balanced perfume - it is flowery, warm, a bit heady, but also strangely fresh. You can feel the sun in summer when you smell this - not a Scandinavian or Tropical sun, but indeed a Mediterranean sun. It reminds me of a little road going uphill in Castilla-La Mancha in Southern Spain, with flowers and bushes growing by the side and the sun baking from above. Fortunately, it is not only heat and flowers, but also that little bit of fresh, cool water. Unfortunately, I don't like lilies. Sillage and longevity seem quite decent to very good."", ""My point is, you can't beat nature's perfumes. So what a perfumer should do is to create something new, whether it's the reminiscence of a moment, or a feeling, or whatever; it's useless to replicate a natural smell. Lys Mediterranee is a wonderful, natural, fresh smell of lilies. It gives you the feeling you get when you put your nose in a bunch of flowers. It's a wonderful replica, but that's where the problem is. Is there any point in such a beautiful exercise? I'd rather smell a real lily, then."", 'Wanted to love this one as the note breakdown sounded great, but unfortunately my skin brings out the worst of calone (which I get lots of here). The name is certainly fitting, and for those who love salty aquatics but want something with a floral twist, this is for you. For me, however, this genre just doesn’t cooperate with my skin', ""Lys Méditerranée by Frédéric Malle opens with an amazing salty breeze of lilies, capturing the true essence of the flower. However, the base notes quickly shift to an overpowering musk and vanilla, detracting from the initial allure. While the opening is captivating, the dry-down may disappoint. It’s tempting to reapply frequently to recapture that initial freshness, though this isn't the most practical solution."", ""Opens as brash, green, crisp and loud lily of the valley. Settles down a bit, but it is a fairly linear green floral. Longevity is excellent, sillage is fairly strong. I find this off-putting as it is a very strong floral green fragrance, but I can see it's interest for others.""]"

I thought, ""I would love a full, pure, dense, natural, lovely amber-centric, amber base fragrance."" Nothing more, nothing less. So, I purchased Profumum Roma ""Ambra Aurea"" and Histoires de Parfums ""Ambre 114."" Not sure how to compare, or rate Ambra Aurea because I know very little about amber fragrances. Any amber based fragrances I ever tried, were worn way in the past, like nearly a decade back. I always thought amber perfumes performed very masculine on my skin. With this said, I own and love Chanel ""Coromandel."" I also own and love By Kilian ""Incense Oud."" Ambra Aurea is really really nice. The perfume wears in an extremely smooth, dense, not-cloying, woody, (sorta) boozy way. Develops into a slightly creamy, woody, mildly smoky, resinous, vanilla scent. The base notes are wood, vanilla, slight incense and some spice (from the myrrh, I assume). And there\'s lovely, golden amber (of course). Duration and silage are enormous. I did one spray on each wrist when the fragrance arrived and my husband could smell me from the next room. It\'s nice. It\'s a keeper. EDITED TO ADD: This fragrance has really grown on me. I love it. It is gorgeous.', 'In Germanic mythology, amber was believed to derive from the petrified tears of the love goddess Freya, desperate for the death of her beloved. And there is no more appropriate connection. Amber to me represents warmth, elegance and animalicity in perfect balance, with those slightly vintage and dusty nuances making it irresistible to my nose. And here is all that wonderful mix, in a simple yet magnificent interpretation at the same time, with a touch of incense that makes it almost sacred, like a wonderful aura surrounding us. Gorgeous, to be included in the collection. I am a lover of amber worn on summer evenings, I find it extremely enhancing. ""Deep red on warm amber"" painted by Rothko.', ""Ambra Aurea is a smokey resinous amber, with an incense background. It leans masculine but I still enjoy smelling it a lot as it reminds me of something comforting and trustworthy. It is dry and on fire, but its not too hot. It's a low heat fire just enough to produce the smoke. It is smoldering and rich and spicy with the incense.  I love an Amber note, and currently my favorite amber-centric fragrance is Elie Saab no 3 Ambre. This is up there with the quality of that - perhaps this is No3 Ambre's more masculine brother, or husband.

Over the years it has garnered fewer than1000 votes. As a number of reviewers have said, however, this may well be the most authentic, powerful, and stunning amber to ever hit the market. Anyone who has an interest in amber scents should, at the very least, purchase a sample.  The list of notes here is simple enough. Amber, myrrh, and incense. However, some reviewers note how strong the abroxam note is and I agree. In any case this fragrance far outshines Ford's Amber Absolute (which I quite like by the way). Grand Soir is a shining star but it also highlights tonka and isn't trying to be an incense/myrrh mix. The scent leans masculine has strong silage and is long lasting. It is not a summer scent and not an office scent. It makes a statement: you feel great wearing it and want others to enjoy being in its presence.

Golden, honey yellow, deep amber, and brown striations run through it, all shot through with bubbles of trapped air, trapped millions of years ago. If that chunk of amber was lit on fire, I imagine that is what this perfume smells like. Resiny, deep, raw, animalic, incense, earthy. I can’t remember clearly, but I feel like that’s where they got the original dinosaur dna in the first Jurassic Park movie. From a mosquito trapped in amber, that had bitten a dinosaur just before it died. Which is so appropriate. This is an Amber perfume for a T Rex thundering through the jungle. It’s not soft, or friendly, or easy. But it is profound, momentous, and deeply beautiful. And it does get sweeter once it gets to know you, and has been on the skin a while. Ambra Aurea lasts 12 hours on skin and has enormous sillage the first 4 hours or so.', ""it's like a smokier amber absolute to my nose, i enjoy it"", ""Way too sweet.

It\'s not as scary as some people are saying. Has great longevity and low to moderate sillage. It does the job perfectly for such a scent, since you\'re not really wearing it as a ""compliment magnet"". Unlike most other amber scents, does not smell old or dated in the slightest.  Now, how does it compare to other Ambre scents, most notably Amber Absolute and Le Lion, which i consider my 3 favorite amber scents?  Le Lion - Le Lion is more complex, it evolves so much from beginning to the end. Ambra Aurea smells mostly like it in the drydown of Le Lion, but the Chanel has so much more stages. However, the amber drydown of the Chanel is the best part of it, and Ambra Aurea is better. However, because of the complexity, I\'d still consider Le Lion a 10/10 amber scent.  TF Amber Absolute - The most butch amber i have smelled. Is it as refined as this one? No... but it\'s more unapologetic. It\'s a strong smell, and i don\'t mean that only in terms of performance. I hate this term, but it is the alpha male of the amber scents.

Too bad this has been butchered and most likely reformulated.', 'An amber fragrance to crush all other amber scents.

It's dense. It's resinous. It stains. But considering the ingedients it's quite difficult to find something that isn't resinous or litterally a resin in this composition. Sometimes it even creates a thin layer on the atomizer distantly riminiscent of the crystallizations on the edges of honey jars. Very pleasing, not heavy on the skin and extremely natural. This perfume doesn't stay inert. It evolves and becomes darker and richer over time. The silkiness of golden amber, the elegance of incense and the depth of myrr give an ancient opulent vibe. Gold.

The scent of incense sits delicately on the skin; a true myrrh. The amber sticks down, almost resiny and has this really subtle vanilla sweetness to it (though I think this is dependant on your skin chemistry). There is also this tenuous candle wax smell for the first hour, personally I love the smell of candle wax so this is quite pleasant but you can only smell it if you're sticking your nose to your wrist. Though beware this perfume can be mistaken as a sandalwood fragrance to an amateur nose, which to me isn't a bad thing but if that's not what you're looking for I suggest purchasing a sample and giving it a try or just looking else where.

In strong opposition to what everyone seems to be experiencing, I actually don't find it very ambery. More resinous-incense. It's nice, but I'm unfortunately not blown away. In the end, it's too dark for me. I like a bit sweeter and comforting ambers. I don't find this sweet at all."", ""What an interesting scent. At first, I get a large blast of moth ball scent. Like spot-on moth ball. Not great. Underlying that is smoke and a resinous amber. This moth ball note (almost like a chemical ambroxan?) lasts for an hour or so but under that is a gorgeous vanilla/myrrh/ambergris base that is great. It's in the same vein as Ambre Sultan, Le Lion, Mitzah, and Amber Absolute. These are all great scents and I own each but they are wholly repetitive, in my opinion. As a collector, that's fine (I guess), but if I wanted just one of these amber-y, dry scents, I'd probably pick Ambre Sultan as it's the most interesting to my nose. Ambra Aurea is deep and gorgeous at the base but it's got a funky open. Longevity is insane. 12-14+ hours with moderate projection for at least 3-4 hours (or more).  A 8.0/10 for me.

There is not much there. I searched on Profumum and the official website, and there is absolutely nothing. The description says it's the smell of centuries old temptation and the smell of pleasure and warmth. That is exactly how you feel when you wear Ambra Aurea. However, some things have changed since I first tried this on in January of this year. There is some competition recently in relation to temptation, pleasure and sex. Sadonasso from Nasomatto may not be anyone's favorite, but if you put it on your clothes and then smell it the next day, it smells terrific. It's one of those fragrances that takes a while to appreciate. Yes they are both expensive, but if you combine the two, it could potentially make an elixir that would blow someone away.

For me, this combination is a musty old antique store or a library with ancient decaying leather bound books. This can be off-putting at first, but becomes deeply intriguing. After some wear, the sweetness of vanilla comes through. It takes me back to my father's smokey bee boxes with their honey-filled wax frames. In the end, the harsh musty smell dissipates almost completely. Leaving you with a playful cream soda sweetness. This is among the finest amber fragrances on the market."", ""(Edit: I’ve recently realized that this review is based on an older iteration of Ambra Aurea. The newer smells very good, but has less of the chewy, smoky depth. The newer juice leans more brown than golden in color, and there is much more vanilla to my nose. My guess is they had to slightly reformulate this since the older batches created a crystalized substance on the atomizer, as others have mentioned. Still a fantastic, strong fragrance, but it’s only fair to mention the differences.) A stellar amber with A+ ingredients. On first spray I get the impression of an orange creamcicle. Of course there's no actual orange, so I think it's the lemony dry olibanum mixing with the amber accord (which, according to noses more refined than mine, may actually contain real ambergris as well as labdanum.) After just a few minutes that creamy/fruity opening fades and I begin smelling a wonderful incense and myrrh smoke with sticky, not-too-sweet amber. The dry frankincense and myrrh resins are still there at the top. About 3 or 4 hours in, the dry resins fade and the vanillic sweetness of the amber accord amps up. The dry down is an ultra-rich, creamy, sweet vanilla amber with a touch of incense smoke. It is absolutely fantastic. It lasts on my skin at least 12 hours, and that dry down remains a skin scent pretty much until you wash it off. This feels like the ultra-refined lovechild of Amber Absolute and Interlude Man. The hype is deserved as this is one of the best Amber scents I have ever tried."", 'No, it’s not wrong to say “this reminds me of no 5. Or LDDM”. It’s also reminiscent of Le Lion. It’s the labdanum like the person below me noted.  I don’t wear number 5 but the other two I wear quite a lot. And there are shades of them in this wonderful scent. It’s a deep amber punctuated with that leathery rock rose. It’s beast mode, nuclear, whatever you’d like to call your strongest sents. This is that. I get this old ball glove/saddle feel. 10/10 Mayybe a 9.5. What a gem I lose soo many of my favorite scents after a short time each wearing. This never fails to reach my nose, hours after applying.', ""Ambra Aurea is an intersection of old and new. Old school funky resins and potent performance meets modern reductionist aesthetic.  An amber fragrance, stripped of unnecessary frills and ribbons, but retaining the roughness and character of crude labdanum, peru balsam and benzoin. There in an animalic character around the edges. No citrussy herbal top notes or floral hearts here. Ambra Aurea is an amber powerhouse, with only modest accents by cinnamon and myrrh. Vanilla and ambergris-type materials boost its reach into a true golden cloud.  (What appears to be) a pyrogenated labdanum extract in the base brings smokiness while still remaining true to the original concept.  Apply sparingly, this one has the potential to be cloying.

I could feel the slightly spicy accords of other notes, but overall it was a very direct, non-sweet, almost blunt fragrance without the deeper heart. The sillage was incredibly strong too even after only 1 spray. It's very important not to overdo this fragrance, as it quickly becomes too dominant. For me this amber is very reminiscent of Diptyque room spray called Ambre. The Diptyque composition is also sharp, very linear, without any sweet and soft accords. Unfortunately, because of how similar they are, I would not be purchasing this fragrance, as I'd rather invest into more complex amber perfume pieces. For example, for me, something sweet and complex like EL BORN by carner barcelona would work slightly better. I find this fragrance deeper, more interesting and simply easier to wear."", 'In short, this is a grown-up, head-turning, long lasting, slightly animalic amber scent.

It is very strong, amazingly projecting and unisex - it can be worn by both men and women who are confident/have the main character vibes.

My new fav. It is not warm weather perfume, it would choke everyone around but I can see this being worn during daytime in colder months, but again by strong personality and confident men and women only, if you cannot handle wearing things like Hypnotic Poison/ Shalimar/Opium during the daytime, this is not a daytime perfume for you. Blind buy - this is very difficult to put hands-on and testers or full bottles are mostly available only through the official websites of Profumum in Italy (UK/EU market). I would say to buy this blindly only (!!) if you love YSL Opium EDP and EDT, Shalimar by Guerlain and maybe Hermes Lambre des Marseilles (similar amber vibes), that is what I did.

He’s going to eat her out for hours, and to him, it’s like the finest gourmand dessert he’s ever tasted. That’s Ambra Aurea. I absolutely love the campfire quality on which this begins. It reminds me of a campfire-scented Yankee I had as a teenager and smelled whenever I needed to de-stress or pick up my spirits. The smokiness does fade into the background, but the warm spice lives on. I can understand the previous reviewer’s mention of condensed milk. This is sultry, gourmand, rich, and thick. I love it.', ""Okay, I was prepared to be blown away by this and maybe that's my mistake. When I first put it on, I started laughing. I purchased a head shop Frankincense and Myrrh fragrance at $8 for 1oz bottle and it smells EXACTLY the same. And the cheap stuff lasts much longer than this. It's a lovely resinous ambery scent, but wow. For the price tag, the head shop oil is much better."", '267 It’s mainly a labdanum(cistus) note scent(representing amber). It’s well done and reminds me of the best amber scent imo, Aumbre by Roxana Illuminated, which smells so rich, sweet resin dripping woods and natural (like resin right off a tree). It’s not listed here. I had a chance to compare this to Aumbre and Amber Sultan. This fragrance and Aumbre have the purest and strongest labdanum note. This has a slight dusty menthol note at one point that settles. Aumbre has a little more real fresh wood in it. Amber sultan has some extra dry notes with labdamun peeking through, but not the main show. Also, some similarity to calling all angels, but that one is a much heavier burning church incense vs dripping resins. Overall it’s linear but well done 8/10-smells so natural', 'I agree with all the positive reviews below, and don’t have the amber experience to expound upon them, but if you think you like ambergris you must a least sample this beast. I only thought I understood what it smelled like before I smelled the real thing here. Not for the faint of heart (like most of life’s greatest pleasures). A full bottle is coming as soon as I finish my 5ml sample.', ""my favorite amber. too bad fragrantica doesn't list the cist (labdanum) note that gives this the intensity to be a masterpiece."", '100 % Mystic Amber (Depot Male Tools, Italy)', ""Oh shittt. My bottle just arrived today and as openned the cap an opulent rich dark classic scent hit my nose. Its totally incensy and kinda dirty animalic accord accompanies it which amber gives a little sweetness to it to balance it. Its very high quality balenced and potent and needs to mention that its juice is so oilly better not to apply on cloths.  It is mature a little classic while it completely is accord with modern life so that it match with a mature suit and tie boss or manager of a company who is so confident and know his job well. All in all it is another masterwork by a legendary italian house that not resemble any other amber scent I'm loving and have plenty of them ."", ""first spray reaction: sweet, dirty and sticky resins and incense. really simple and high quality. i'm excited to see how it drys down. i love myrrh in perfumery and this is one of the best i've smelled so far. it's almost vanillic in sweetness with beautiful incense and resins bringing it back to earth"", ""Ambra Aurea is a nice enough incense/amber perfume, but it does read masculine to my nose. Why are so many perfumes' masculine now? Is it because the florals are becoming too expensive? There is vetiver and patchouli in everything, even in incense accords which should be frankincense and Myrrh. Those are there in this perfume, but they have been thinned out by the less expensive materials. This would be better if it had more resins and florals. It just doesn't captivate me. This does smell better in the dry down. But the start and mid of the fragrance is rather rough."", ""Simple, old-world kind of fragrance with very high-quality raw ingredients. Opens quite pungent- this must be the ambergris. It is really quite sticky and resinous. This is the thickest perfume I've had on the skin. The ambergris combined with the myrrh makes for a strong opening, and it dries down to reveal the incense. But that incense is combined with the funky ambergris the whole time, so this is not a quiet and subtle kind of incense fragrance. This is something that will get you attention, and may not be to everyone's liking because of how pungent it is. This is good for fragrance connoisseurs, for those who appreciate its quality and the natural ingredients used. It is a good way to experience and study those particular notes (e.g. I was very happy to experience the ambergris here.) This is a very mature and classy fragrance, more serious and formal, for colder weather."", ""I often struggle with amber: too sickly sweet, too sticky, too powdery, too... boring sometimes. Ambra Aurea, however, is what I long for when I think of amber: mysterious, smooth but rugged with a smoky note, enveloping on the coldest of days yet not quite friendly. Instead, there is a touch of loneliness and melancholy to Ambra Aurea: it's what you wear on a solitary walk through a frozen city in January when you've just broken up with someone, or when dejected walk through an ancient, quiet, dark forest with a fire burning in the distance. Magical precisely because it refuses to become quite cozy, I treasure my sample of this."", 'What an interesting scent- powerful, sweet, spicy, and very simple. Worth trying, and very versatile.', ""Profumum Roma delivers a big time sensuality ember with Ambra Aurea, a far-reaching and expansive wear that weighs heavily on Cistus oil and absolute at the top. How does cistus differ from labdanum, you ask? Well, both come from the Cistus ladanifer plant, also colloquially as Gum Rockrose (no relation to true rose). In fact, the family of Cistaceae is in the order Malvales, which is shared by hibiscus, mallow, Rose of Sharon, and hollyhock. This is evidenced in the appearance of the flowers of Cistus ladanifer, one can note the similarities. While labdanum extractions derive from the exudate of the plant itself, cistus essential oil and absolute is steam-distilled or solvent-extracted from the leaves themselves. Cistus is luscious, sweetly balsamic with brighter amber notes, whereas labdanum is much deeper, darker, leathery, nearly animalic. In Ambra Aurea, cistus is the star from the very opening through its dry down. This overdose is scintillating and when the myrrh fades in, there is this hypnotic intensity, with the myrrh's bitter, earthy, nearly medicinal qualities making it feel almost mysterious and cabalistic. There is almost a salty effect that makes for a delectable (and I would argue necessary) contrast to the sweetness. It's also worth noting that we don't really have so much a vanilla note here as we have the vanillic qualities of benzoin, shrouded in incense smoke and olibanum tears that unfurl further into the base. I detect what to my nose seems to be ambergris (actual ambergris, not ambroxan mind you), as in a tincture of the fabled material, which could account for the expansiveness and amplification of all elements. This is captivating amber in technicolor and stereo, larger in life and enveloping, more an experience than a mere donning of perfume."", ""This is literally a delicious amber, you actually wanna eat it xD  Very resinous and a beautiful but very strong amber scent, you're gonna get all the amber you want out of this one 8/10"", 'In my humble opinion, Ambra Aurea is THE reference Amber fragrance. Autumn has well and truly hit London and this has come alive. Salty ambergris, warm and resinous dry amber & smoke with minimal sweetness.  Nearly impossible to pick up in the UK these days, so I went to Rome. I would have travelled further for this. Stunning!', 'عطر ثقيل كل ما استطيع شمه هوة رائحه الدخان المستمر عطر مشمئز', 'Deep and resiney, equal parts myrrh and amber, and wonderfully basey scent. I have really enjoyed getting into the Profunum samples I was lucky to get. I\'m yet to find one that slaps me in the face and screams ""buy me!"", but they are ALL excellent. Definitely worth trying...', 'Soo i tried it today...I was hyped by some reviews and tought i could get my hands on it but it didnt go as i expected...When i sprayed it on my hand it opened up sooo stroong that i couldnt believe it. Its a best mode dusty smoky almost vintage kind of amber. I also do get some incense but bcs im a teenager it just doesnt fit me... I dont recommend this to someone young or someone that wants to smell young and casual...This is a dark smoky old smelling amber scent that projects like noones business and would fit someone older and more professional. It requires solphisticated outfit as well. I see it on someone pretty old and serious...However i need to mention that i truely apreciatte the smell of this and the more you smell it the more addiccted you become... This really is art and ofc i deffenetely dont recommend a blind buy of this one... Still a must try', 'Good lord idk who is hyping this perfume up, but this is disgusting. It was hate at first sniff. I love their perfume “Sorriso”, but I got this and had high expectations only to be let down. It smells like heavy smoke from a fire mixed with poop. This is 100% not a safe crowd pleasing perfume, so don’t wear this to a first date or a big event because there’s a good chance it will offend many people. I would also note that this is def a more ethnic smell (Indian/Middle Eastern), so maybe in those countries it’s considered nice, but where I’m from this would not be an appealing scent. Do not blind buy this and get a sample if for some reason you think you’ll like this.', 'Amber Aurea is focused on a cistus-based balsamic amber accord sweetened by benzoin and a touch of vanilla but I wouldn’t describe it as a sweet amber. Now cistus is an interesting material because it comes from the same plant from which labdanum is produced, cistus is the essential oil and labdanum is the absolute. To my nose, the amber accord here is paired with a prominent ambergris, it does smell like genuine ambergris in this fragrance. I also detect something reminiscent of Atlas Cedar as well as a touch of smoke and medicinal myrrh adding an incense feel to the scent. Now what makes this fragrance special in addition to balance and blending is the purity and the quality of the ingredients, the fragrance feels like a natural creation.', ""What a gorgeous, rich, amber. It's a little animalic and I can almost taste the salt on my tounge. When the initial topnotes are gone I get vanilla puff and I swear I smell chocolate in this - just a tiny little whiff - even though it's not listed. Actually the only amber I ever need, it's THAT good! Update: MMMMM!!! God damn!!! After wearing this today I'm even more in love. It is stellar in the cold of winter and wraps around you like a warm luxurious scarf. I absolutely smell cloves and nutmeg in here too. Full of surprises."", 'Sensational, brooding, a little salty and animalistic, smoky amber of the highest quality. Very high oil concentration - it fossilizes around atomizer :)  Beautiful, haunting and precious!  Ambient and mystical.', 'This is as close as Ambre Sultan as it could be!Unbelieveable.As soon i put it on my skin,i was amazed how similar they are.I own Ambre Sultan,so i think i can be relevant enough to judge it.Someone below mentioned that it’s not even close to Ambre Sultan??I was really shocked ,how someone can not detect certain similarity,something so obvious?I’m not going to descript,and give high praises,just want to mention similarities between two.Not to mention that AS is way way cheaper.', ""This is a lovely sandalwood and labdanum combo - salty, smoky, warm, even though sandalwood's unlisted, and reminiscent in a way of Trumper's Sandalwood, which I know I lot of people love, but which strikes me as harsh and simplistic (my bottle is sitting unused), and it's also slightly reminiscent of Tauer's L'air du desert marocain (which is of course gorgeous, and more complex). Should be tried, along with Olibanum and the amazing Patchouly from this house."", 'Absolutely spiffing ambergris scent! S Stunning incense, real ambergris, heavenly sweetness. Sweet, salty and smoky. What a trance. Bellissimo!', 'Amber, vanilla and incense. No more, no less. Fantastic scent that lasts and lasts. High quality, perfectly blended and full bottle worthy.', 'Attention lovers of amber! This is a huge, warm, deep and rich amber which starts off with an ethereal and alluring candied sweetness that fades in and out, teasing your senses for more. It transitions into an addictive, viscous, vanillic and spicy amber as it settles into the heart, powerful and confident, underscored by a beautiful subtle hint of ambergris and incense. After many many hours of absolute luxury, the fragrance settles into its base notes, the mineral saltiness of the ambergris is beautifully counterpointed by the incense, now darker and slightly smoky but with a shadow of sweetness.  There is also a flaky crystallization near the the atomizer which, like JoyJoy below said, is representative of it containing real ambergris, which is awesome! Not a safe blind buy as the slightly animalic undertones of the amber can be hard to appreciate for some. But stellar performance and beautifully luxurious scent.', 'If you are starting to get obsessed with perfumes, do yourself a favor and sample this one. I hated at a first, but now my nose understands it better. This is thick - actually a little sticky on your skin-, rich, sweet like honey, ""incensy"". the evolution on the skin is really beautiful. I now understand why ambergris is the base note of some many perfumes. Would I wear it or buy a full bottle? Probably not. But I am glad I now understand ambergris', ""This is Skunky! It has a Skunky Quality that ruins it for me! Thou i must say! Its Sticky! Reisinous! Ambery! Vanillic! Thick! Heavy! Longlasting!

I’m sure there’s real ambergris in here. I have a recent sample of this from Osswald & it gets that white sort of crystallization around the bottle that real ambergris does (I have 4 tiny bottles of different pure ambergris). This smells of amber & incense, warm and a little spicy & I think it must be the real ambergris that just makes it really special. I think I’m going to need a bottle of this.', 'I usually don\'t even like Ambergris... I tend to find it a bit funky and gross. But in this fragrance it\'s just really great. (According to the official site the amber note is in fact Ambergris, not just ""Amber"" as listed on this page.) This has a slightly boozy and sweet opening which sort of reminds me of a ginger ale cocktail or something. However within just a minute or two this initial vibe quickly evaporates (although that opening does last much longer on clothes) and the fragrance settles into being warm, dark, resinous, woody, cozy, slightly sweet in a sort of dry and powdery way... And also salty which makes it a bit animalic but not in a funky or gross way, more like a warm and slightly gamey kinda way. It doesn\'t smell like ""perfume"", really... Just like many other Profumum Roma fragrances, it feels natural, raw and rugged. I definitely see why some describe this as The Best Amber. It\'s very rich and possibly a bit challenging, but really smooths out as it dries down. In the far drydown, about 6-8 hours in, it almost gets a bit of a headshop incense kinda vibe as a skin scent, with a subtle vanilla peeking out. The longevity is amazing, it\'s one of very few fragrances that I can still clearly smell on my arm even after a full night\'s sleep. I would actually say that it just gets better and better the more it dries down. It\'s almost at its best the day after wearing it, when it sticks around as a subtle, resinous vanilla skin scent, especially on clothes where it just lasts forever. Definitely unisex, but the raw ruggedness probably makes it lean masculine. It would take a certain kind of woman to pull this off.', 'My holy grail amber and the midevile cousin of Ambre Fetiche.  Resinous, ancient, smokey, rich and sweet.  In my opinion nothing like Ambre Sultan, which has a creamy sandalwood note I can’t get past. Ambre Aurea is more pure and resinous - less spa experience more powerful elixir to command the spirits with.', 'Profumum Ambra Aurea did not come to play. This is seriously good stuff.  My top 5 ambers are: Ambra Aurea, Histoires de Parfums Ambre 114, Dior Mitzah, Hermès L’Ambre des Merveilles and Annick Goutal Ambre Fetiche (in no particular order). All of these are a bit similar in that they’re non-sweet, spicy, incense heavy amber accords (except for the Hermès which sweetens up a little bit). Ambra Aurea reminds me the most of Dior Mitzah because it’s spicy, dry and goth.  Wearing Ambra Aurea is like a religious experience because the myrrh and dry incense make me think of ancient temples, meditation and spirituality.  If I could add just a touch of vanilla to sweeten this I would; but I still love it with a passion just the way it is.  I tend to wear this mostly when I’m at home, during the winter. I think it’s too unusual for wearing to the office. It’s also not a feminine scent; I find it definitely unisex.  Profumum Roma is an excellent house. Ambre Aurea is a masterpiece that lasts for dayzz with leaping projection. 2-3 sprays are plenty.', 'This is my perfect amber: ambergris, incense and myrrh make this a rich, sticky and salty blend. It’s cozy, comforting, decadent and worth every penny. This is pretty linear in nature. The beauty, strength and longevity is astounding and will carry me through the whole day. I do really enjoy many other ambers out there, but somehow this one just rises to the top every time.', 'Ahhhhhh..... the best amber there is, like a creamy butter, luxurious, decadent, intoxicating and long lasting. Nothing compares. Totally worth the price. I have a second bottle in stock. The top fragrance in my collection. Unisex but for cooler weather. Definitely not a summer fragrance. A Masterpiece fragrance by Profumum Roma!', 'As good as an amber sent gets in my book. So many reviewers are spot on in thier descriptions below. Linear, salty and sweet at once, animalic and resinous. Pure joy when that is what I crave.', ""Smells just like my great aunts house that she regularly chain smoked in for 50 years along with heaps of toothache worthy sweetness layered on top.  Many have mentioned it smelling ancient and I couldn't agree more. Definitely distinctive and potent juice. I'd be careful wearing this out in public."", 'Very abstract scent Linear Not a compliment getter Straight amber Only for advanced noses Decant worthy but not FB worthy', 'Scent of antique temptations: scent of pleasure and warmth.  Opens with a brutish amber: sweet, faecal, vegetal, raw, carnal, almost gourmand, salty and smoked. Dirty vanilla beans and sticky labdanum. The note list may read simple but Ambra Aurea is far more complex than the note list suggests, the fragrance constantly shifting and changing. Evening in an ancient pagan temple somewhere on the Omani coast. Smoke curls from a censer loaded with incense and myrrh. A plump, rich vanilla bean and piece of ambergris, recently washed up on the nearby shoreline, have been added to the censer as offerings to forgotten gods. Flickering golden light and naked bodies entwined in the temple’s shadows.  The half-light of the next morning. The temple is empty and the incense, myrrh, vanilla bean and ambergris are gone. From the censer comes the scent of the finest chocolate, one that could only have been made by celestial means: the forgotten gods have accepted the offerings and given their worshippers something treasured in return. Every once in a while a fragrance comes along that broadens your olfactory horizons and quite simply amazes you. For me, possibly more than any other, Ambra Aurea (‘Golden Amber’) is a fragrance like that. I’m not sure if real ambergris was used in Ambra Aurea, but it doesn’t matter when a fragrance smells this good.', 'Not a compliment getter from girls. Not liked by most girls around me. There are a lot of better ambers out there for dates. Stay away from this one unless you like ambergris', 'One of my favs from my collection. Great spicy resinous linear amber. Others from the house did not hit the mark as much as this one.', ""I recently tested a sample of this after reading that it is a good reference for real ambergris.  I used about two sprays worth. The opening is like boozy vanilla but also spicy & musky  It's odd because it's not quite vanilla, but like another shade of vanilla with caramelized sugar, it's not cloying - it still smells natural. About 10-15 minutes in I recognized its main impression from a few other high end European perfumes, mostly stuff I've smelled from the Santa Maria Novella brand, the Italian house started by monks in the 1600s After an hour it gets MUCH deeper, the sweet boozy shade of vanilla becomes dark & inky with hints of pitch black tea & subtle smokey notes...  it's like smelling a sweet smokey ink pen. Sadly at this point the perfume became overbearing & started to give me a headache...  It's not a badly constructed perfume, it just doesn't agree with my physiology but overall I'm happy I tried it!"", ""This fragrance apparently focuses on the scent of real ambergris (aged whale vomit) in it, and apparently has 43% fragrance concentration (more than some extrait de parfums). As for the scent, the opening to my nose is extremely similar to Tobacco Oud by Tom Ford, while the drydown smells of a salty caramel with a hint of tobacco to my nose. The drydown gets a bit sweeter but still retains that salty, dark, resinous punch. Honestly, it's not the best amber in my opinion, but still very good. Very good is not enough to stay in my collection however, and I ended up selling it - particularly because of how strong the incense note in this is (and I'm not a huge fan of incense). 3.5/5"", ""A pure Amber with heavy incense/myrrh. I was fixated on finding a new perfume with incense as the primary note when I sniffed a sample of this one. The amber note is everything, it completes the incense and myrrh so perfectly here that it's ended my quest for an incense and I'm happy with this and only this for now. If you like a smoky, incense, sweet and very, very rich & thick amber then this will be your new favorite perfume. Longevity is fantastic, beyond a day of wearing and the sillage is a monster. Perfection."", 'Beautiful, smokey woodsey true amber. Rich and thick, like I like them. I can see why some have compared it to Molinard Ambre Lumiere, but it\'s less herbal than that. Definitely less herbal than Ambre Sultan, though the amber there is similar. I would say it\'s like a slightly less smoky, and slightly more soapy Ambre Absolute (ToFo). I think the ""soapy"" comes from the myrrh, that\'s always a challenging note for me. Feels rich and luxurious and definitely more on the sweet side (than say, HdP 114 which is similar amber to my nose otherwise.) I think if anyone loves this but wants a less pricey alternative, do smell Ambre Lumiere. It\'s a lot similar with a hint of Eucalyptus.', 'This is an absolutely beautiful scent. At first it smells like the most classic amber you could think of. In 10 mins the amber leaves room to a beautiful, soft, sweetened version of the church incense burnt in Catholic churches. This phase of the evolution is absolutely stunning. Much better than Ambre Sultan or Ambre Fetiche. Projection is good for the first 30 mins on me, but it fades pretty quickly. for the remaining 3 h it is perceivable if someone is very close (2-3 inches).', 'If you do not know what is the bitter scent, try this. I can smell just bitter myrrh and olibanum, which beats all. Strong dislike.', ""A dark, deep and smokey amber. Fortunately not of the super sweet and vanillic kind. I can see the ambergris element especially in the opening, its a little salty and sort of gooey, which is nicely contrasted by the dry smoky incense. It becomes softer and gentler after the first few hours, but it is still very tenacious. Pretty linear and simple, but in this case it's solid and smells very good so I don't mind very much.

The smell is linear and somewhat similar to the drydown of Tauer's l'Air du Desert Marocain. So if you like the drydown of l'Air but find the opening too spicy and strong, this might be perfect for you. The only problem I have is that if you have a light skin color, this leaves a yellow patch on your skin. Especially if you tend to apply often on the same area. The color stays for a long time and is difficult to wash off. Later I found out that the sample sprayer had totally clogged due to crystallized perfume. The perfume almost feels and smells like it is completely saturated with resins."", ""Not much to add to all these amazing reviews. This, along with TF AA are the two best Amber dominate fragrances ever made! Both are fairly similar. And both are THE BEST. It's raw, chewy, bow resin Amber.

Absolute masterpiece and one of the best fragrances in the world in MHO."", ""Like other reviewers have mentioned this is like Ambre Sultan minus the spices and herbs. I detect myrrh, amber, incense, and some vanilla. It is sweeter and more feminine than the other amber offering from this line, Fiore d'Ambra. Ambra Aurea is also, like Ambre Sultan, much more dense and syrupy than Fiore d'Ambra. This amber is perfect for those who find Ambre Sultan and/or Fiore d'Ambra either too difficult to wear or too masculine. This perfume is definitely made for the colder months. However, sillage and longevity are surprisingly moderate, I expected something much bolder at this price point. Strong like for me.

As it warms on the skin, the amber starts to shine through, rich and sweet and warm. I often find myrrh can be quite sharp, but the balance of this with the amber is perfect – smoky, sharp, rich and sweet. I had to laugh – I gave my husband a sniff of this after I’d put it on, and asked him what he picked up from it. He said bacon and honey. Which I guess means he got the smoky incense and sweetness from the amber ☺ This is a stunning amber scent, and definitely full-bottle-worthy. Big thanks to purecaramel for the sample.', ""I'm really starting to love this fragrance. First off, I am a huge amber lover so I had to try this one after reading all the reviews. At the opening...this is sooo boozy like scotch whiskey. Very rich and smokey with a vanilla finish. As it dries down there is still lots of oud, wood and smoke. I also get a leathery scent close to the skin. All with the familiar amber lilting and glowing in the background. There is definitely a heavy ambroxan note in this, which I really like, as it balances out the sweetness of the vanilla and spice.  One thing I found remarkable about this perfume is the skin scent is different from the sillage that wafts around you. I applied to my wrists and throughout the day I got mostly a beautiful spicey (cinnamon) vanilla with a nutty back note. Other times I caught leather and smoke. Really beautiful and complex fragrance all the way to the finish. It lasts a long time 6+ hours and has moderate to large sillage cloud that emanates around you in a comforting way all day."", ""Love at first sniff. So rich, spicy, resinous...One of my most favorite ambers.  What I like the most about it, is it's harmony and balance. It's sweet but not to much, smoky, spicy, balsamic, resinous,warm, sensual... Its seems simple but it's not, it's very faceted.  When I wear it I feel comfy, sexy and strong at the same time. Some believe it's too heavy, but on my skin it just melts down and is in complete harmony with my own scent.  And its longevity is great! Over 14 hours."", '6/10', 'The more I wear this fragrance, the more I like it. Smokey and incense in a nice way. Pure quality and well worth the extra $$. You will be spoiled as all others will seem inferior. Strong sillage and longevity. One of my new favorites...you will not be disappointed unless you were expecting a fruity or sweet fragrance. One of the best from this quality fragrance house.', '""Best Organic Amber Fragrance"" Profumum Roma is what I call the quintessential of a no nonsense house.  Fragrances from this house don\'t have middle and base notes. There are only 2-3 top notes that are easily detectable. However, they are executed in a simple yet elusive and perfectionist manner.  If Amouage Opus VI is the most sophisticated amber based fragrance, Ambra Aurea is the most raw and organic amber fragrance in the business. Unlike most amber fragrances that are mixed with vanilla, Ambra Aurea is mixed with smoke and has a dark and earthy element to it. It reminds me of handpicking a large chunk of amber from nature in a cold day and placing it among wood branches in a woody fireplace. Ahhh, it is so beautiful.  It glows for hours and hours and keeps getting better and riper with time.  Apply no more than two sprays. I applied three sprays at 6:30 am when I left the home and was called a French whore at least three times during the day. The last of which was at 3:15 pm.  This thing is even stronger than Amouage Interlude in some ways.  It is really powerful with nuclear projection and is pungent enough to fill a large conference or ballroom. You will get noticed, and heads will be turned to say the list.  The facial expressions of my coworker when he walked in my cubicle to ask a few questions but instead was exposed to the powerful Ambra Aurea will last in my mind for a long time. This is a dragon, a beast, but also a beast with a good heart. Oh God, I love this fragrance <3. Amra Auera is expensive, but totally worth the money. If you are an amber lover, you must add Ambra Aurea to your collection. 10/10 for a world class fragrance.', 'در ابتدا بوی تاپ نوت خوبی نداره. ولی هر چی از عمر عطر میگذره خوش بوتر میشه. بوی کهربا در این عطر خیلی کم شیرینه. بوی نت میانی در ابتدا میر هست که یه نوع صمغ هست. بعد بوی بخور به تدریج زیاد میشه ابتدا آدم فکر میکنه که اصلا عطر خوبی نیست. ولی صبر کنید. هر چه نتهای عطر به جلو پیش میره؛ مثل یه غنچه گل که شکوفا میشه؛ این عطر هم تکامل پیدا میکنه و واقعا خوش بو میشه. مثل عطرهای برند آمواج بوی بخور یا میر بسیار شدیدی نداره بلکه کاملا کنترل شده و در حد کماله At first, the top note smell is not good. But as the life of the perfume passes, it gets better. The smell of amber in this perfume is not very sweet. The smell of the middle note at the beginning is myrrh, which is a type of gum. Then the smell of incense gradually increases At first, one thinks that it is not a good perfume at all. But wait. As the notes of the perfume move forward; like a flower bud that blooms; This perfume also evolves and smells really good. Like Amvaj brand perfumes, it does not have a very strong smell of incense or myrrh, but it is completely controlled and perfect.', ""Such a beautiful amber, so good. I love this gorgeous thing. Amber amber amber. I adore it, it's beautiful."", 'Wow damn. Ambra Aurea is a naughty little minx. A balsamic and tangy amber with only a little powdery feel. Light smoke in the background and hints of a dirty vanilla like Musc Ravegeur.  The amber isn\'t too sweet either. It\'s a nice balance and a very memorable scent. Stays fairly linear with more vanilla and resin coming out over time.  If you like tangy bittersweet amber scents: this might be a ""must have"". Scent: 9/10 I\'ve been searching for a standout amber and this is it for me.  Longevity: 6/10 I get a consistent six hours of ise out of this-and virtually all Profumum compositions. The folks claiming 24 hours are either extremely lucky or overstating.  Projection: 8/10 for the first 45 minutes. Really fills up a room. After an hour and a half Id say still a solid 5/10 and by hour 5 it\'s mostly a skin scent.  Sillage: 8/10 for the forst 20-30 minutes. By hour 2 it\'s a small train...4/10 and by hour 4 it\'s virtually gone and leaves no detectable train.  Would I buy a full bottle? It\'s my next purchase. Hell yes.', ""I wanted to Profumum Ambra Aurea due the reception it's received online as well as the note listings, as well as the trend that amber and resins have become some my favorite notes in the last year or so, and it does not disappoint. It's not the sweetest amber fragrance out that, rendered spicier by incense and myrrh, but mainly, it's just a mixture of these three notes per the breakdown. I get almost a psuedo fire note (as in By Kilian Light My Fire), hence classifying this as a wee bit spicy, not just balsamic and smoky. There's not much evolution, though it starts out a little sharper and dries down a little smoother, as one might expect. Performance is strong, like most Profumum entries, at least affirming the $250-for-100ml price (available only at Luckyscent and Osswald in the US), so it's easier to stomach this as mainly a cold weather option for nights. It can work formally, and probably casually, though I doubt I'd wear it casually. Definitely among the best amber-dominant fragrances I've ever tried, along the lines of Tom Ford Amber Absolute, By Kilian Amber Oud, Le Labo Benjoin 19, and Tauerville Amber Flash. 8 out of 10"", ""Full disclosure: this review is based on a sample. That out of the way, I have to say that this scent is special. It's the first fragrance I have ever worn, where I could smell all of the notes listed, and others. What a beautiful interplay between the incense and the amber! Although vanilla is not listed as one of the notes, I detect it in the dry-down. I dabbed it on more than 12 hours ago, and can still smell it, so the longevity seems to be good. Gosh, I want a full bottle."", ""Ambra Aurea from Profumum Roma is very very bad for me. I read the reviews of this perfume here and on Basenotes. I watched the reviews by the most excellent mrzayas81 and Scentrifugal Force on YouTube. Then I looked up on line where Ambra Aurea is being sold. I found out that in my neighborhood in NYC is a store called Osswald on West Broadway and Canal (Beautiful store and great sales associates). They are one of the three sellers of Profumum Roma perfumes in the US. I sampled AA on paper and on my skin. They gave me a sample and BONG!!! I LOVE it, I am hooked! Ambra Aurea is a simple scent that packs a wallop! It's amber, incense and myrrh. But it's more than that. It's sweet, smokey, caramel-ish, and woody. There's even an intriguing metallic edge to Ambra Aurea that is wild. It gets into your head. All of Profumum Roma's fragrances have serious longevity and sillage. Everything that I have heard and read about Profumum Roma is true. These perfumes last and last, I was smelling it in my sleep last night - very nice. Profumum Roma uses something like 46% of perfume oil in their scents. Even though they call it Eau De Parfum it's more like an extrait concentration. Profumum's fragrances are all $250.00 and they only come in a 3.4 fl oz. size. A couple of their fragrances are slightly higher in price. As I said, this is bad for me because I love strong scents that last and Profumum has about 30 of them. Right now I can only speak for Ambra Aurea, I have only sampled about three other Profumum Roma's scents, but I can say they are worth it. Beautiful scents, and you don't have to use too much. I look forward to a nice relationship with Profumum Roma and their other amazing scents. Ambra Aurea is everything I want in an amber based scent, it's subtle and beautiful. Which one will I choose for my next purchase?"", ""Yep, amber. A lot like Ambre Sultan, but even more just straight-up pleasant amber, without that metallic edge of perfuminess that Sultan had for me. Potent, wafts nicely. As long as I apply lightly, I really like its sweetness, like vanilla extract in the bottle; not over-sweet but pleasantly rich. I have a sample and it'll last me a while, and I probably wouldn’t spring for a full bottle at that price, but it is good. Definitely worth a try for hardcore amber fans. And if you're not an amber fan, there is no reason at all to try this."", 'If you love amber,you have to try this one. Very rich and warm.Bitter and sweet at the same time. It is similar to Ambre Sultan,witch is more arabic. This one is more ""baroque"". And it is very longlasting. I love it.', ""Soothing, contemplative amber, golden indeed.  Opening note of herbal liquer - a la Jaegermeister - is the thinnest note of the composition - stands out only at the beginning and with time it melts into the golden amber, softly interwining with rest of the notes till the drydown. AA is a spectatular blend, rich, deep but not heavy, very enjoyable. I detected no sweetness at all, still it's one of the rare ambers I can wear without fatigue. Furthermore, I was surprised the extent to which vintage Youth Dew I used to have is similar to Ambra Aurea; starting from dark brown almost scary-looking liquid that may have lost its sharpness/top notes due to age, but nevertheless it was a rich, golden amber drowned in incense, spice and lots of powder - only now to realize this 20-something year old Estee Lauder I swapped away so recklessly was simply spectacular! It lacked the specific AA's opening herbal accent, but on the other hand was a sillage/longevity beast with more complexity than Ambra Aurea...  Ambra Aurea or vintage Youth Dew - both fantastic fragrances, each in their own price category."", 'Wow, the warmest frankincense I have smelled outside of Aftelier\'s ""Ancient Resins"" hair and body oil. Very lush, smooth, regal. There is a carmelized sugary scent that calms the bright and medicinal harshness that I often find in myrrh. My skin tends to enhance smoky scents, I like that with this perfume the smoky/animalistic depth is subtle rather than too masculine. I\'m sure this would be wonderful on either gender! I agree that the usual incense in this perfume seems more exotic rather than churchlike. The amber is less powdery, and more earthy than the many others I have sampled. Maybe I am just drawn to these more unisex perfumes.... But this doesn\'t seems overwhelming in silage to me at all.', 'Finishes as a woody amber - yes.  But to me, it initially has a scent of blown out match mixed with that of a burnt marshmallow.  Still a pleasant fragrance overall', 'Scent - pure thick, sticky amber. Season/Time of Day - I prefer to use this one in the colder months, day or night. Projection - I did get noticed, it garners compliments.  Longevity - I get 24hrs consistently.', 'This smells identical to the candles lit by the devoted in churches as they pray for loved ones. Very waxy, sweetened,smoky amber....heavy on warmth, and a slight hint of spice. I actually love that smell/association, but the issue here is that this fragrance is as heavy as hyper intelligent elephants playing Pantera\'s greatest hits. Ambra Aurea is a HUGE projection/sillage beast. This scent could fill stadiums, never mind elevators. It also is insanely long lasting. One small dab on my left wrist, created a month of Sundays in every room I entered for the next 24 or so hours. What is enjoyable in smaller, less beastly doses quickly wears out its welcome at chemical weapon concentration.  Hour 1 was pleasant.  Hour 3 was a bit much.  Hour 6 I had the start of a splitting headache. By hour 12 I was calculating how much scrubbing my skin could stand before I hit bones underneath. At hour 24, I wondered if scrubbing myself raw would only reveal that even my bones reeked of Ambra Aurea. I don\'t hate this, but it is impossible for me to wear in its current brute force formulation. This fragrance is just about the definition of ""too much of a good thing"".', 'This is really a great mysterious fragrance, I often sample it, but I never buy a full bottle because I can not figure out when to wear it. Outstanding sillage and longevity.', ""Read sweetnspicey's review below and you will understand exactly what this elixir is all about. She's left no words behind that could or should be written about Ambra Aurea. Such a grand review. I want to second every word. This is an experience, rather than a fragrance worn. Is it beautiful? Yes. Is it powerful? Indeed. To me, it is ancient in presence, fit for a pharaoh or his queen. In my next life, I'll get a bottle, as it is a pricey potion. But absolutely worth it."", ""The most exquisite amber perfume I have encountered to date. If you are familiar with Tom Ford's Amber Absolute, you have a vague idea of what this perfume smells like--a high-quality woody amber. Oh but there is so much more to this one [rubbing hands together mischievously]. The woody amber forms only the base on top of which sits an undeniably natural note of precious, increasingly rare, ambergris. The ambergris here reminds me so much of that which is used in Guerlain's Encens Mythique d'Orient--a whale's breath, shimmering sea water on a dancing whales back. It is sweet, ethereal, translucent, and salty enough to cause one to salivate.  Adding another twist to this already exquisite creation, the ambergris smells as if it has been smoked or partially burned (I understand ancient Egyptians burned ambergris as incense). The whole concoction is like a smooth, woody amber mixed with roasted vanilla salt water taffy. It is just on the cusp of being gourmand, but the ambergris' slightly animalic scent of cured feces makes it entirely inedible. At least I hope that sounds unappetizing to most people! This really is an amber masterpiece. It is highly recommended for amber lovers, particularly those who wish to become more familiar with the scent of ambergris in particular. Ford's amber, although good at what it set out to accomplish, IMHO cannot hold a candle to this."", 'It opens with the spiciness of cinnamon and clove. I am not good at dissecting perfumes but I am instantly transported to India and Nepal, where I have lived. It smells like a Hindu temple - incense and smoky. And dusty. I think of dusty streets, soft cotton sarees and a perfume that covers malodours. Unisex. I\'ve asked my family members to comment and they each said, ""Hmm, it\'s okay."" It\'s a heavy perfume with the potential to trigger a migraine of an a bad day. Do I love it - not quite, but liking it more and more.', ""Sorry but no. This is too strong for me, this is raw amber pure and simple and for me that is a no-no. I mean, I must give credit to Profumum for having created the most realistic amber I have ever smelled but no thanks. I like amber when it is combined with something else, like the tobacco-amber combo in Baldessarini Ambre or in many of Thierry Mugler's fragrances. Raw amber has a stinky urine-like odor, its not clean nor fresh and instead of attracting people you might be doing the opposite. It reminds me of Tom Ford's Amber Absolute and the first thing that came to my mind when I smelled that was a Middle Eastern or Indian merchant. I have noticed many Profumum fragrances are very simple in composition: Amber is amber, Patchouli is patchouli, Olibanum is olibanum, Arso is pine... Out of all of these, Arso is the only one I can tolerate. Update: Compared to Tom Ford's Amber Absolute, TF is more herbal and earthy, unequivocally masculine. This one is more sweet and more... amberly? Anyway I prefer this one over TF if I had to choose between these two, it's just more alluring and niche smelling."", 'Fantastic. Smells just like a chunk of real amber burning on a coal.', 'Sharp, spicy amber. Not too innovative, reminds me of some classical amber fragrances. I only like the smell of the final dry-down stage on my clothes.', ""Before I smelled this bad boy, to me SL ambre sultan was the best amber I had ever smelled, but after smelling this I've changed my opinion. I don't know if amber could be done any better. The reason why I prefer this one over ambre sultan is because its sweeter in the dry down and has a bit more sexiness to it. They both are staple frags if u must own an amber scent but when I am done with ambre sultan I will be purchasing a fb of this! 8.5/10 Update: Purchased a fb, and I must say its hard not to wear this everytime I reach for a scent bc its so addictive and last forever.

Ambra Aurea is extremely long lasting (two intoxicating full days from a vile sample) which makes it worth every cent if not a great deal. I sit in a three foot barrier of perfection, and this particular fragrance plays tricks on me. Just when I think Ambra Aurea is fading it just intensifies. This continues through the long dry down, kind of like taking some high grade acid and thinking your trip is over, only to be fooled repeatedly by the next wave of deep thoughts and hallucinations. ;)  Profumum is a house that means business, and is worth checking out. 10/10 Patchouly is next on my list from this house...', 'عطر عنبري بسيط(عنبر كهرمان + قرنفل) وليس معقد واضح المعالم بالشكل الذي يجعك تتخذ قرارك ربما مباشر بالاهمتام به او نبذه، عطر شرقي بامتياز عطر يذكر بالاجداد وروائحهم الجميلة. ودائما ميكون للقرنفل دور في ذلك :) العنبر هنا هو بطل البداية ولكن قدم بشكل جميل من خلال المره ولكن ليس بصورتها الواضحة بجانب شعور بتواجد رائحه بخورية ناعمة ربما رائحة البخور سواء اللباني او غيره ، لا ادري وكاني اشعر أيضاً بتواجد الفانيلا وهو أمر طبيعي فدائما العنبر الكهرماني يوضف بالعطور عن طريق مزج عدة مكونات مع بعض لتسجيد العنبر ومن ضمنها الفانيلا التي شعرت بها سلفاً والبنزيون كلك وشي من الفرنقل. طبعا العطر لا اجده متفرداً بشكل كبير قد تلمح في جوانب من عطر عنبر سلطان كلك العطور التي تشابهة عنبر سطلان . عطر متأثر جدا بأسلوب وتكنيك العطور العنبرية التي سبقته جمال الرائحة  8/10 تفرد الرائحة /4/10 الثبات والفوحان لم يختر بعد  هل انصح بالتجربة نعم طالما وصلت  لاتنس تستغفر لاتنس تذكر ربك  لاتنس تصلي على نبيك.', ""Lots of gushing and praise among the reviews here and do you know what? I'm going to join in! This is simply one of (If not 'the') best amber scents I've ever tried.  Stunning!!! It's absolutely divine the first time I tried it several months ago I fell in love instantly Ambra Aurea is incredible. Upon reapplying today It has confirmed my initial feelings. It doesn't seem to develop like any amber I've come across but rather the constant and complex amber accord is so multi faceted it changes under your nose reverting from dusty libary, to ancient incense to sweetness and creamy vanilla then labdanunm and myrrh then back around again. This one is not as sweet as Fiori d'Ambra which I also thought was excellent quality but more floral and sweet. The quality is evident here and I've a real love of amber fragrances and this has an undeniable purity about it. Love it!"", ""@Colin Maillard no offense, after reading your review, I can't imagine that you didn't have a tainted sample or even a mislabeled one. A chypre with camphor, herbal facets reminiscent of SL's Amber Sultan and 'quite short longevity' frankly sounds nothing like this fragrance. :/"", ""Intense smoked amber, served on a gold platter with a touch of vanilla, and heat. Ambra Aurea is one of my favorite amber fragrances and with good reason- it's simply remarkable! If you love amber, you cannot pass this up. It's sooo good!"", ""I guess I'll throw my personal experience on the heap. I'm really not getting where people pull the word 'sweet' from in relation to this scent. Yes, it has a mild sweet undertone. It is not, however, sweet. Again, this is on my skin but I'll throw out there that I have a chemistry that typically amps up sweetness, so...  This is a very sunny, radiant, salty amber with a liberal dose of charred incense. I absolutely agree with Eos with their pinging of piney frankincense. This is the note that sticks out to me from beginning to end with Ambra Aurea; Set against that salty accord (which I somehow doubt is true ambergris), myrrh, and labdanum, and finished with a faint, abstract pinch of vanilla.  All-in-all this is a bit dry for my taste; I think that I could have enjoyed it more if it had a bit more sweetness to it. That same sunny radiance that gives it the moniker Aurea seems liable to induce a drought in my book and I can't help but feel I would tire of it quickly as it left me parched and blinded by light. In my humble opinion the vanilla could have been a tinge stronger or perhaps a mild fruity undertone could have been used but what do I know?  You might have come for the amber, and amber you will get, but you can't appreciate this and not like incense notes. It's not unpleasant, but I don't love it. Afterword 10-19-14: Well here I am coming back to sample this beauty and I'm liking it a lot more than I remember. I'm also picking up more sweetness than I was before. When I initially tested this I was on an amber testing spree and so I'm thinking that I had a bad case of olfactory fatigue. Everything else is as I remember with that dusty effect a-la-Amouage Opus VIII but the notes are very much in harmony. I still don't know if I would tire of this because there is something I can't put my finger on that keeps me from loving it. I can, however, see the unique charm that makes it so different from other ambers and worth the spend for some. (It screams quality.)"", ""An amber for the gods. AA is one of my top 5 favorite amber frags.  My reviews somehow always end up being novellas, but I will keep this short, sweet and to the point. Ambra Aurea is deep, resinous, mysterious, dark and ever so provoking. I love the juxtaposition of the smokey yet slightly sweet quality AA has to offer. There's something so alluring about this frag that my I find my appetite insatiable for it. Beautifully rich and dense but also inviting and warm. The epitome of a cold winters night frag. Yes it's pricey, but some times you just have to splurge a bit (if it's worth it) and Ambra Aurea is sooooooo worth it. But fear not, a sample can help cure the raging desire for this compelling composition. Whisper *luckyscent* whisper. Do I love/recommend this ? Comeon...must I scream to the heavens....YES! ;)"", 'Gorgeous perfume ! I am absolutely smitten with Ambra Aura. Admitted, I am a huge fan of amber scents. I had Amber Absolute in my collection but sold it as I found it too cloying. I had Ambre d´Orient in my collection but sold it as it is too similar to Ambre Sultan (which I love).  I love Ambre Fetiche by Annick Goutal.  Many amber scents have crossed my path but only a few really have made my day. Ambra Aurea is one of them. It is thick, dense, demanding but at the same time gives me comfort and the feeling of coming home. Smoky resins with a patchouli-vanilla background. In fact, I recognized some of Profvmvm Roma´s Patchouly here, it is subtle but it is there. If you do not like patchouli in general then I believe Ambrea Aurea might not be for you as well. In my humble opinion patch goes great with resinous scents and vanilla takes away some of the edginess that smoky resins often show.  Speaking of a Profvmvm Roma perfume we do not need to discuss longevity and sillage much. Their scents are bombs and should be applied with a light hand...but you will be able to enjoy their scents for many many hours, if not for a whole day.  The scent is quite linear, there is not much development which I like nonetheless, I am not much into scents that change every hour.  @Taskphorce : I would like to disagree with you. I believe that if someone is into Amber Absolute or similarly resinous scents (i.e. Ambre Fetiche) this might be a hit. I used to wear Amber Absolute but find Ambra Aurea slightly more wearable. A little bit :-) Unfortunately, this brand is not so easy to find in online shops but they are definitely worth a sniff. As others already have noticed : I cannot understand as well why Profvmvm Roma is not known more amongst perfume lovers. I would love to visit their boutique in bella Roma !', 'Terrible amber deodorant for car. Awful.', 'The house of Profvmvm Roma. The company that uses ""V"" instead of ""U"". It\'s an Italian thing. Jumping into the actual scent: On my skin, Ambra Aurea transitions from sweet to smoke to sweet. Once applied, don\'t expect for this perfume to call it quits anytime soon. It lasts and lasts. When applied, you will be greeted with a salty/vanilla-like amber that smells pretty close to Nabisco\'s Vanilla Wafers toppled onto a Mesquite Kingsford Charcoal Grill. This is a warm rich fragrance that\'s undoubtedly created for your October\'s, November\'s and December\'s. Even with all the sweet mentions, it\'s kind of hard for me to label this as a gourmand. The myrhh is sinisterly dark and the smoke is loud(until you reach the 10+ hour mark). As with most Profumom creations, they\'re not gonna charm you with a ""note parade"". The magic is created with only a few notes. Impressive.', ""After Profumi Del Forte's Ambra Mediterrana this has to be one of the greatest and most sublime and richest Ambergris driven amber fragrance I've ever smelt. A lot a of people complain about the price, but I've heard on good authority that Ambra Aurea is stronger than most normal perfume extraits. For the $240 you are getting 100ml of parfum with a staggering concentration of 46% which is higher than most extraits available in the market! So stop complaining and buy a bottle! :-P I will not discuss too much about the notes or on AA's smell profile as others have faithfully and eloquently discussed it already here. However I will write about its physical properties..... Its wonderful on its own but also can easily be layered with other fragrances just do not be too trigger happy.....believe me when I say one squirt should suffice. Its one of those fragrances to me where little is more interms of the effects it portrays over the hours on its own or with other fragrances. Another reason to control your trigger finger is that AA lasts a considerable amount of time on skin and especially on clothing........overnight on skin, a week or more on clothing. :-)"", ""My Holy Grail of amber perfumes.  Ambra Aurea opens with an aggressive piney olibanum incense note and fades to a faintly spicey, salty, smokey amber. It smells like a real ambergris note (not claiming it's real, just saying it smells like it to me) is used in addition to the labdanum, vanilla, olibanum and myrrh. In my opinion this is NOT an overly vanillic fragrance, its much more balanced than that. Myrrh shows up in the heart of the composition and adds to its subtle complexity. True to its name, this amber fragrance radiates an aura of warmth and mystery.

Of course it is matter of taste whether you like natural and deep amber or not but at least this fragrance is worth to try. I found description of AA on one webpage where author tried to imagine how smells the houses of ancient fighters like Beowulf’s for example. She compares AA to the smell of warm woods, fire and leathery clothes the people have been dressed that time. This is just perfect description.', 'Mmmmm … labdanum and labdanum and more labdanum!

The vanilla-amber combination lasted the entire day, both on the skin and in the sillage. This is yet another decant-worthy amber.

And during the first half an hour, it did live up to them. I've been searching for the perfect amber so long, and the dark, dry, dusty and understated amber this pretended to be for a while came surprisingly close. No vanilla, and even better, no sweetness in sight! Just what I wanted. Then it all went wrong. Not only did the dreaded vanilla show up, it completely took over, the scent got a lot sweeter and by the end of the first hour was nothing more than an average, albeit pretty vanilla scent with a light touch of amber.

This really is an amber masterpiece. It is highly recommended for amber lovers, particularly those who wish to become more familiar with the scent of ambergris in particular.

This is a warm rich fragrance that\'s undoubtedly created for your October\'s, November\'s and December\'s. Even with all the sweet mentions, it\'s kind of hard for me to label this as a gourmand.

Both are fairly similar. And both are THE BEST. It's raw, chewy, bow resin Amber. Not quite as sweet as TF AA, but every bit as good or possibly better. Also very similar to SL Ambre Sultan minus the vegetal/herb note. Absolute masterpiece and one of the best fragrances in the world in MHO."", ""Ambra Aurea opens with a strong smokey scent, with notes of tobacco and leather. For me, this combination is a musty old antique store or a library with ancient decaying leather bound books. This can be off-putting at first, but becomes deeply intriguing. After some wear, the sweetness of vanilla comes through. It takes me back to my father's smokey bee boxes with their honey-filled wax frames. In the end, the harsh musty smell dissipates almost completely. Leaving you with a playful cream soda sweetness. This is among the finest amber fragrances on the market."", ""Rich, bitter, heavy, thick. This is no sweet young thing; this is raunchy, feral, sweaty almost fecal amber.

Demanded to know the name and for me to write it down. Me? I thought it was fine. As a Jasmine lover I'd thought it would delight me. It kinda did? Not to the extent I'd like. Top notes kinda reminded me of poop when I'm high? Probably because the indoles mixing with the oreos I just ate in my nose. Which is a shame, I love Lush's Lust which is also heavy on the indoles, but there it's mixed with something sweet that balances them out and makes them heady instead of distracting and the top notes don't seem to have something that can adequately balance out the indoles. I'm beginning to think I'm just not a heavy white floral fan. HOWEVER once you get past the thick indoles, it is delightful. I can see why my mom loves it a lot. I don't see why there's honey notes--I smelled nothing of that. Ah well. The quest to find more jasmine scents for me continues. I must understand jasmine, for she is my lover and I wish to commit to knowing her fully. EDIT: Now that it has been a few minutes, it settles into a pleasant sweet floralness I really like. Aside from the thick indoles, this is a good scent. I can see why people like it so much. Perhaps I have been too harsh on it."", ""yesterday my best friend gave me freshly picked jasmine from her garden. the opening of this fragrance is the most perfectly photorealistic bloomed jasmine sambac scent. not jasmine buds. not sun-soaked, wilted jasmine. fully bloomed and bright jasmine. it's an intense scent, that i concede is not for everyone. but god it is addictive.  after a while, the jasmine begins to succumb to the honey and grenadine, making this smell more potion-like and less like a pure jasmine. i have to applaud the purity of the jasmine in the beginning. i've become used to scrubbed down, overly-clean jasmine notes (or worse, jasmine tea notes) and it's so refreshing to see a fragrance allow jasmine to have a spotlight on it's own."", 'If the opening was eternal I would live and die in this.

There are a lot of jasmine bushes in my neighborhood and A La Nuit smells very true to life. The balance is exactly right; it’s sweetly swooning, but not cloying.

Jasmine is one of the few flowers which needs no adornment in perfume; and A La Nuit is pretty much the perfect soliflore to showcase it. It’s pearly and glimmering.', ""Got a chance to sniff this side by side with Diptyque Olene and I didn't know if I liked A La Nuit better. This is heavy on the indole and seems to drag other notes down in the beginning. However, the dry down is amazing and it projects much stronger.

I've yet to smell any other jasmine perfume that could come even close to the real thing. Since I've had it, I'm bearing a curse of comparing all of them to A La Nuit. No replacement has been found yet. It's intense, very easy to overspray. Don't think it's headache inducing if you don't overspray it - I would've noticed. But if you do, I think it could be, potentially. For this? Worth risking in my opinion. Just to say it again: A La Nuit is NOT DISCONTINUED.

I imagine that this garden leads up to an old victorian mansion of slightly crumbling brick, barely visible from the outside due to tall overgrown hedges that haven\'t been trimmed in over a century, casting a gloom over the whole courtyard even in bright daylight. the interior is cobwebby with cold marble floors, but occasionally there are slight upkickings of dust as if someone were roaming the halls — the village people say it\'s haunted.  when the scent of jasmine draws near, you know the spirit is close behind. you meet her in the garden at midnight. the shadows cast by the surrounding jasmine bushes are a deep indigo beneath blue moonlight. she still has last night\'s sweat clinging to her skin, like remnants of heat that linger from the previous day, until the flowers release their passionate petals and open themselves to the night.', ""Simply put, the greatest jasmine perfume I've ever encountered."", 'I have now resumed my relationship with Serge Lutens perfume house . In the past, the samples I had tried adorned the fragrances with way too many spices, hard hitting or resinous notes or edgy , quirky notes for faint hearted me . I just couldn’t pull them off despite appreciating their complexity , craftsmanship and uniqueness .  I , then found in the Serge Lutens perfume house, a group of simpler and less in your face florals to which I have now amassed 8 bottles . I believe there is a market for those who love his workmanship and quality ingredients but prefer more wearable perfumes. Simplicity done perfectly is outstanding in itself . 💓 Anyway, now here I am , trying the original samples that put me off years ago. I am giving A La Nuit another go.  I am trying not to let the benzoin, grenadine and cloves notes hinder a positive decision. Besides, I am a-white floral lover and A La Nuit has always been talked about . I’m just hoping I don’t get indolic, cat piss, fecal or baby’s nappy kind of Jasmine that some reviewers have complained of . A La Nuit , starts with intensive Jasmine notes, mixed with the benzoin base. The Jasmine is very heady and indolic but not overblown as the green notes keep it fresh and light . The combination of the honey and the faint musk give the green notes a soapier feel.  After 30 mins , the Jasmine softens . I’m glad I didn’t get cloves or the grenadine notes.  This does reminds me a touch of Clair Obscur by Keiko Mecheri in the opening notes . I own but rarely use due to its linear , indolic Jasmine . However , A La Nuit is sweeter, soapier and fresher after the initial heady blast and that is so my cup of tea.  I like and appreciate A La Nuit after the heady Jasmine notes have subsided. As with a lot SL’s fragrances I own , the initial opening notes are explosive in intensity - sometimes all notes all at once . Quite deceiving when first sampling .  With A La Nuit , I’m glad I waited after the indoles merged and dissipated , this is the stage of the perfume that I like especially with the soapy , green notes . Being in the bell jar bottle range it is pricier and very hard to purchase in Australia so I’ll have to buy it in Paris next year . Yes , it’s bottle worthy .', 'Pulled my original 2000 bottle out this afternoon after an incredibly stressful day, sprayed it on and what a joy! Sweet and green and so uplifting. Absolutely the best juicy jasmine out there. Opulent, comforting. Thanks, Serge Lutens, I needed it today. Lasts forever on me, but skin chemistry is half the battle with any perfume.', 'For a start, trying to find a full bottle of this has been difficult - not sure if this is being discontinued or there are stock issues but hardly anywhere in the UK has it so when I found it I thought I’d struck gold. I’ve been on the hunt for the most accurate smelling jasmine and I’ve yet to come across a fragrance that does. Like others have said, it comes close but it’s just not like the flower (even the blooms at night). That said it is a lovely, pleasant and feminine fragrance. The longevity on my skin is only around 6-7 hours which is a let down. On the whole I don’t regret searching high and low for this but instead of it being this incredible Jasmine fragrance I was hoping for it’s more ‘meh’. This will probably end up being my day to day spring/ summer fragrance.', '337 I was conflicted about this one, as I’m not a fan of that hippy shop stinky variety of jasmine used in fragrances, which is all I’ve mostly experienced. Fortunately, while I can smell a soapy jasmine, the kind used in nice soaps, it’s not the head shop type which scents incense and oils. This is very fresh. Though I’ve smelled many varieties of jasmine vines, this one is not familiar to me. It smells more like lilac, white lilies, LOV, cool, greenish. I get no clove but lots of mothballs. It smells like a chilled flower shop with fresh flowers. Nothing sweet about this. I find it grown up and it fills an open spot for me. It’s gentle in projection and strength (I made an exception for the time being). 8/10-It is a truly lovely soliflore. It’s like when you smell lilacs or white lilies for the first time. Except in fresh flowers I don’t get mothballs.', 'Jasmine galore and I’m here for it.', ""I purchased this one in the bell jar option, as its such a beautiful one from Serge lutens and deserves the extra special bottle to be housed in my collection.  It opens with the cloves and green notes suddenly then it very quickly settles into the heart note of jasmine, along with a little honeyed benzoin detected within the base. As others have said - this is a fantastic jasmine soliflore. It absolutely radiates a feminine energy and it feels like standing in the moonlight whilst enhaling the flowers themselves. Despite it leaning feminine I am also sure that some men could pull this one off with confidence too. I would actually love to smell this on a man who could own it. This is a true to real life capturing of the Arabian jasmine plant, known as jasminum sambac for it's botanical name. There are different types of jasmine plants and they all have their own scent, with jasminum sambac being the most strong, heavy and indolic of them all. The juice in this one is probably heavier than you think and lasts longer than you realise, as with the smell of this flower it is quite easy to experience olfactory fatigue and go nose blind to it on yourself. So I'd caution against over applying an reapplying it too much. Although, if you're a lover of jasmine, I am sure you'd want to actually drown in this liquid. I grow the actual plant on a huge trellis at home that sits in front of my sunny South facing window. When it's in bloom my room is filled with the narcotic scent of jasmine sambac. The perfect white flowers, like bright white stars, all exhales their perfume like a goddess breathing into the atmosphere of this mortal world. This narcotic breath is bewitching and it comes most alive during those warm summer evenings. Having this experience in perfume form, whenever I wish to and when my plant is not in flower, is a real privilege and joy to me. I cherish this perfume and would recommend it to any other person who adores the jasmine plant too."", 'Cold, gothic, dry and a bit melancholic realistic jasmine blossoms under the moonlight.

Maybe a bit earthy I suppose. Anyway, now I know that I prefer a jasmine perfume with more layers.', ""I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this yet - I'm over half way through a well-loved bell jar of A La Nuit. As everyone says, this is the best jasmine soliflore of all time - that's not a compliment it's just a fact. A close relative from the same house, Sarrasins, is occasionally trotted out as a potential contender but it also has leather and touches of fruit (as well as much less indole)... A La Nuit is only jasmine and nothing else. The scent presents a hyper-realistic, note-perfect rendition of a jasmine plant in full bloom. It's hard to add more to it because any emotional associations one could have with the scent are simply the associations one has with jasmine. A La Nuit on my skin perhaps has the barest suggestions of morning dew from some green notes but this is less than 1% of the impression I get - it's just the flower overwhelmingly.  It's worth noting that jasmine is widely used in perfume but much of the time has its indole removed. Indole is a small molecule (the core part of tryptophan) which is naturally produced both by certain plants (like jasmines) and by the bacteria that live in the human gut. Smelled alone, it ranges from mothballs to fleshy, faecal touches but it is a natural part of the scent of jasmine and underlies its seductive heat. It is presented in full force here in A La Nuit but never strays into crass or unpleasant territory.  The linearity of A La Nuit can pose the risk of olfactory fatigue, however, which can lead to reapplication and risks becoming a jasmine nuke, so do dose carefully and ideally on your extremities so your nose doesn't get tired (speaking from personal experience). A La Nuit goes a clear 7 hours on my skin and is unisex because it smells like a plant."", ""This is hands down my favorite jasmine perfume. It's authentic and not at all cloying. If you've ever lived in New Orleans, it smells exactly like the Lower Garden District on a warm spring day: delicate, sweet, bright, humid, and just slightly vegetal. The only downside is that it's not a very long-lasting scent, at least not in my experience. Still, it's a great daytime perfume--unique, feminine, natural, and subtle. If you don't like white florals or indole, this perfume definitely isn't for you--but, on the flipside, if you like strong and sweet white florals, you might find this a little too natural. The perfect perfume for someone seeking an authentic jasmine scent. Maybe stick to sample sizes because of the lack of longevity, though!"", ""A beautiful jasmine solifor delicately combined with some green, musk, and benzoin notes.

Still, I can't stop myself from writing that this is the best jasmine soliflore I came across so far. Greek jasmine hedges on a hot afternoon in a bottle, indolic and beautiful. It's colder in my country of residence and people do not plant actual jasmine outside so I am more used to jasmine's tamer brother, mock orange (Philadelhus), but I still enjoy A La Nuit a lot.

To me it smells so intense, so true to the real flower, like you are standing in front of a full blossoming Jasmine bush, in a hot summer night in a mediterranean country. Hence the name... It reminds me of Morocco or Tunisia: it is luxurious, warm, very feminine. Must be used with a light hand as it can be very ""upfront"" and strong, possibly cloying or headache inducing to some noses... especially in summer. Not office friendly, neither similar public close gatherings (i.e. avoid on planes, cinemas or similar). To be worn with proper attire and with a poise, otherwise it will wear you!

Of course now it’s almost impossible to find. Sigh.  Today I was looking through my samples and low and behold, what do I see there? A la Nuit? I didn’t know I had that. I think it’s maybe 4 years old? Anyhow.  I sprayed it on my wrist, all excited to finally greet this beauty again... ??? Wait. Is this really à la Nuit? But, I already have an identical scent.

A La Nuit is for the fragrance lover who appreciates everything about a real jasmine flower, warts and all. It opens up with indoles galore (yes, it's slightly cacapoopooey) and will prevent anyone who hates white flowers from ever trying a jasmine fragrance again. But hear me out. A La Nuit later softens into a beautiful, sweet, creamy and narcotic jasmine. The scent hypnotizes you and forces you to keep sniffing.

This is almost euphoric it’s so sunshine fresh and uplifting like a perfect summer day. It’s like standing in front of a jasmine bush and inhaling the natural beautiful green from the flower to the leaves. This is demure and angelic. I read that this fragrance is a combination of all the different types of jasmine and the use of the jasmine flower from the bud all the way to it’s demise. It’s giving you the whole life of the jasmine flower from it’s budding first minutes to it’s animalic death. Such innocence here like a little fawn nuzzling the dewy soft jasmine petals on a forest floor. There is a gentle quality to SL fragrances that I’ve experienced that lull me into a quiet mood. My 5 year old smelled this on me rolled his eyes up and sighed. Then he said, “I want to go outside.” Yeah....so good it makes you dizzy and want a walk in nature. Anyway, this fragrance is definitely a jasmine lover’s dream. If you truly love jasmine but not too indolic and spicy like you find in Lust this is a nice option for you. I love both fragrances that celebrate the jasmine flower. This fragrance has a sort of flower on the vine quality that I’m very much digging. This jasmine is delicate, soft, heavy on the stem, and dripping with dew and very green like it’s alive. In fact I’m surprised that Dew isn’t among the notes listed. It just smells that way naturally. Must be those green notes that are sharp at first like the stem of the flower snapped in half right under your nose then it dies down and lingers just adding a tiny bit of freshness. The honey in this isn’t syrupy or thick like it is in Elie Saab or even that noticeable. It’s INCREDIBLY light. I feel like the description is missing the word “Fresh.” But not in an aquatic way, this smells like fresh cut narcotic jasmine. There is also an animalic twinge there. This jasmine seems to go though all the stages from fresh all the way to it’s demise. Now that I have a more developed notes I recognize just how animalic this fragrance is it’s got a musky quality of jasmine that the green note and the menthol like clove slices through with a vaporous knife. All the other notes in this fragrance just support that beautiful jasmine note so smoothly and brilliantly and are basically creating a jasmine soliflore. All this creates a photorealistic fresh realistic jasmine. So far I’m very impressed with Serge Lutens. I can’t wait to add more from this house to my collection. Monsieur Lutens is a poet with scent. Like any great artist he takes me to a visceral place. But his art is a place of beauty, positivity, nostalgia, a zen like meditation. I’m gives me a rush of dopamine. I know I sound a bit overboard but I feel this fragrance. It has a soul.', ""Oh.My.God! This is the most authentic jasmine scent I've ever encountered, hands down! The opening is so divine, it's like being surrounded by thousands of jasmines on full bloom with a hint of something sweet (honey?) then die down into very soft, airy and lingering ones. I used to love picking jasmines and pressing them between the pages of a book as a child and this just brings back those good old days... a must-try for those who enjoy jasmine."", 'This is the best jasmine ever.

This is one of those situations where the subjective nature of people's loves, likes, and dislikes astounds me, not to mention the role of body chemistry.

Possibly because Sheldrake combined a multitude of jasmine notes, this jasmine goes through several subtle transitions . . . from tropical to fragile to hothouse. The secondary notes hover in the background, never coalescing into an intrusion, simply adding context for the white stars.

It is a cool, autumn day today, with temperatures in the 50s, and the longevity is moderate and the sillage is soft.

Something so natural, primal and positive. But not primal in an animalic way, nor positive in a candy way. They have brightness and beauty that can really be unisex (although in my opinion, very sensual and feminine), there is not too much of anything.  If I had to describe them in one word, I would say sincere. And I appreciate this among everything. I really feel like myself wearing them. Plus, they are long lasting and have perfect lively performance. I actually prefer Fleurs d\'Oranger. A La Nuit is more serious and reserved, for my taste is more ""normal"" and unisex.

It has some rancid in the jasmines as I believe the jasmines used here are Indian jasmine which is famous of being quite strong and has big amount of rancidity.

Almost as a revolt, I find myself returning to my good old CK one, which doesn't even come close to what I wish I would smell like. But I am just fed up with Jasmine fragrances either being super indolic or smell like a random white floral green citrussy mix. A la Nuit is a good Jasmine and in a way it satisfies my Jasmine cravings, but it just has some sort of 'bitter' note to it that i find in many soliflore Jasmines and that I am not too fond of.

The reason is that jasmine is so easily 'too much': too narcotic, indolic, animalic, and if used judiciously, can be too easily overwhelmed by other notes.

If you don't like this sensation in life, you probably won't in a fragrance, either. It soon becomes more spacious, softening with soapy tufts of white, honeyed cream.

Serge Lutens compares its fragrance to a ladder with rungs of silk, in which the perfume exudes until it reaches heaven to explode like fireworks. A La Nuit has notes of white honey (considered one of the most valuable in the market, because of its sweet content, its purity, and its color), benzoin, cloves, musk, green shoots and three types of Jasmine: Moroccan, Egyptian and Indian (also known as star Jasmine). Obviously, this is a perfume dominated by jasmine. For this reason, is one of the few perfumes of the House that is classified as feminine. If you don\'t like fragrances with jasmine very present, so don\'t even think about meeting A La Nuit. However, even if it is the case, I\'m sure you will admire the quality of this creation. A La Nuit touches the skin showing all possible facets of jasmine. In the first phase of evolution, it is possible to feel the indolic jasmine, the sensual and the fruity, as well as the dirty jasmine, the carnal and the green. It\'s like diving into an absolute of jasmine that exhales with perfection. Then, about 2 hours after application, the floral aspect becomes calmer and you can notice nuances that are greener and vegetable, so to speak. I believe it is the smell of green shoots. At the same time, a slight sweetness lards the base of the fragrance and the musk also becomes more vivid. At this stage, I find myself intrigued by the distinctive aroma and I wonder if I would have the courage to buy a bottle for my own use. So, the reason speaks louder than the emotion and I remember that A La Nuit is not a perfume made for men, according to Serge\'s option. It worths saying that in addition to project very well, it also remained for more than 10 hours on my skin. I can see several women wearing this perfume: the single, the engaged, the innocent, the naughty, the naive, the smart, the simple or the elegant. As well as all the nuances of jasmine were bottled in a fragrance, with A La Nuit all women can be one.', 'This is Godly beautiful! So beautiful it hurts!

The very first few moments of the perfume are slightly cacophonous - the orchestra warming up. What you smell is an intensely natural interpretation of jasmine, of smelling jasmine in real life, the whole plant. There's the heady scent of the blossoms themselves, of course, and also their leaves, and maybe other leaves in the garden. There's the mildest hint of the minerally dirt they grow in. There are gusts of wind in this garden, all is not calm. Very soon, the orchestra finds its note, and comes together: now we have the blossom proper, and how beautiful it is. Intoxicatingly rich, but somehow delicate as well. At around the half-hour mark the orchestra adds (to my nose) a base note of perhaps ylang-ylang, or another yellow flower; this transforms the jasmine briefly into an almost-tropical gardenia accord. This stage is round and beautiful, but rather short-lived; the orchestra soon finds its original note again. And this is the note it holds, unwavering, for HOURS. Now, it's a beautiful note, but imagine the terrible beauty of an orchestra holding one note. What started off as gorgeous and tranquil becomes, only by repetition, madness-inducing.  I get basically no development from A la Nuit, no warmth or melding with the skin. Just this persistent, too-real jasmine always hovering about me.

There are no daffodils in the blend, but on me that's all there is until the dry down. Sadly it comes too soon. My early Spring time morning is gone in about half an hour. Sillage is moderate.

Jasmine, though I know it comes in many forms and from many regions, ""feels Indian"" to me. A La Nuit is complex and deep, yet pure and understandable at the same time - like the love of Radha-Krishna. While creamy jasmine is the dominant note in this composition, a subtle greenness reaches around the heart of A La Nuit with perfect timing, before everything feels too thick. A La Nuit gets a little ""barnyard"" on my skin, but I like pulling the anamalic notes here! Radha was a gopi (a cow-herding girl) and the anamalic notes further fuel the scene in my head of gopis amongst gentle cows and the divine love of Radha-Krishna. This fragrance lacks projection after about an hour which would normally make me irritated, but with A La Nuit it seems fitting - like someone else is meant to get close to you to experience it. I\'ll reach for this on amourous nights when I am open to imagining, experiencing and immersing myself in love, love, love.', 'Absolutely agree with a previous review that A LA Nuit, SL is reminiscent of Beige, Chanel- the same sweet, fresh, spicy, honey, white floral vibes.

The jasmine is full but polite, it is not skanky or indolic, it just reminds me of fresh blooms saturated with scent, in a squeaky clean universe where flowers would never dare smell earthy or dirty like the soil they sprang from.  My big problem with A la Nuit, and I don't know why I'm the only one mentioning this, is the staying power. Sure, in the first hour things are beautiful, but this perfume really starts to sputter out on me rather fast, and by two hours in I am down to a skin scent. Four hours in I am left with but a faint musk drydown that I have to bury my nose against to detect. So that kind of ruins it for me.  My review ends here, but I must digress a little.

I assumed it was either jasmine or other white florals of some kind - I just wanted to see what made this different from other white florals. If it truly was 'dirty' or 'fecal'... Right off the bat, it's a very powerful scent. A sweet and smoky burst of jasmine, accompanied by pleasant green notes. I'm still not sure I understand indoles, but what I do get out of A La Nuit is a very believable, deep floral experience. It's like sniffing actual jasmine in a dewy, grassy field. But those green, grassy notes quickly dissipate and it develops into something much sultrier. Whew, there's that smoke again! I can tell it's the cloves causing the back of my throat to tingle, because it's exactly the same sensation as being around second-hand smoke from clove cigarettes. (Which luckily reminds me of my late teens, hanging around in clovey smoke-filled concert venues). That smoky quality also dies down a little bit, and leaves just a lingering trail of smoke and spice, like an incense stick burning out. Ahh... If this indeed features indoles, fear not - this isn't fecal at all. Is it 'dirty'? Well, maybe in the way that soil can have a rich, pleasing earthy scent. Also worth noting - various types of African/Indian jasmine were used in this composition, and it shows. It's absolutely exotic and fascinating."", 'Yes indeed, there is some jasmine here, and yet...... Very linear for me. I am fond of the white flowers so this is an easy scent to like. I am really enjoying my sample and a little goes a long way, so it will last a long time Having said that, I feel that something is missing to make this frag complete. Would I purchase a FB, no. Edit November I think I might get a better reading of this frag if I apply a spray from a bottle rather than dabbing from a sample.  This is the first jasmine in my quest for the perfect jasmine scent. Edit, 2016. Still the best jasmine that I have found, so far.', ""Wow this fragrance is so addictive, i don't know what to say. The jasmine is a real live blooming bush in the garden just after sunset and the aroma is intoxicating. Its has a slightly sweet edge coz of the honey and the cloves stops it going over board. There is also a tenderness and mystery about it It's just poetic i don't know how to describe it...but i think i have found my signature scent.!!! Actually this is how i would describe this fragrance...... Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;"", ""On the hunt for my perfect jasmine, I sampled A La Nuit. It smells very much like Montale's Jasmin Full. Both perfumes really pay homage to the jasmine flower. However, I will add that both perfumes contain a slightly bitter, stale soap scent about them that is unpleasant. Where this quality starts out strong in Montale's perfume yet ultimately disappears entirely, it is not so strong in A La Nuit, but it never quite goes away. For this reason, I prefer Jasmin Full. Edited to add: I own La Religieuse, and while I do not like the top notes, the drydown is really beautiful. The jasmine in the drydown is sweeter and more tender than in A La Nuit. A La Nuit is jasmine in full bloom. La Religieuse is the delicate little buds."", 'I was at a Shiseido counter and the sales assistant relentlessly kept trying to sell me a red lipstick, I am not a red lipstick person! She gave up, and showed me Serge Lutens A La Nuit and said ""this is red lipstick in a perfume"". She gave me several samples of this to try. This is not just red lipstick in a bottle but pure Lust! Stark and overbearing jasmine that is animalistic and sweet. You check into Jasmines brothel and never check out! There is honey in this but thank goodness its just enough and balanced with a bit of green and freshness. A small memory from jasmine and I: There was a hipster scene bar in the middle of the city where I used to live, the kind of bar where people smoke strange things, drinking micro brew beer, art work everywhere, bands playing... it was really ""cool"" but how I found this place is because the whole wall/fence that was hiding this bar was completely covered in jasmine and left a huge trail of it\'s scent in the area. A friend and I were walking to another bar and next thing we know ""Wow, what is that smell?! Where is that coming from?!"" we instead followed the jasmine scent to find this scene bar. It was fun to have some Wiccan girl describe me her soul, the universe, and a hot guy in tattoos and piercings flirting with me. True story! The bar has been renamed many times but always kept that jasmine covered wall. A La Nuit reminds me of that time and smells like realistic fresh jasmine, leaving a solid trail of flowers for you to trip and fall headfirst into its pungent heart.  This has got to be my favorite jasmine perfume. Unforgettable. A must have for jasmine lovers!', 'Sweet sweet sweet jasmine. Incidentally my favourite note, so I\'m a clear fan of this, but it lacks what could have been done with and to jasmine by lutens....it could have been dirtied, made greener, it could have been lifted into brightness or deepened into sexy nuances...in "" a la nuit"" it sits pretty and sweet, with medium sillage and staying power, but doesn\'t quite develop into anything as misterious as the fragrance name implies.', 'Fantastic…. A burst of clear jasmine ringing like a bell, after a few minutes settling into one of the best jasmine scents in existence, very green, very fresh. Mine lasted 4 hours at least and I can still smell faint honey. It is delicious. I don’t see why women shouldn’t smell of a perfect flower if they want to; certainly it cheered me up and other people loved it too. The Perfume Guide is just a Guide - I would take this over Angel or Calyx, any day. Sorry, Luca. I love it. :)', ""Bottled romance. A la Nuit is sensual, feminine, poetic and intoxicating, and reminds me of something that I'd wear on a balmy summer's evening or to a ballet concert. This scent dances on my skin, with the jasmine floral slowly fading into a creamy honey before it disappears. I am in love!"", ""When I looked to my left I noticed a jasmine shrub into the night. Jasmine. Beautiful, fresh jasmine was in bloom and wafted over my eyes. I didn't have to open them to see the stars. Moving slowly the warm breeze fell over me like midnight meringue.  In the morning I shivered and pulled the sheet tighter over my body. I went to close the balcony door when I saw the jasmine flowers were bowing their heads. They left their guard and I took up mine."", 'A Narcotic, Night Blooming Jasmine... Serge Lutens A la Nuit is a truly beautiful and authentic smelling jasmine composition. It contains three different types of Jasmine (Moroccan, Indian & Egyptian), as well as honey and green notes. It evokes very well the natural smell of Jasmine at night. If you\'ve ever been in a hot or warm climate, like the mediterranean or middle east or in asia, and smelled Jasmine growing in long green vines along a wall or in a garden, this is it. A la Nuit is a Jasmine lovers dream.  For me this Jasmine is a beautifully composed, wonderfully authentic smell of natural Jasmine flowers, with a soothing and calming effect. It can be a little too much if you do not like Jasmine as much as I do, but I think this Jasmine is tame enough to appeal to most people. It has a ""green"" quality and is surrounded by notes which slightly soften the intensity of the heavy, indolic Jasmine. The green leaves, honey & musk give the impression that you are in a tropical forest, drenched in a soft glow of moonlight, with a cool wind cutting through the tropical, humid air. I find it green, refreshing, and most of all... wearable. If you want a full, authentic Jasmine experience, this is a good place to start.', ""There is something so beautiful and pure about jasmine. My mom has always worn jasmine which is why I think I have such a fondness for it. Upon first spray it's quite heavy and a bit headache inducing for the first 10 minutes or so. The dry down is soft and close to the skin. This smells kind of similar to the perfume by Jennifer Aniston. I hate to say, but, it smells a little too mature for my taste. I also can't justify spending so much on a fragrance that simply doesn't last (Literally a half hour then POOF! it's gone!). Pretty, but, I'll pass."", 'exactly the way i remember jasmine,and how incredible SL can catch the entire scent from the flower not only i smell blossoms but with petals, leaves and even stems. So fresh!', ""This review is based on a decant. I don't have a trained nose but on my skin I get mainly beautiful jasmine with a green undertone. With that said, I'm actually a little disappointed as I was expecting indolic jasmine. I get moderate projection and good longevity on my skin."", ""What a beautiful jasmine scent! This jasmine feels like cashmere. It is so smooth and warm and cozy. Probably one of the nicest jasmine scents I've ever tried. Very well done!"", ""A La Nuit is exactly what I suspected it might be: a beautiful jasmine soliflore--graceful and clean. Luminous with fragrant jasmine petals and barely a touch of natural indole, just as you might find on a jasmine bush prolific with newly opened blossoms. However full-featured the flower's fragrance is, it does not present much in the way of a deep sensual aura on my skin a' la Nuda by Nasomatto. Somehow I find that although beautifully accented with complementary notes, it tempers the true essence of the jasmine flower. With or without carnal intentions, A La Nuit remains a well rounded quality jasmine perfume blended delicately with greens, honey and cloves. A La Nuit is more wearable than most jasmine fragrances as the supporting notes cleanly cut through the typical headiness while still being potently floral. Where Christopher Sheldrake masterfully harnesses the beauty of jasmine, she is still captive in her ivory tower. Personally, I prefer Alessandro Gualtieri's interpretation. In Nuda, he is obviously very intimate with this blossom and lets her run beautifully wild with her aphrodisiacal power. Where A La Nuit is jasmine, Nuda is jasmine intense."", ""I feel I have to counterpoint the previous review and its emphasis on a cumin note. We all smell differently, so here's my experience. I wish I could detect any cumin in this fragrance, or any hint of animalics for that matter, but instead, to my nose it's nothing more and nothing less than a glorious photo-realistic jasmine with a slightly sweet base. I personally try to sneak cumin in in all my blends, and adore the perfumes where it's used generously, as in Vero Kern's Rubj edp, but I understand some people associate it with lack of hygiene rather than raunchy encounters. However, please don't be put off from sampling this beauty as I believe cumin is non-existent here."", 'So this is what night-blooming Jasmine is! A la Nuit has been a great education in perfumery for me :-D I had long ago written off the entire Lutens line, based upon a generous free sampling of ~ 30 SL perfumed wax domes, provided directly by the House itself- Nearly all of the 30 frags. sampled seemed heavily laden w/ Cumin, Pot, Cigarettes / Beer-spilled Ashtray, Cigar Tobacco, Leather Jackets, Stale Bong Water, Patchouli, Smoke, anything & everything that smells either very masculine, &/or like the 80\'s head shops we frequented as teens, + endless all night partying... Someone always ended up spilling the bong water (usually me :) - An odour one never forgets.  However, A la Nuit was not among the above samples. Based on glowing reviews, & seeing A la Nuit on sale @ FragranceNet, I blind-bought a bottle. The reviews are all true- The Jasmine is pure & intense. One caveat: The blend contains just the itsy-bitsy-est amount of stanky, cursed Cumin! Or, is it possible that this is what\'s meant by ""indolic""? Rank Stank. Is that the ""animalic"" component? I HATE that note. It\'s quiet (and brief) enough, and the Jasmine is so sublimely supreme, that most won\'t be bothered by it- In fact, no other reviews detect it at all :) I guess I\'m hypersensitive to even the slightest inclusion of cumin (or indoles?). Monster sillage & longevivity. Thankfully, SL packages this w/ both an atomizer & a splash/dab-on (screw on) cap- Owner\'s choice. Beware risk of over-application. POTENT! I\'ve learned to dab very sparingly (vs. spray, which dispenses much too much)... Too much of this immensely intense \'fume left me suffocating in my own wake. PS: ""Sarassins"" is SL\'s ""other Jasmine"" less indolic, airier, softened, blended Jasmine- Yet still a powerhouse in itself. Ammended- I gifted my bottle to a friend. Though I dig Jasmine blended in small amounts in so many other \'fumes, this intense Jasmine was just too indolic/overwhelming for me, even 8-10 hours after application. Furthermore, it smelled just like Jasmine CPO (ie, Al Rehab ""Full""). Hopefully its being better-loved by its new owner', 'This is my first Serge to sample and I fell instantly in love with it! Gorgeous blend of jasmine and honey. It is so soft, creamy, and airy. If money were no object, I would hit the buy button today!', ""If Lush Lust is the loud, dark, sweet, naughty, carnal, fleshy, creamy, indolic jasmine, A La Nuit is the exact opposite of it; a calm, bright, sweet, nice, gentle, airy, creamy, radiant, soft, real blooming jasmine. I gave mine away because I like my jasmine scents more dirty, but it's definitely a very good scent, maybe even a blind buy if you are sure you want a true, non-indolic, very realistic jasmine scent and nothing more."", ""Jasmine garland in a bottle. Pure, natural and exotic. A La Nuit and Olene by Diptyque are my fav realistic jasmine fragrances. They're really similar to my nose. Olene has more complexity on greenish and floral while A La Nuit sweeter and heavier but also more concentrate jasmine solifore. It does smelled like lively, alive dewy jasmine but can be cloying(and too indolic) if you're putting it too much. Aside from jasmine, green bud and honey I cannot detect any other notes at all. Projection quite heavy but not last long. Only 3-4hours on me and completely disappear. Recommend to all jasmine lover. You'll be surprise by how real jasmine is in A La Nuit."", ""A very clear and sparkling jasmine that is uplifting and true to the essential oil. In fact it reminds me of this Egyptian Jasmine I brought back from Cairo for my girlfriend many years ago. There is also a hint of green making the jasmine smell fresh like it's just been plucked from a bush. Great if you love your jasmine straight up without other notes. But may be lacking if you expect more complexity from your fragrance. Great jasmine though!"", ""I'm enjoying something of a jasmine-fest this evening - wearing A la Nuit and in another room burning a beautiful Indian jasmine incense. (Thanks to @Galya for generous decant!) Reading the reviews and comparisons between A La Nuit and Sarassins it's obvious that one of the dividers is indolic jasmine - i.e fecal notes. I have absolutely no issue with fecal notes in A La Nuit because they seem to be there, naturally, but haven't been ramped up deliberately, which usually annoys me because it stands out as fake (I've used pure absolute of jasmine as bath oil and A La Nuit feels very authentic) I can see why people would prefer Sarassins to A La Nuit in as much as Sarassins is more complex. But this evening I'm just enjoying jasmine. A La Nuit reminds me a little of my very first perfume, when I was about 13, which was the Body Shop's Jasmine. It's simple in that sense, but A La Nuit has much more depth. And yes, you could buy a very high quality jasmine absolute, but that would set you back about as much as the perfume! What Lutens seems to have done is add a fruity note which (reminds me of pear-drops at first, a bit like acetone) which combined with Jasmine's natural banana/green quality makes this really project an aroma (as Jasmine flowers do in real life). The fruit and clove notes also cut through and lift jasmine's viscous heavy quality (it's viscous and heavy in absolute). The dry down seems to suddenly drop off after two hours into a mild benzoin/jasmine skin scent, though it lingers longer on clothes Indole notes have been compared to a horse-sweat smell,and I spent many a day in my youth brushing down sweaty horses and ponies while working in horse stables - maybe that's where my tolerance for sweaty perfume notes stems from! The upshot is, I love jasmine, and will happily wear this on sunnier days, or perhaps layered with other perfumes. Sillage (on my skin anyway) - powerful for 15 minutes then calms and fades to skin scnt after 1 hour. Longevity - around three hours but lingers longer on clothes"", ""A beautiful jasmine fragrance, remindes me of the now discontinued Nassamota Nuda. If you love your heady jasmine you'll love it."", 'The scent of Jasmine is alluring enough as it is, but the flower gardens in my native Cyprus just OOZE of Jasmine after dark. The baking hot sunshine that radiates on the flowers during the day causes the aroma to be released ten fold at night, in my opinion. This is my first Serge and Lutens fragrance and is quite an amazing one. You don\'t need a lot, as the scent is quite concentrated as it is. Just a spritz and you can expect it to last all day. This scent amazes me by how ""close"" to the real thing it really is. I feel like I have my face buried in a flower bed of jasmine plants when this is down to the heart notes.', ""I'm not the biggest jasmine fan in the world, but I wanted to love it. So I got a sample of this from my friend that runs an indie fragrance boutique in my city. It smelled amazing on the tester strips, and I was dearly hoping that it'd smell just as amazing on my skin..my skin loves to KILL jasmine, making me smell like mothballs and litter boxes.  This was way worse...my skin just cannot pull off jasmine, aside from Thierry Mugler's Alien or my Jasmine oil. A La Nuit smelled almost exactly like coppertone sunscreen...and it lasted several hours, so this wasn't a great experience at all. With a sigh, I guess it's time to throw in the towel in terms of finding a new jasmine fragrance."", ""The most realistic jasmine I've smelled in a perfume. A bit green at first, but then it's just jasmine, and it's perfect.  It is a real pity it's got such week lasting power, especially considering the price."", ""Such a joyous scent! The jasmine is almost aggressive in its intensity and yet it remains both luminous and sunny. For me A la Nuit is a perfume for winter mornings when the sun doesn't seem to rise at all. I surround myself with the summer it conjures up before stepping out of the front door in the morning, and I actually smile through the slate and the blizzards in wintry Finland. When the first cloud of jasmine petals has retreated the sillage becomes moderate and if applied with some restriction I find that A la Nuit is actually an excellent scent for the office. And how it glitters and glimmers in the dark of winter!"", 'Dark, delicate jasmine and moody musk. Very pretty, and a bit enigmatic; a fragile floral with a projective punch (apologies for all the alliteration, can’t help myself). Assuredly feminine, though not what I would call sexy, rather, seductive in a reserved (work/every day appropriate) adore me from afar kind of way. There is, however, a playful undercurrent to it that keeps it fresh, alive, and anything but flat-out funereal…the dreaded fate of many a darkish floral. I’ve read that some people have problems with the longevity on this one but I have to say that I sprayed it on in the morning (2 quick spritzes) and it was still floating happily about me when getting back into bed that night. Gotta admire its tenacity.', ""THIS....is a jasmine bomb. If you like jasmine you will probably flip over backwards and hurt yourself when you smell this. I am not a jasmine fan but I appreciate quality and this is a high quality jasmine fragrance. It is very realistic and you get a full on dose of it. The other notes take a total and complete backseat to this. This is all about the jasmine and nothing but the jasmine. It isn't my thing but it is very well done."", ""the best jasmin i've ever tried!"", 'Best jasmine scent ever. A bit too strong, almost medicinal, in the opening, then it turns wonderful.', 'A muddled, almost ""grimy"" opening on my skin turns to a pleasant if very short-lived jasmine soliflore. Won\'t be a repeat buy for me.', 'This is a must try for Jasmine lovers. I agree with Vie Cafe that it is almost an exact replica of the essential oil I have. It opens as a true jasmine bomb - so much so that you might wonder if you applied a bit too much. But after it swirls around and teases you a bit with its exuberance, it settles into its sensual nature. The greens play hide and seek with the honey and that chocolatey essence that benzoin imparts (at least to my nose),and the whole experience is quite delightful and a bit spritely! I must tell you. Early this evening I took a bath, moisturized my skin with jojoba oil and applied Al la Nuit. I went to the market and encountered two men who remarked on how ""pretty"" I was. I tell you, it was A la Nuit - that, and perhaps the Spring twilight! Magical combination. Do try if you appreciate jasmine.', ""I agree with the comment that this is a gourmand white floral fragrance. Dewy and a bit green - naturally sweet jasmine made richer by a distinct honey note. It develops quite beautifully, with a musky/powdery dry down on my skin. Don't notice much clove (phew) or benzoin. This is quite lovely! Hubby likes it too!"", ""From the wax sample I smell clear jasmine all the way, maybe because the sample doesn't last. It is kinda like jasmine tea. I've been looking for this kind of fragrance since I miss the Jasmine sambac from the backyard scent. Very enjoyable and beautiful."", 'I swear I smell lilac in the opening phrases of this. Beautiful lilac, though. Very true to life.', ""I spritzed à la nuit when I was at Ogilvie's in Montreal. After 10 minutes, it had settled into a powerful yet soft jasmine smell. A little bit of green, a little bit of sweetness. A lot of happiness. A perfect spring and summer scent. I was enthralled.  So I bought it online and today, I decided to try it again. Same sharp and pungent opening of concentrated jasmine juice. Same drydown into a softer, almost soliflore, jasmine cloud, with a hint of green. But... I also smell something else... Like a faint suggestion of sweet rotting meat. Not sure I like this part.  As an aside, à la nuit reminds me of the original Lumière de Rochas that my sister used to wear back in the early '90s. From memory, Lumière is more translucent with a touch of an oriental base. If not sister, they are first degree cousins."", ""For some reason I can't add that this stuff smells super similar to another jasmine perfume I own, Demeter Fragrance Jasmine. At first spray I get a punch of jasmine, which I like. Cool, calming jasmine flowers, and I can't really smell anything else - whatever else is in this is understated next to the power of the jasmine. Was looking for a bit more depth than this, but I will wear Demeter Jasmine and this fragrance side by side on another trial and see which lasts longer."", 'You can really smell the blend of the sweet accords of green branches and honey.', ""Wearing Serge Lutens A La Nuit is part of my search for a jasmine perfume that will enchant my husband, a jasmine fan, while allowing me to enjoy it as well.  When I first dabbed it on it was so very pretty. I felt transported to a rain-dampened garden redolent of tuberose, gardenia and jasmine. Very lovely, light-spirited and sexy. My husband loved it, and it didn't overwhelm me with some of the white flower notes at the top. It made me feel sophisticated, feminine and soft. Sadly for me, it dried down to almost nothing within two hours, and for me the sillage was negligible. Definitely a perfume to enjoy up close, and when it doesn't need to last long. Next time I try it, it will be right before I slip on some silky lingerie and slide into bed next to my handsome man.  Enjoy it, though. It's an ephemeral beauty!"", 'This is one of my new all time favorites! I bought a small sample and fell in love with the fresh and slightly sweet jasmine fragrance that smells almost exactly like the jasmine bushes around my house. Oddly, when I purchased the full bottle it was a slightly more green scent at first, but still wonderful and FULL of jasmine in the dry down. The honey undertone is not sugary, but just enough to conjure the fragrance of pollen. This is such a true to life scent that whenever I wear this I am immediately transported to a spring night, walking down a street lined with jasmine flowers. I cannot say enough good things about this, it is truly beautiful :)', 'If Athenais de Montespan wore perfume (well, she most certainly did - that is to say, if she were alive to wear it in THIS century), it would be A La Nuit. This is a lush, *sweet*, slightly indolic jasmine blend. It is STRONG and will take your breath away. I am one of the strongest consummate jasmine lovers of all time, so this was immediately a hit with me. Others may not like the slight indoles of the topnote or the fact that, yes, the drydown is far more gentle and subdued than you would imagine. But the drydown is lovely in that it disguises itself as your natural scent - it comes out of the pores, almost. This fragrance is beautiful both in winter and summer, to evoke dreams of Baroque lushness in the cold and to bloom in humid heat.', ""I feel rather more jasmine in Fleurs d'Oranger rather than in this fragrance. So I prefer it to A La Nuit.

It\'s so beautiful. It smells like a bush of jasmine on a cool summer night. It\'s soft, lovely, and warm on my skin. I feel luxurious when I wear it.

The sandalwood and the jasmine blend so beautifully!', 'And the projection?? It s really that little??', 'I was expecting jasmine, but all I experienced was a punch of tuberose, which I detest. Strange.', 'Pure beautiful seductive jasmine, dries down with a honey and slightly spicy note. Just beautiful. Very delicate and lovely fragrance. Not your typical in your face Lutens at all. I love the softness of this one.', 'Jasmine is a beautiful, seductive, and mysterious flower--let\'s face it. Jasmine serves as the floral centerpiece of many a perfume because it also blends so well with just about everything else--even purple goo, as in the case of Thierry Mugler ALIEN. In this case, Serge Lutens A LA NUIT is a jasmine soliflore with a bit of a twist, whose name is ""clove"". The opening of A LA NUIT evoked immediate memories of a recent wearing of Molinard JASMIN, which I do believe may be my favorite soliflore--of any flower, not just jasmine--of all time. Both are strong, creamy, slightly dark--night-blooming!--and breathtakingly beautiful. Both smell very natural to my nose, and I suspect that both compositions do showcase the real thing, not hedione or some other synthetic substitute. The difference between the Molinard and Le Grand Serge jasmine soliflore becomes more and more obvious as A LA NUIT dries down. A clove note not initially obvious to my nose begins to make its presence known until the point where I feel that clove has almost taken over the star role of this perfume. However, I am *very* sensitive to clove, so I\'d encourage all jasmine lovers to try this perfume on for size, as it may well be your jasmine dream come true. Mine remains the Molinard soliflore.', ""Unadulterated indolic jasmine. With a drop of honey in it it makes me think of that one drop you add to warm milk before bed, which doesn't really change it only makes it better and in this case enhances the authenticity of the flower. Quite an animalic one though, I would reserve this for evenings. One of the best jasmine scents I've tried."", 'What a lovely jasmine scent:) beyond fresh, pure, clean, soft, feminine..... Jasmine and grenadine are a perfect match.  All I want to say is thumbs up and Yummzza for this one!', ""I looove the duo Lutens-Sheldrake, they create such incredible gems! And jasmine is one of my top favorite notes. So i was expecting to fall head over heel for À la nuit... not quite though. I tried it numerous times, at every new test telling myself I just had to ease into this intoxicating jasmine (my favorite kind!!!).  The start is great with its squeaky, neon green jasmine that yells HERE I AM!!! I like the lily of the valley that appears next (vaguely similar to diorissimo for a minute), combined with the oily, dense jasmine scent, it is quite interesting. Jasmine, when used in such a heady way, often has a faint exhaust fumes smell that gives a nice edge to the overall scent. So far, so good.  But after about 30 minutes, the magic is gone. A dissonant overripe banana note appears, and it just won't go away... It is by no means overwhelming, and i hoped i would just be able to ignore it, but no such luck. Sadly, that ruins it for me."", ""It's smells like a toilet aromatic...  white flower with a bloody smell I was shocked when I test it."", ""So far my favourite Serge Lutens fragrance! I sometimes find SG's scents to be perfect on paper but all wrong when you actually smell it, on my skin they tend to be overpowering and to musky. Much to my suprise this was not the case with A La Nuit. I orderd the sample out of curiosity to see how Lutens does a feminine floral compared to his more woody/musky/tobacco/leather fragrances and i have to say i was pleasantly suprised. What i smell is sweet grenadine with a really good jasmine and honey, it is nice to smell a really good jasmine as i often find a bad one can be too sharp and cloying. To me the good jasmine makes this fragrance, it is softened by the honey which is not overly sweet and the grenadine adds a somewhat fruity dimension on my skin. To me it smells somewhat like Jean Patou Joy which my Grandmother used to wear but it is in no way a perfume for the older generation, the grenadine see's to that! It also reminds me of L'artisan Parfumeur's La Haie Flueurie but with a much better jasmine and sweeter!"", 'A nice and fresh oriental, full of Jasmine. Maybe the most feminine Lutens creation, along with Sa Majeste la Rose. The others can be worn by us, men. It does not scream ""Lutens"" as the others: Tubereuse Criminelle, Arabie, Fumerie Turque, Chergui, but it manages to be borderline avantgarde. It works even for teen girls.', ""I am very glad to see honey listed as a note here, because for hours after smelling A La Nuit I was wondering why it reminded me of another Serge Lutens creation, Miel de Bois. Turns out it was the honey accord which made them slightly familiar to my nose. Despite the honey note, A La Nuit is mostly jasmine. It's a pleasant, somewhat soapy and cuddly type of jasmine, that when applied to the skin, almost becomes a skin scent. A La Nuit is less fresh than I thought it would be. It settles rather warmly on my skin. The honey and benzoin create a somewhat balanced and smooth blend which in turn prompts a feeling of feminine sensuality. I realised while smelling A La Nuit that this is a jasmine scent devoid of indoles, that chemical component that makes some jasmine based fragrances smell like cat pee or fecal matter. I can see how this has become a well-loved fragrance since its release. It's simple yet beautiful. A clean and intimate jasmine blend, perfectly inoffensive. I like A La Nuit, but I much prefer the louder and darker Sarrasins. However that is due to my rather odd tastes. All in all it is a perfect example of a jasmine fragrance composed with a lot of thought and expertise."", 'this jasmine is very alcoholic!!like some kind of sweet candy with alcoholic syrup (granatine?). also balmy deep and intense it remember me nasomatto feminine scents(narcotic venus); i like it. pleasant more then some other jasmine update:here is a slightly fecal note..I think is musk plus honey very fecal--bee-animalic indole Lutens style but very simple this time', ""Best to test first, I agree with airubgirl and a lot more, I read in her review, makes perfect sense . Especially about the love and hate factor. Of course I'm an admirer of Serge Lutens, but this one made me hysterically scrub and scrub, nothing wrong with sillage nor longevity. The scent itself though, in combination with my skin and my olfactory taste, makes me choke with abhorrence.

Initially there are some greenish, moist notes that give the impression of a real flower, but as these fade away it becomes slightly spicy.  A clove note is present in many night-fragrant flowers, so it’s completely in keeping with the general theme. It’s strong, it’s assertive. At first it has major sillage even from a tiny dab, but within 3-4 hours it’s gone. For a floral, I like this, but not enough to wear often.', ""As with all Lutens it's either a love or hate relationship it seems. For whatever reason his fragrances evoke a very intense yes or no in the wearer. I have sampled many of this line, own quite a few, and while I can appreciate them for the art that they are, most I would never wear. A la nuit is one I do quite like and I do wear. For whatever reason on me it is a very soft, almost soapy jasmine and I mean that in a good way, a very, very expensive soap that leaves just enough of the scent to linger and float on the breeze without overpowering those in it's wake. There is nothing cloying or overpowering with my chemistry. Just softly sexy, with enough sweetness to really ramp up the mmmm factor! On first spray I get a burst of jasmine, think summer monsoon, a bit humid, and a breeze floats over the jasmine and it's scent drifts in the wind. The heart notes are soft and sweet with the honey coming into play, to it's final stage the green, crisp, fresh jasmine that stays true to the flower. Nothing chemical here on me. Very clean and linear in this stage, but very nice indeed. Lasts for hours and stays true.. While I can't say I love this frag, I can say it's very wearable and quite pretty. I would recommend trying a sample first, as with all this line."", ""I had hight expetations for this one, but it's far too strong and cloy I could not wear this. If you want a beautiful jasmine get Olene by Dyptique, is one of my favorites for summer."", '...Вымаливала молний ночь, Чтобы самой себе помочь И руки к небу возводя Дождя - шептала ночь - дождя. Был от жасмина пьян жасмин Всю ночь творилось что-то с ним И он подглядывал в окно Где было шорохно, грешно, Где чуть мерцая простыня Сползла с тебя, сползла с меня И от слиянья наших тел Жасмин зажмурился, вспотел. Друг друга мы любили так Что ты иссякла, я иссяк Лишь по телам во все концы Блуждали пальцы, как слепцы. С твоей груди моя рука Сняла ночного мотылька, Я целовал еще, еще Чуть-чуть соленое плечо Ты встала, подошла к окну Жасмин отпрянул в темноту Сползали волосы на грудь И прикрывали как-нибудь...  Евгений Евтушенко', ""Lush jasmine that gets thin as it dries down, then develops that unfortunate mothball-indole note. It's okay, but this has been done a whole lot better in other perfumes."", ""So I'm on a search for a true jasmine scent. And A La Nuit is not a very good jasmine scent. I do smell a true jasmine note in it but it is overpowered by the honey note. And to be honest, I don't find honey and jasmine working together very well. Jasmine has a beautiful fresh sweetness to it but the thick sweetness of honey seems to hide it. So I decided to continue my search for a true jasmine scent and leave A La Nuit for others to enjoy. BUT as it lasts a long time I could still smell it on my sleeve the next day as I had tested it on my wrist. And there it was! My beloved jasmine. With only a slight hint of honey. What should I do now? Still buy it and spray it on my clothes a day before using them?"", 'This is probably the easiest perfume to review. Its like putting jasmine absolute on your skin. Its all fresh picked jasmine, on a sunny, crisp day. Not very strong, on me. Sillage is kind of lacking too. Very linear scent. But if you adore Jasmine, this is a must try. Im a little bored with it to be honest.', ""Pow! Juicy, juicy jasmine! Intensely strong and sweet on application, but calms down after a while. On me, this is ALL jasmine (okay, a bit of honey, too), turning softer and creamier with time. I do like this!  I don't know if I sense benzoin or grenadine in it. Mind you, I need to train my nose to recognize ingredients. (And if that means I have to keep testing fragrances -- well, then! -- I'll just HAVE to!)"", ""A La Nuit is to die for. This is the ultimate jasmine scent. Jasmine is the star of the fragrance, but this jasmine isn't shrill. It's warm, sultry and sweet. This smells like the essence of a real jasmine flower, not soapy or indolic in any way. I'm going to be needing a bottle of this, stat."", 'This. is. The One. An absolutely swoon-worthy jasmine. A La Nuit is a pure, rich, fleshy and REAL jasmine scent. I literally feel like I just put my nose far inside a blooming jasmine flower and took a long deep breath. An incredibly sultry and seductive fragrance. For jasmine lovers (raising my hand), this is the ultimate. Christopher Sheldrake is my hero.', 'Got my sample from TPC today. I had such expectations but...,even though it is a very nice fragrance, it\'s not sweet enough for mee. The ""green feel"" someone mentioned is too strong for my liking. I would have preferred a more ""Alien"" kind of scent. Love the jasmine but too sharp, too tarte. I prefer Serge Lutens Fleur d\'Orange.', 'Triple jasmine! feels very natural to a real scent of jasmine at night, when it smells more intense.Very sexy musk and benzoin, an there is a transparent film of alcohol.Intoxication, but in a good way!', ""A la nuit: for wearing at night, making love in bed or falling asleep with the window open, a crazy white fist in your face, edging into greener territory near the end, and someone discreetly peeing into the bushes.  Beautiful, hot, sexy, languid too, and the closest to walking past a jasmin bush in the evening and being surprised at the intensity of the flowers' aroma that I've come across so far."", ""This is totally out of character for me, so I've no idea how it happened, but I fell madly in love with it.  Apart from it's obvious, stunning beauty I love it for its intoxicating, bright, sunny, cheerful and optimistic nature. I sometimes feel a strange physical urge to go and have a sniff, even when I'm wearing something else, just to cheer myself up. I smell it and I feel happy, it's as simple as that. I've read somewhere that if it was a sound, it would be the high and clear note of tinkling glass. How true! I admit, it is a bit difficult to wear since it's incredibly potent. A tiny drop really goes a long way. Surprisingly, its staying power is rather disappointing (2-3 hours)."", ""Jasmine bomb. White, bitter and sweet jasmine with soft green note into the honey and alcoholic tincture.  Realy beautiful and bright, rich and heady smell, but I can't to wear it."", 'My ex used to say, it´s like sitting under bloody jasmine bush .Very true,it´s bloody good jasmine.But I can´t smell any clove at all.', 'after reading the reviews for this fragrance and checking out the notes, i eagerly ordered a sample....boy am i disappointed! in fact, i wonder if i even have the right sample! all this smells like to me (from start to finish) is lily of the valley. strange, no? i cannot smell any jasmine, and certainly no benzoin. has this happened to anyone else? did i get sent the wrong sample?!', 'I adore Serge Lutens jasmine in this fragrance.', ""Sex in a bottle for me, but in a romantic way. It's a purely sensual, creamy, intimate jasmine -not sharp or unpleasant in any way. Can be smothering if you put too much on though...."", 'i love jasmine, particularly egyptian, and i am delighted with this fragrance. the various jasmines emphasize each other beautifully in this fragrance. the greenish sambac revives the tame egyptian jasmine. it is so sensual and light, really feminine and appealing. another favourite of mine. :)', 'Pure oriental jasmine, weightless and delicate, very gourmand for me, I like the vine character of this flower in it.', ""While Diptyque Olene smells like jasmine green tea, A La Nuit smells just like a bush of star jasmine flowers in full bloom in the California spring. Designer fragrance lovers who enjoy scents like Alien or Armani Code probably won't like this, as those fragrances give us a romaticized sketch of jasmine rather than a photorealistic picture. A La Nuit is for the fragrance lover who appreciates everything about a real jasmine flower, warts and all. It opens up with indoles galore (yes, it's slightly cacapoopooey) and will prevent anyone who hates white flowers from ever trying a jasmine fragrance again. But hear me out. A La Nuit later softens into a beautiful, sweet, creamy and narcotic jasmine. The scent hypnotizes you and forces you to keep sniffing. If you have smelled fresh jasmine and think that it is a seductive scent, then you should at least give A La Nuit a try. To me, it is the epitome of a star jasmine fragrance."", ""The first honey note is complete sorcery. It drops the jasmine bomb and flies away.\u2029 This jasmine has an uncanny translucency that recalls the lilac in En Passant. It feels as if you are standing near it, rather than wearing it. There is dew and earth and snapped stems and wispy trails of honey. \u2029 After the first few minutes, it's achingly light, as some others have mentioned, and it seems to drift in and out in a naturalistic way. It's lovely if you want to feel like you're walking through a garden, but perhaps frustratingly elusive if you want to feel like you're wearing perfume."", 'A very true, strong jasmine. I am talking of a decant I have and cherish dated 2005. Indolic with a passion... if indolic scares you, steer clear! (Don\'t know about the current reformulation.) One of my preferred SL (together with Chergui and Fleurs d\'Oranger). To me it smells so intense, so true to the real flower, like you are standing in front of a full blossoming Jasmine bush, in a hot summer night in a mediterranean country. Hence the name... It reminds me of Morocco or Tunisia: it is luxurious, warm, very feminine. Must be used with a light hand as it can be very ""upfront"" and strong, possibly cloying or headache inducing to some noses... especially in summer. Not office friendly, neither similar public close gatherings (i.e. avoid on planes, cinemas or similar). To be worn with proper attire and with a poise, otherwise it will wear you! I love to smell it on my skin when temperatures cool down, to remind me of summer and vacation days.  Defintely a must try for any jasmine lovers.', 'Oh my God I looooove this. This is the jasmine I’ve been missing in my life. This is almost euphoric it’s so sunshine fresh and uplifting like a perfect summer day. It’s like standing in front of a jasmine bush and inhaling the natural beautiful green from the flower to the leaves. This is demure and angelic. I read that this fragrance is a combination of all the different types of jasmine and the use of the jasmine flower from the bud all the way to it’s demise. It’s giving you the whole life of the jasmine flower from it’s budding first minutes to it’s animalic death. Such innocence here like a little fawn nuzzling the dewy soft jasmine petals on a forest floor. There is a gentle quality to SL fragrances that I’ve experienced that lull me into a quiet mood. My 5 year old smelled this on me rolled his eyes up and sighed. Then he said, “I want to go outside.” Yeah....so good it makes you dizzy and want a walk in nature. Anyway, this fragrance is definitely a jasmine lover’s dream. If you truly love jasmine but not too indolic and spicy like you find in Lust this is a nice option for you. I love both fragrances that celebrate the jasmine flower. This fragrance has a sort of flower on the vine quality that I’m very much digging. This jasmine is delicate, soft, heavy on the stem, and dripping with dew and very green like it’s alive. In fact I’m surprised that Dew isn’t among the notes listed. It just smells that way naturally. Must be those green notes that are sharp at first like the stem of the flower snapped in half right under your nose then it dies down and lingers just adding a tiny bit of freshness. The honey in this isn’t syrupy or thick like it is in Elie Saab or even that noticeable. It’s INCREDIBLY light. I feel like the description is missing the word “Fresh.” But not in an aquatic way, this smells like fresh cut narcotic jasmine. There is also an animalic twinge there. This jasmine seems to go though all the stages from fresh all the way to it’s demise. Now that I have a more developed notes I recognize just how animalic this fragrance is it’s got a musky quality of jasmine that the green note and the menthol like clove slices through with a vaporous knife. All the other notes in this fragrance just support that beautiful jasmine note so smoothly and brilliantly and are basically creating a jasmine soliflore. All this creates a photorealistic fresh realistic jasmine. So far I’m very impressed with Serge Lutens. I can’t wait to add more from this house to my collection. Monsieur Lutens is a poet with scent. Like any great artist he takes me to a visceral place. But his art is a place of beauty, positivity, nostalgia, a zen like meditation. I’m gives me a rush of dopamine. I know I sound a bit overboard but I feel this fragrance. It has a soul.', ""This is absolutely intoxicating naturalistic jasmine with honey. Exactly like putting your head into an actual jasmine bush. I've yet to smell any other jasmine perfume that could come even close to the real thing. Since I've had it, I'm bearing a curse of comparing all of them to A La Nuit. No replacement has been found yet. It's intense, very easy to overspray. Don't think it's headache inducing if you don't overspray it - I would've noticed. But if you do, I think it could be, potentially. For this? Worth risking in my opinion. Just to say it again: A La Nuit is NOT DISCONTINUED. They moved it to the bell jar collection, it's available from the official website now. It sure made it less accessible though."", '...Вымаливала молний ночь, Чтобы самой себе помочь И руки к небу возводя Дождя - шептала ночь - дождя.

The animalic part does fade but it doesn't smell good on me. -"", ""Over the years I've tested this on several occasions. My collection lacks a good jasmin and I love several of Lutens' other offerings. So I kept thinking I should at least like this. But something felt so wrong with every test. I couldn't pin it down. Yes there's jasmin, but in a way that really bothers me.  Recently I went for a full confrontation hoping to settle this once and for all. I purposefully oversprayed, as in 8-10 sprays. And finally I could identify what was bothering me: after the short-lived opening of jasmin this becomes full on lilley of the valley on me. That was it all along. Now a sniff at the cap will already reveal the dreaded lotv, so I'll admit defeat with this on."", ""This is the kind of jasmine that I don't like, it's not a heady narcotic tropical sweet jasmine like the jasmine sambac kind but a rather bitter, jasmine green tea kind of jasmine.."", ""On the hunt for my perfect jasmine, I sampled A La Nuit. It smells very much like Montale's Jasmin Full. Both perfumes really pay homage to the jasmine flower. However, I will add that both perfumes contain a slightly bitter, stale soap scent about them that is unpleasant. Where this quality starts out strong in Montale's perfume yet ultimately disappears entirely, it is not so strong in A La Nuit, but it never quite goes away. For this reason, I prefer Jasmin Full. Edited to add: I own La Religieuse, and while I do not like the top notes, the drydown is really beautiful. The jasmine in the drydown is sweeter and more tender than in A La Nuit. A La Nuit is jasmine in full bloom. La Religieuse is the delicate little buds.""]"
